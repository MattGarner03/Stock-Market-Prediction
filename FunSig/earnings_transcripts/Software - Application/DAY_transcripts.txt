===== 2025 Q1  (2025-05-07 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Dayforce First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to David Niederman, Vice President, Investor Relations. David, please go ahead.
David Niederman: Thank you for joining, and welcome to the Dayforce first quarter 2025 earnings call. I'm David Niederman, Vice President, Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] Joining me on the call today are CEO, David Ossip; and CFO, Jeremy Johnson. We also have key Strategy, Product and Technology Officer, Joe Korngiebel, and our President and COO, Steve Holdridge available for Q&A. Before I hand the call over to David, I want to remind everyone that our commentary may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause Dayforce's results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as the cautionary statements in our filings. Additionally, over the course of this call, we'll reference non-GAAP measures to describe our performance. Please review our earnings press release and filings with the SEC for our rationale behind the use of non-GAAP measures and for a full reconciliation of these GAAP to non-GAAP metrics. These documents, in addition to a replay of this call and also transcript will be available on the Dayforce Investor Relations website. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to David.
David Ossip: Thanks, David, and thank you all for joining us. I'll begin with some high-level commentary on our results and outlook before handing the call over to Jeremy, who will provide more detail on our financials and guidance. Dayforce performed well throughout the first quarter. Our sales momentum continued, building off the strong performance we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2024, and our sales pipeline remains in excellent shape. Project kickoffs are up significantly following two strong sales quarters and go-lives remain on track. These key indicators give us confidence for 2025 and 2026. Specific to the first quarter, total revenue was $482 million, growing 14% on a constant currency basis. Excluding float, total revenue grew 17% on a constant currency basis. Dayforce recurring revenue, excluding float, grew 16% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 32.5%, up 240 basis points year-over-year, and free cash flow of $19.5 million was up significantly versus last year, keeping us on track to achieve our full year target of 12%. Our value proposition of providing companies with the ability to simplify their people operations at scale by streamlining their HCM software stack continues to resonate with current and potential customers. Dayforce allows organizations to reduce the number of applications from an average of 12 down to the single Dayforce application. With Dayforce, customers can operate with confidence, empower their workers and obtain a tangible ROI. Even during periods of economic uncertainty, this value proposition allows our teams to continue building sales pipeline and results. From a sales perspective, Sam and his team are achieving superb results. We had the best first quarter in our history, and we anticipate bookings in the first half of 2025 will continue to be strong and in line with the Q4 of last year. Results were distributed nicely across most of our segments and geographies with healthy growth in each of our key segments. Our back to the base sales strategy is performing well with Q1 sales to existing customers growing 30%. In the first quarter, we secured several key new business wins, selected highlights include: a large entertainment and leisure company that chose the complete Dayforce suite as its unified HCM solution to support 61,500 employees across North America. A leading uniform and workplace solutions provided that selected the full Dayforce suite to support its 22,000 employees across North America, a leading North American utility infrastructure service provider that selected the full Dayforce suite to modernize and unify its systems supporting over 9,000 employees, a global safety solution provider that selects the full Dayforce suite, including managed payroll and managed benefits to support 8,000 employees across 30 countries in North America, EMEA, LATAM and APJ, and a leading North American civil engineering and heavy construction company that selected the full Dayforce suite to support its more than 7,200 employees, consolidating 14 systems into one. Live customers on Dayforce platform grew 5.4% to 6,929, and Dayforce recurring revenue per customer grew 11.5% to $167,600. Turning to our partner efforts. Our system integrated channel is performing well with our top SI partners delivering an outsized impact. SI prime deals won during the first quarter were up significantly versus last year and exceeded our expectations, underscoring strong alignment and demand generation across strategic accounts. We're seeing a growing partner-led pipeline and an increase in co-sell velocity across regions. We also announced a partnership with Microsoft, which puts Dayforce on the Azure marketplace. This launch makes it easier for enterprise customers to adopt the Dayforce platform with the security, scalability and streamline procurement. On the product side, we continue to make excellent progress. In the quarter, we extended our AI copilot to our native iOS and Android apps. Copilot is performing well. In Q1, 50% of new deals had it attached. We also enhanced our talent modules with personalized updates for the Advanced Experience Hub, improve the intuitiveness and workflows of our learning and recruiting modules and launched new direct-to-bank capabilities for Dayforce Wallet that allows employees to route their pay to any personal bank account. And as always, we continue to remain a solid core of compliance, releasing features like the total remuneration package calculation for comprehensive compensation management and compliance enhancements for global statutory requirements in the United Kingdom, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand. And finally, a brief update on our engagement with the government of Canada. Our teams continue to work towards configuration and delivery milestones outlined by the government of Canada. The GOC has signed a 15-month contract to extend the configuration work through go-live. I'll now pass the call to Jeremy to discuss our financial results in more detail. Jeremy, over to you.
Jeremy Johnson: Thanks, David. We are pleased with our first quarter results. Top line revenue growth remained strong, while we scaled the business and continued to expand cash flow margins. Before I get to the numbers, I want to highlight a refreshed look to the face of our P&L, where we have removed the gross profit break and broken out depreciation and amortization on one line. We also simplified the disaggregation of revenue tables in our press release and MD&A to simply show four revenue lines: Dayforce recurring, Powerpay recurring, other recurring and float recurring, which sum to total recurring revenue as shown in our P&L. With these changes, we will no longer refer to cloud revenue or profitability. As of this quarter, 96% of our recurring revenue, excluding float is from Dayforce or Powerpay, what we've historically referred to as our cloud solutions. Our goal with these changes was to improve comparability between Dayforce and our software peers and make it easier for users to analyze our financial performance as we continue to grow and scale the business. Now turning to our first quarter results. Total revenue was $481.8 million, up 11.7% on a GAAP basis and 13.6% on a constant currency basis. Excluding float, total revenue increased 15% on a GAAP basis and 17.1% on a constant currency basis. Dayforce recurring revenue, excluding float was $323.1 million, up 14.4% on a GAAP basis and 15.9% on a constant currency basis. Professional services and other revenue was $71.3 million, up 46.1% on a GAAP basis and 49.8% on a constant currency basis. Operating profit was $31 million and adjusted EBITDA was $156.7 million, up 20.6% or a 32.5% margin expanding 240 basis points. Operating cash flow was $49.6 million and free cash flow was $19.5 million versus negative $18.8 million last year. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue was 4%, expanding 840 basis points. During the quarter, we announced an efficiency plan and the reduction of our global workforce by approximately 5%. We expect our original estimates of pretax cost savings to remain accurate, that is $65 million in savings in 2025 and $80 million of savings annualized. In connection with this plan, we incurred a nonrecurring restructuring charge in the first quarter of $29.2 million including severance, employee benefits and related costs and noncash stock compensation. These savings were reflected in our initial 2025 guidance and, of course, remained reflected in our reiterated 2025 guidance. On share repurchases, we repurchased $30.4 million of shares or approximately 519,000 shares during the quarter under our $500 million share repurchase program. Cumulative to date, we have returned more than $66 million of capital to shareholders under this program. We still anticipate continuing to purchase shares in 2025 with the goal of minimizing dilution to our shares outstanding from stock-based compensation. Overall, it was a solid first quarter and a nice start to 2025. A few comments on what I'm seeing in the macro before we move to our guidance. First, we saw a solid demand environment in the first quarter. As David said, our sales momentum continued building off the strong performance we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2024. Our HCM solutions and value propositions continued to resonate with buyers. It's also important to note that we haven't seen a change in customer retention and continue to expect retention rates at our historical ranges. Second, employment levels were largely in line with our expectations during the first quarter. As we invoice on a per employee per month basis, employment levels at our customers do have a direct impact to our revenue. However, we do have minimums built into most contracts at about the 80% level. We'll continue to monitor these employment levels and report to you as we progress throughout the year, but do not see any to adjust our outlook or guidance related to employment levels. Regarding interest rates, which impact Dayforce through our float revenue, we now expect three rate cuts in the U.S. in the back half of the year compared to one rate cut previously assumed in our original guidance. However, with Q1 float revenue coming favorable to our expectations on average -- higher average balances and higher yield, we are comfortable holding our full year float revenue guidance. For full year 2025, we still expect mid- to low single-digit growth in average balances and an effective yield of about 3.6%. And finally, foreign exchange rates. In Q1, FX rates were in line with our expectations. However, since the announcement of tariffs, we have seen the U.S. dollar weakened. This weakening has the impact of increasing the U.S. dollar amount of both revenue and expenses. So we've updated our Q2 guidance to align to the average FX rates we saw in April, but we've left the rest of the year assumption flat with our original guidance. All of the rates that we've used in our guidance for U.S. dollars to Canadian dollars, Australian dollars and British pound can be found in our press release. And just a reminder that we are naturally hedged from FX on an EBITDA perspective. We provide constant currency growth rates in our guidance for this purpose. And to be clear, we are leaving constant currency growth rates unchanged to prior guidance. Now turning to our guidance. As I mentioned, we are reiterating our previously issued full year 2025 guidance on a constant currency basis, but you'll note the dollar amount of guidance to reflect the Q2 FX rates. Specifically, we expect total revenue of $1.929 billion to $1.944 billion. Total revenue, excluding float of $1.749 billion to $1.764 billion, an increase of 12.1% to 13.1% or 14% to 15% on a constant currency basis. Dayforce recurring revenue, excluding float of $1.317 billion to $1.342 billion, an increase of 13.6% to 15.7% or 15% to 17% on a constant currency basis. Float revenue of $180 million, adjusted EBITDA margin of 32% and free cash flow margin of 12%. And for the second quarter, we expect total revenue of $454 million to $460 million, total revenue, excluding float of $408 million to $414 million, an increase of 9% to 11% or 10% to 11% on a constant currency basis, float revenue of $46 million and adjusted EBITDA margin of 30.5% to 31.5% of revenue. With that, we can begin the Q&A portion of our call.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho Securities. Your line is now live.
Siti Panigrahi: Thank you. I want to -- can you hear me?
Jeremy Johnson: Yes, we got you, Siti.
Siti Panigrahi: All right. So I want to ask about this -- in this macro environment. What are you hearing from your customer mainly for their HR and payroll project. David, you talked about strong sales pipeline and project kickup. Wondering if you're seeing anything different in the U.S. versus international market given what we have seen last month or so?
David Ossip: Siti, thanks for the call. Let me start by saying this. Bookings in Q1 were very strong. They were in line with what we saw in Q4 of last year. And if you recall, bookings in Q4 were very strong as well. When we look at the month of April, bookings continued to be very strong. And in terms of numbers, we would expect the first half bookings to be up approximately 40% year-over-year. As you know, it takes a bit of time for that to translate into revenue. But that obviously gives us tremendous confidence as we go into 2026 and beyond as well. If I actually dissect the sales, add-on sales, as I mentioned on the call, were up 30% year-over-year, and that means that we are seeing more new customers signed with Dayforce. Where I'm very encouraged is when I look at our strategy of building out a single application, and I look at the percentage of full suite deals that we are now doing for new customers. We saw full suite deals be approximately 50% of the total deals we did in the quarter, but we're not actually dissected and I look at the major market space, the enterprise space and emerging space, again, emerging 500 -- up to 500 employees, major markets up to 3,500 enterprise above 3,500 employees but below 12,000. We're seeing almost 100% of those particular segments by full fleet deals. And obviously, that's very encouraging. We're also seeing impact from the SI channels, SI prime deals were 50% overall, and we're gaining traction with our managed offering which is also up quite considerably year-over-year. It's up by about 70% year-over-year, but still less than 10% of sales. So still tons of room to actually grow. So we haven't seen impact at all from the macro in terms of buying decisions. When we look at project kickoffs, obviously, following a very strong Q4 and a very strong Q1 of sales, you would expect that kickoffs would be also up significantly year-over-year. And again, that gives us confidence into 2026 and beyond.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Scott Berg from Needham & Company. Your line is now live.
Scott Berg: Hi everyone. Nice quarter. Thanks for taking my questions here. David, on the fourth quarter call, you had mentioned some increased demand strength on HRMS and payroll deals upmarket and the kind of the larger enterprise segment that you all play in. How has that played out kind of 90 days later? Are you still excited about that segment? I know you're overall sales and pipeline commentary is really good, but those deals tend to have a longer sales cycle. So I guess just trying to understand how that setup looks like maybe in the second half?
David Ossip: It's continued as well, Scott. Thanks for the question. In fact, in the first quarter, we signed our largest deal ever, which is another government agency that will probably have similar characteristics to what we've seen from the government of Canada deal. So in other words, obviously, it starts with scoping, a bunch of service work, and that will lead to quite nice recurring revenue into the actual future. We also are simply being quite successful at selling full suite deals into the large enterprise space as well. The entertainment and leisure company we spoke about would be a perfect example of that. That's about 62,000 employees. So we saw strong sales performance across segments and across geo in the first quarter, and we've seen that continue in the month of April as well.
Operator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Mark Marcon from Baird. Your line is now live.
Mark Marcon: Good morning. Really nice to see the free cash flow margin improvement. Wondering if you can just talk a little bit about the cadence in terms of total revenue growth? It looks like you're basically projecting for the second quarter on a total revenue perspective, to see a little bit of a deceleration. And then I'll pick up in the second half. Wondering if you can just talk to some of the dynamics that would be driving that.
Jeremy Johnson: Yes. Thanks, Mark. It's good to hear from you. Look, maybe I'll start with Q1 total revenue and then we can move into the full year. The primary drivers between that 14% kind of constant currency revenue growth is -- look, we were up about $58 million year-over-year. You can look at that as mostly Dayforce recurring, $45 million up. Professional services had a really strong quarter that was up about $23 million, $24 million. Powerpay was relatively flat, and then we had the headwinds from other recurring, which was down about 6% and float was down about 4%. Now the Dayforce recurring, that drive is driven mostly by go-lives. You can generally think about that as mostly new business and now seeing a greater proportion of add-ons. We also had some migrations from the APJ business, which is driving that $6 million -- part of that $6 million decrease in the other recurring and professional services and other was a huge increase in Q1. As you move into Q2 and beyond, you've got some seasonality in there. Our seasonality primarily around the Dayforce recurring side of things comes from the year-end solutions. If you think about our year-end services in the past, you should think about that pretty consistently year-over-year, which drives that same seasonality between Q1 and Q2, and that's how I would think about it. In Q2 also, I wouldn't expect as much growth in the professional services side. We grew 50% in Q1. I would expect that still above the recurring growth, as I talked about in the first quarter, but not at 50% level. We're seeing strength in that number from obviously, all the demand that we've seen in Q4 and into Q1. On Powerpay side of things expected relatively flat. And then obviously, we -- that other recurring in the bureau side goes down. The last piece of that is the float. And think about float as I think we gave specific guidance on this one, kind of average balances in the $5 billion range. That's -- and an effective yield of about 3.6% for the second quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Mark Murphy from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.
Mark Murphy: Thank you so much. I'll add my congrats, Jeremy. I'm curious how you're seeing the trends in some of your industries that are most acutely affected by tariffs, thinking about airlines, retailers, maple syrup, energy providers, all that. Is there anything in the pipeline or employment levels that's reflecting any of the trade tensions yet when you look at the forward indicators? And then just -- on the Azure marketplace set up, can customers burn down their Azure credits to purchase Dayforce?
David Ossip: Mark, I'll start with the easy question. Yes, they can burn down their Azure market credits, which is a big part of the actual partnership as well, it does benefit the SIs from the same perspective. To the first part of your question, we haven't seen impact from the tariffs.
Operator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Kevin McVeigh from UBS. Your line is now live.
Kevin McVeigh: Great. Thanks so much. David, you talked about that Canadian contract a little bit. I just want to make sure I understood, do they extend that contract? Was the dollar amount increased? I just -- could we start there real quick?
David Ossip: Sure. On the Canadian, so there are two points over there. The first was, Kevin, we actually signed another federal agency contract with another government in Q1, similar types of dynamics to what you have with the Government of Canada deal. In regards to the Government of Canada deal, yes, they did sign an extension. It was a dollar amount of CAD 105 million, USD 72 million, that will -- is mostly for services or additional services over the next, I think, 15 months. So obviously, that bears quite well for that project. But the comment that I made earlier was another government contract that we started in Q1.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Samad Samana from Jefferies. Your line is now live.
Samad Samana: Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question. Maybe just if I think about the guidance, it's a strong start to 2025. If you think about that range that you're reiterating, maybe help us understand what would allow you to get to the high end? Would that be bookings that have already been captured going live earlier than expected? Or would that be more of a function of out executing on bookings in the first half? Just -- as I think about that 15% to 17% constant currency, you guys split the middle in 1Q. How should we think about where you think you can land in the range? And as of today, are you thinking closer to the middle where you started or towards the higher or lower end?
David Ossip: So Samad, nice to speak with you. I'll start and I'll hand it over to Jeremy. As you know, we have a very predictable business. We model out the revenue based on individualized projects tied to each of the different customers that we currently have in process and that shapes the revenue curve, if you like, for the various types of quarters. In terms of what could impact the second half of the year. One, obviously, we are benefiting from the strong Q4 and the strong Q1 sales. A portion of those will go-live in October. And then the remainder most likely would go-live at the end of December for the fiscal year '26. There are some assumptions that we do have regarding the macro in terms of employment levels and obviously, yields for the remainder of the year that kind of Jeremy went through in a bit of detail. Jeremy, what else would you add to that?
Jeremy Johnson: I think that's right. Employment levels are the key things to watch for us that's really kind of out of our control from a macro side of things. And to be clear, we haven't seen an impact to our expectations from employment levels yet. So if we kind of look at things right now, it's steady as she goes. I think otherwise, no difference from prior years. It's add-on sales. As David mentioned, its go-lives. We've got our wallet business, which continues to go strong and in line with our expectations and retention, which also, as I mentioned, is very strong as well.
Operator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is now live.
Raimo Lenschow: Okay, thank you. You said everything is on plan. The one question I have that is related to that. It's like on the go-lives in Q1, is that just like the shape of where things were playing out with Q4 being very strong, et cetera? And in Q1, with bigger projects, do you get more pushes in the later part of the year? Or is there anything else going on there?
David Ossip: Raimo, that's exactly right. If you look at Q4 of last year, it was up quite significantly relative to the year before. 146 versus 147. When you look at it, remember, you have to look at really where the days of week aligned relative to the start of the payroll period for the customers. So in some years, the go-lives are skewed towards Q4 and other years are skewed towards Q1, and you see that part as the year progresses between the differences between the actual quarters.
Operator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Jared Levine from TD Cowen. Your line is now live.
Jared Levine: Yes. Thank you. With your recently announced efficiency plan, can you discuss the primary expense items in the income statement, expecting to see the benefit from the efficiency plans as well as the associated charges and how you're thinking about how much of those savings will be reinvested back into the business?
Jeremy Johnson: Yes. Jared, it's good to hear from you. Thanks for the question. Yes, I talked about this a little bit on the scripted remarks. But -- and we talked about this since -- it's -- we reviewed the entire company from a functional and geographic perspective. And the cuts really span broadly across both of those two vectors. I think going forward, you should expect to see more leverage from G&A, and we'll continue to drive slight scale in product and sales and marketing costs. And then our plan has always been to continue to improve recurring gross margins and our professional services gross margins when we get towards that breakeven line. The impacts and the savings are around $65 million in year and $80 million annualized. That's offset by, call it, about $10 million of investment that we put back into the business on some specific projects. As far as the onetime charges in connection with the plan, we incurred a nonrecurring restructuring charge in the first quarter of about $29 million. That includes severance costs, that includes employee benefits and related costs, it also includes noncash stock compensation. And those savings, as we've talked about, were reflected our initial 2025 guidance and of course, remain reflected in our reiterated guidance. In Q1, it was about $11 million, and you'll see this in the notes to our 10-Q, $11 million of restructuring charges that were paid. And that means we have a liability of about $18.6 million the combination of those two gets you to the $29 million.
Operator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Steven Enders from Citigroup. Your line is now live.
Steven Enders: Okay. Great. Thanks for taking the question this morning. I wanted to ask just on the, I guess, the bookings and pipeline opportunity that you're seeing. I think last quarter, you talked about new sales coming in above total revenue growth. And it seems like it's looking that way for 1Q based on what you're seeing. But do you feel the same way as you look out in the pipeline for the back half of the year? Or kind of what are you seeing in the pipeline dynamics right now?
David Ossip: Thanks for the question. As I mentioned on the call, the pipeline remains healthy. Q1 bookings were very strong. We expect that to continue through Q2 as well. Again, from a number perspective, we would expect year-over-year sales to come in about 40% greater than we saw in the prior year and in line with what we saw in Q4. So we're quite optimistic and confident on the sales front.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Alex Zukin from Wolfe Research. Your line is now live.
Ryan Krieger: Hi, guys. This is Ryan Krieger on for Alex. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to circle back on some of the AI commentary, David, that you provided. It sounds like attach is really strong there, particularly around Copilot. So just kind of curious what type of maybe PEPM uplift you're seeing in those AI deals versus the non-AI deals and how that compares to initial expectations? And then just beyond Copilot, kind of what other AI features are you seeing good traction?
David Ossip: Sure. So on the AI assistant, which is the new name, if you like, for Copilot, we saw a 50% attachment rate of that particular skew to new deals. That's obviously very encouraging. We are launching a series of AI agents this year across all the various domains that we play in, so HR, payroll, time and talent. You'll see those coming out through the year, and that obviously gives us another ability to see a revenue uplift or skew uplift. We still have tremendous white space across our almost 7,000 customers where we can go back and upsell them the advanced experience hub with the AI assistant. What you'll see actually, if you look at the application today and the features that we're releasing is that AI is everywhere. We have a distinct advantage over the others in that we have a single database, a single native code base, and that allows us to really leverage that single database to drive AI in every touch point from the employee frontline manager all the way to the executive. In terms of the agents, we have two different types of agents. We have agents that are designed for their employee, and we have agents that are designed for the administrator. And I think the customers will benefit greatly from the innovation that we're doing around AI.
Operator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Brad Reback from Stifel. Your line is now live.
Brad Reback: Great. Thanks very much. David, on what appears to be a meaningful acceleration in sales force productivity, is that coming from a meaningful uptick in win rates out in the field, growing pipeline top of the funnel, DSI? Maybe you can talk to that a little bit.
David Ossip: Yes. Thanks for the question. So let me break it down. Yes, we've seen our win rates go up significantly year-over-year. If I were to estimate, I would say they've almost doubled in terms of our win rates. I don't know how much further we could take the actual run rates. What is resonating very well is our technology leadership that we have that single code base, a single database. We do the 12:1 simplification is resonating with the actual market. We're seeing that reflected in the percentage of full suite deals that we're now doing. If I would look at Joe's strategy, when he joined the organization about three, four years ago, which was to build a full suite, so from pre hire to retire code base, that is gaining traction. Again, when we look at kind of the major market space, which is that 500 to 3,500 employee or we look at the enterprise space, we've seen full suite deals in major markets of about 90% and full suite deals in enterprise of 100%. So that's one of the reasons that you're seeing our win rates go up. You've seen the acceleration of the actual sales. I do believe we are quite differentiated in the segments that we play on. Our global payroll story as well is very, very strong, and we're still seeing traction on that. Our advantage in managed services, which have to do with the payroll and on the benefit side is a very, very strong differentiator that's up 70% year-over-year. And I would say that the execution of the sales organization led by Sam is working very, very well that they're able to articulate the value proposition clearly. Customers understand how that results in very strong ROI to their organization, much better experience. We're obviously writing the AI kind of wave just given our advantage of having that single code base and that very well structured data set that allows us to leverage kind of large language models and other ML types of technology very, very effectively to the benefit of our customer bases. But as you can tell, we're very optimistic on the sales side.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Daniel Jester from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now live.
Daniel Jester: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe two real quick ones for Jeremy. First, on free cash flow. First quarter was very strong. I think historically, your first quarter cash generation is a little bit lighter. So can you help us think about the seasonality for the rest of the year? And then secondly, on the Government of Canada contract, the new USD 72 million that David mentioned. Is that net new? Or was some of that already contemplated in your guidance for the year?
Jeremy Johnson: Thanks, Dan. It's good to hear from you. The seasonality in free cash flow will continue. Q1 is the lower sales quarter you've got -- or excuse me, the lower free cash flow quarter, you've got things like bonus runs for our employees, you've got annual subscription to go out the door and those things impact our cash flow. You'll see a very similar trend. Obviously, it was the tide raise with our increased cash flow, but a very similar trend to past years on a quarterly basis, and as we progress towards that 12% free cash flow margin in our guidance. As you think about the Government of Canada, it's -- the work is continuing, I think, really, really nicely that substantive contract that we signed continues the professional services work, and that will continue to help drive that growth, professional services revenue growth above the recurring growth for the near-term here as we continue to work through that project. David, anything to add on the Government of Canada?
David Ossip: No, just I do think it is a sign of confidence on the actual project is consistent with what the government has said in prior years. Obviously, there was some risk going into the quarter with the elections that were going on, but I think we came in of that rather well. I think you'll see that reflected as well in the professional services and other line, which if you look at kind of the professional services and other adjusted margin, it's really improved very, very nicely. In terms of the guidance comment, yes, we had made assumptions that the project would continue and this obviously derisks that item, gives us certainty about the revenue stream.
Operator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Jason Celino from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now live.
Zane Meehan: Great. Thank you. This is Zane Meehan on for Jason this morning. Just a question on wallet. The customers that are using wallet, what level of utilization are you seeing by their employees? And in periods where macro might be more uncertain or tighten, would you expect for that utilization to increase?
David Ossip: That's an interesting question. With the actual wallet product, we have on-demand pay, where the employees are able to move their earned wages onto their Mastercards and they can go off and obviously spend. For that particular product, it's largely for, I would say, the unbanked employees in the United States, which allows them to avoid check cash-in fees. It allows them to not have to do payday loans to bridge their finances. For those employees, we're seeing a very, very high utilization rate. Typically, they use the product about 25x per month with an average spend of about $25. It's been largely consistent, that type of utilization since we launched. We also have direct deposit capability, which is at the end of the pay period instead of having the money deposited to a direct deposit account or a paper check. We allow employees to get paid through direct deposit directly to the wallet. The benefit for the employee is that the money transfer happens immediately, whereas when we do direct deposit to other bank accounts, we go through the ACH system, which takes between 24 and 48 hours. Again, with the unbanked employees, this gives them a effectively a bank account, which allows them to get the money very, very quickly. We also have capability if employees have other cash apps or if they want to do instant transfer, we call that AFT and IFT, where people can do the transfers immediately or pull the money from the other wallets. We launched that last year, and that immediately got a lot of traction, and we'll continue to see that traction grow. Earlier this year, we launched direct to bank capability. We started first with the ability of when someone does an on-demand pay transaction, instead of going to the Mastercard that we provide, they have the ability to use any debit card. And there is a fee for that. We launched that. That's going very, very nicely. We're seeing effectively the revenue from that go up by a few thousand dollars each day of week relative to the same day of week last year. So we're very confident that will generate several million dollars of revenue over there. And more recently, we just launched the ability for someone to do an on-demand transaction to any direct deposit account that they actually have as well. The last two items that I spoke about are largely focused around not the unbanked employees but rather the bank employees. So we would expect to see a benefit to wallet this year from those capabilities much like we saw from AFT and IFT last year.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Bhavin Shah from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live.
Bhavin Shah: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I think earlier you spoke about migrating customers from the APJ legacy business over to the Dayforce, how is that going relative to your expectations? And kind of what kind of uplift are you seeing as you migrate them from the legacy platform to the more modern Dayforce solution?
Jeremy Johnson: Thanks for the question, Bhavin. And yes, you can see in our other -- this is most clearly in our other recurring line where that was down about 29%, 30% year-over-year. And in the future, in Q2 and Q3, I actually think that percentage could even accelerate above that into the 40% ranges. We made some decision to really aggressively kind of move customers and target customers either over to Dayforce or off so that we can drive the efficiency and the profitability of the company a little bit faster. As the customers move over and migrate over, we do get an uplift. That uplift varies contract to contract. But it's a pretty decent uplift probably on average, 50% or so. And we continue to see that as we move customers over.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.
Michael Turrin: I appreciate you taking the question. David, some notable commentary on bookings throughout the call would be useful to hear your perspective on the competitive landscape, how that's evolving? And if you can compare and contrast what you're seeing between mid-market and enterprise as well as speak to some of the consolidation opportunities you're highlighting in the press release. That's all helpful.
David Ossip: So regarding the competitors, as I mentioned, we've seen our win rate go up by almost double, if you like, year-over-year. And so that gives evidence that I think our product is performing very well, and we are gaining market share. Our overall market share still is relatively low, probably under 4%. So it gives us a lot of optimism that we should be able to be a market taker for quite some time going forward. What's driving this is that we are quite unique with our single database model, a native code for all aspects from pre hire to retire. It does allow an organization to do that 12:1 simplification. And as they do that, they typically pay less subscription. They save a tremendous amount of labor costs and that they don't have to support 12 different systems when they move to a single Dayforce application and equally important they have the ability to do much better decision-making because the data is all accessible and it's all in the same data store, and they can leverage newer technology like language models, machine learning and other AI type of tech, which obviously benefits everyone from their frontline worker to the executives. The value proposition, I think, is being understood by the market. And I think if people do field research, they'll find that the product truly is differentiated. In terms of the competitive market, we haven't really seen much of a change. Our competitive market set has been largely the same, which is one other HCM provider that obviously has a few headwinds and then the typical ERP players as we go more and more upmarket. We've seen, again, tremendous success with full suite sales all the way from emerging to the enterprise space. So up to that 12,000 employee space. And we are beginning to see success with full suite sales in the large enterprise market. Again, like I mentioned, the entertainment and leisure company of about 62,000 employees behind the full suite. Our focus, again, remains on organizations that have frontline workers, which is the majority of the actual workforce. As you know, we have always focused that we have the continuous calculation. We've been the leader in compliance for quite some time. We continue to invest in compliance. Last year, we did over 900 compliance features. I called out some of the compliance features we did on a global basis in the first quarter of this year. And I think that continues to be a very, very strong differentiator, and now when you couple that with our really competitive talent offerings and data offerings and managed services offerings, we're a difficult organization to compete with.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question today is coming from Allan Verkhovski from Scotiabank. Your line is now live.
Allan Verkhovski: Hi guys, thank you for taking the question and great to hear about all the booking strength in the quarter. I want to follow up on SIs priming implementation. Could you just go deeper on what business trends you've seen there over the past three months, maybe compared to the year ago period, that would be great.
David Ossip: So let me start by saying that building a powerful SI ecosystem is very important to our organization. Sam, our CRO and his organization has specific targets that we measure in terms of SI involvement in each of our sales, and as well, we measure the percentage of kickoffs and projects that are primed by the SIs. We have different layers or different levels of SI partnerships. We started with the Tier 1s. For example, if we look at the Government of Canada, you'll find E&Y would be the prime on that particular deal. We also deal with CGI on that particular. But we have very strong Tier 1 SI partners that we use typically in the large enterprise space. When we go into the enterprise, major markets and emerging spaces, we typically bring on a different set of SIs along the lines of groups like BDO and such, which are very well geared for delivering quantifiable value to that particular market set. The use of the SIs really allows us to scale the organization without building out a tremendously large services organization. It also helps us in terms of building out the pipeline, influence of the actual pipeline as well. And so we're encouraged with what we're actually seeing on the SI side.
Operator: Thank you. We've reached end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over for any further or closing comments.
Jeremy Johnson: Just want to say thank you very much for attending the call today. We look forward to hosting you on the Q2 call. And also just want to send a special thank you to all the Dayforce employees that are out there supporting this company as we continue to do really, really good work for our customers, existing customers and attracting new customers as well. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-05 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to Dayforce's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. If anyone requires operator assistance during the conference, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, David Niederman, VP of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
David Niederman: Thank you for joining, and welcome to the Dayforce Fourth Quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm David Niederman, Vice President, Investor Relations. As a reminder, all participants are in a listen-only mode and a question and answer session will follow our opening remarks. Joining me on the call today are CEO, David Ossip, and CFO, Jeremy Johnson. We also have Chief Strategy Product and Technology Officer, Joseph Korngiebel, and our President and COO, Steve Holdridge, available for Q&A. Before I hand the call over to David, I want to remind everyone that our commentary may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause Dayforce's results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as the cautionary statements in our filings. Additionally, over the course of this call, we'll reference non-GAAP measures to describe our performance. Please review our earnings press release and filings with the SEC for our rationale behind the use of non-GAAP measures and for a full reconciliation of these GAAP to non-GAAP metrics. These documents, in addition to a replay of this call and also a transcript, will be available on the Dayforce Investor Relations website. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to David.
David Ossip: Thanks, David. And thank you all for joining us. I'll begin with some high-level commentary on our results and outlook before handing the call over to Jeremy, who will provide more detail on our financials and guidance. We had a strong year with Q4 sales exceeding expectations and coming in above plan. Sales cycles returned to historical levels, and January proved to be a strong start to 2025. Looking ahead, we expect sales growth to outpace revenue growth throughout the year. Our pipeline coverage gives us confidence starting the year with approximately four times coverage of pipeline compared to our sales target. We had excellent performance in 2024. Total revenue was $1.76 billion, growing 17% on a constant currency basis. Dayforce recurring revenue excluding float grew 21% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.5%, expanding 140 basis points. And free cash flow was $172 million or 9.7% of revenue, expanding 280 basis points. As guided during our Investor Day, we expect total revenue growth in 2025 of 14% to 15% excluding float and on a constant currency basis. Our guidance reflects our decision to focus on higher margin areas of our business while phasing out legacy segments. Therefore, recurring revenue excluding float is 15% to 17% on a constant currency basis during 2025. In terms of our mid-term operating model, we are confident in our ability to exceed the 20% free cash flow margin. Last year, we expanded free cash flow margins by 280 basis points to 9.7%. In 2025, we anticipate this increasing by another 230 basis points to 12%. And for this upward trend to continue over the midterm. On an adjusted EBITDA basis, we are raising our best today guidance by 100 basis points, increasing adjusted EBITDA margin guidance to 32% from 31%. Beyond 2025, over the midterm, we expect adjusted EBITDA to expand by 100 to 150 basis points per year. In the coming years, we anticipate that the total revenue growth will remain close to 15%, while profitability improvements, both free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA, will continue to outpace revenue growth. From a sales perspective, our CRO Sam? Has executed exceptionally well. In the last quarter, we secured several key new business wins including a 60,000 employee grocery chain, an 18,000 employee space exploration company, and a 66,000 employee member-owned retail cooperative. As well as success in expanding deals including a 60,000 employee global manufacturing distributor of paints and coatings, and a global air service provider with 48,000 employees across 35 countries. Many of these deals closed within weeks of customers attending Dayforce Discover event. A testament to the impact of the event and its role in accelerating Q4 sales. On the product side, we continue to lead in innovation and delivery. Our product roadmap is built around compliance, IT simplification, data, and experience. On the compliance front, we delivered more than 900 compliance updates and were once again recognized by Gartner as a compliance leader for firms with more than 1,000 employees, and for firms with more than 2,500 employees. E compliance enhancements included a new workforce insight experience, machine learning-driven labor forecasting, and direct-to-bank capabilities for Dayforce Wallet. Speaking of Wallet, it had a tremendous 2024 with revenue increasing from $12 million to over $30 million. We expect Wallet to continue gaining momentum in 2025. Our IT simplification efforts align with our twelve to one strategy, which consolidates multiple HR systems into a single Dayforce platform. This approach reduces integrations, manual workarounds, and operational complexity while improving efficiency and decision-making. Our leadership in this area was reinforced by our recognition as a leader for the fifth consecutive year in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Cloud HCM solutions for enterprises with more than 1,000 employees. Currently, now twelve to one value proposition we launched a new talent acquisition experience and replatformed Illumi into Dayforce, creating a best-in-class learning experience with strong analytics, content creation tools, and a content store featuring over 90,000 training modules. We expect learning management and content to drive significant client-based sales in 2025. On the data and experience side, we are already seeing strong adoption of our Dayforce integration studio and Copilot products, both of which we demonstrated at Discover. Since launching in November, we have sold more than 60 Copilot units. Copilot integrates with our Experian's hub, allowing CHROs and their teams to create engaging and immersive experiences for frontline workers, managers, and executives. Content within the hub is indexed using AI, enabling users to ask questions and receive contextual responses with relevant reference select. Additionally, Copilot facilitates workflow automation such as requesting time off. Innovation in this area will continue in 2025 with planned releases of AI agents and other new capabilities. At the core of Dayforce is our commitment to product innovation. This is what differentiates us in the market and drives our strong win rate, high customer retention, significant add-on sales, and industry recognition. Turning to customers and go-live. Q4 was impressive. We saw 146 net new customers go live, including a global aviation service provider with over 55,000 employees across 36 countries, a 23,000 employee American entertainment company rolling out full suite talent, a 10,500 employee UK contract catering and support service provider. We now have 6,876 live customers and 7.6 million live active users on Dayforce. Both are approximately 10% year over year. Additionally, Dayforce recurring revenue per customer increased by 11% and our gross retention rate improved from an already strong 97.1% to 98%. From a profitability standpoint, our improvement in adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow was largely driven by improvements in recurring gross margin. Adjusted cloud recurring gross margins were 79.8%, expanding 150 basis points. Resulting from efficiency gains in our support and managed services organizations, greater automation, AI-driven optimizations, and a higher proportion of add-on sales. In 2025, we will continue optimizing our cost basis by improving sales productivity, streamlining our organizational structure, and leveraging lower-cost jurisdictions, automation, and AI. Professional services and other revenues, historically a negative margin business, is expected to break even in 2025. This milestone reflects the investments we have made in automation and partnership systems integrated. Before handing the call over to Jeremy, I want to emphasize four key themes. First, our strength lies in our ability to innovate and deliver exceptional products. Second, we saw robust sales performance in Q4 and are confident this momentum will continue into Q1 and throughout 2025. Third, we have made meaningful improvements across all profitability metrics and we expect these trends to continue in the coming years. Finally, we are positioning Dayforce for sustained revenue growth at levels similar to 2025, while driving towards a 20% plus free cash flow margin. I'll now pass the call to Jeremy to discuss our financial results in more detail, Jeremy, over to you.
Jeremy Johnson: Thanks, David. We are pleased with the fourth quarter results. Top-line revenue growth remained strong while we scaled the business and continued to expand cash flow margins. In the fourth quarter, total revenue was $465.2 million, up 16.4% on a GAAP basis, and 17% on a constant currency basis. Excluding float, total revenue increased 17% on a GAAP basis and 17.6% on a constant currency basis. And Dayforce recurring revenue excluding float was $307.6 million, up 20% on a GAAP basis and 20.4% on a constant currency basis, underpinned by strong go-lives. Hour pay recurring revenue excluding float was $23.1 million, flat on a GAAP basis, but up 2.6% on a constant currency basis. And professional services and other revenue was $71.5 million, up 18% on a GAAP basis and 18.8% on a constant currency basis. Gross profit was $218.6 million, up 28.7%. Operating profit was $28.5 million, while recurring gross margin was 80%, expanding 300 basis points. And on a non-GAAP basis, adjusted cloud recurring gross margin was 80.4%, expanding 230 basis points. And adjusted EBITDA was $129.2 million, up 30.2% or a 27.8% margin, expanding 300 basis points. Turning to our full-year results. Total revenue was $1.76 billion, up 16.3% on a GAAP basis and 16.7% on a constant currency basis. Excluding float, total revenue increased 16% on a GAAP basis and 16.3% on a constant currency basis. Dayforce recurring revenue excluding float was $1.16 billion, up 20.4% on a GAAP basis and 20.7% on a constant currency basis. Hour pay recurring revenue excluding float was $83.7 million, up 2.2% on a GAAP basis and 3.8% on a constant currency basis, and professional services and other revenue was $242.7 million, up 12.2% on a GAAP basis and 12.5% on a constant currency basis. Gross profit was $812 million, up 25.6%. Operating profit was $104.1 million, including $84 million of amortization expense related to the retired Ceridian trade name. Outrecurring gross margin was 78.9%, expanding 190 basis points. And on a non-GAAP basis, adjusted cloud recurring gross margin was 79.8%, expanding 150 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA was $501.5 million, up 22.3% or a 28.5% margin, expanding 140 basis points and reflecting our continued improvement in gross profit margins and scale and adjusted G&A. From a cash flow perspective, full-year operating cash flow was $281.1 million, up 28.1%, and free cash flow was $171.5 million, up 63.2%. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue was 9.7%, expanding 280 basis points. It's a solid year from a financial perspective, with strong revenue growth, expanding profitability, and increasing cash flow metrics. If I look back at our original 2024 guidance issued in February 2024, we met or surpassed these targets with healthy performance throughout the year. If you recall, our initial guidance for 2024 was for total revenue to grow between 13% and 14% constant currency, and we grew 16.7%. Dayforce recurring revenue x float to grow between 20% and 21% constant currency, and we grew 20.7%. An adjusted EBITDA margin between 27.9% and 28.6%, and our margin was 28.5%. We also introduced free cash flow guidance for the first time this year, saying that we expected free cash flow margin between 9.5% and 10% of revenue, with conversion from adjusted EBITDA to operating cash to be in the mid to upper 50% range. While CapEx remained relatively flat year over year. And we ended at 9.7% of revenue, with 56% conversion from adjusted EBITDA to operating cash flow. We're pleased with our overall performance and financial results this year. During the fourth quarter, Dayforce recurring revenue excluding Flow, grew at 20% on a GAAP basis or 20.4% currency. Included in these results was a $2 million FX headwind versus our guidance rates, and while go-lives were solid, employee volumes, tax filing fees, and print fees missed our expectations. And we had impacts from customer contract amendments. The contract amendments were isolated to a few customers and represented changes to terms that caused a reallocation of contract consideration, increasing PS and other revenue, and reducing recurring revenue. Specifically, the impact from employee volumes was approximately $1 million, the contract amendments were approximately $1 million, and the tax filing fees and print fees were each about $500,000. Excluding these items, our Dayforce recurring revenue growth would have been in the middle of our guidance range. We have not changed our previously issued revenue guidance for 2025, which I'll dive into more next. A few other callouts about 2024 before I move on to our guidance. During 2024, Illumina revenue added approximately 190 basis points of growth to our Dayforce recurring revenue ex float, and 110 basis points of growth to our total revenue. During 2024, we executed $36 million of our $500 million share repurchase plan and are pleased that we have the profitability and flexibility to return capital to our shareholders and manage dilution from share-based compensation while maintaining investment in the business. Now turning to guidance, for the full year, we expect total revenue excluding float to grow at a constant 14% to 15%. At current FX spot rates, we estimate this to be $1.745 billion to $1.76 billion, or 11.9% to 12.8% growth on a GAAP basis. Dayforce recurring revenue excluding float to grow between 15% and 17% constant currency. At current FX spot rates, we estimate this to be $1.315 to $1.34 billion, or about 13.4% to 15.5% on a GAAP basis. Float revenue of $180 million representing an effective yield of 3.6% and balance growth in the mid to low single digits. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 32% of revenue, free cash flow margin of 12% of revenue, and in 2025, we now expect PS and other revenue to grow slightly faster than Dayforce recurring revenue excluding float. During 2025 as we continue to implement projects from the strong demand we saw in 2024 and as we continue to work on some larger projects including the government of Canada. For the first quarter, we expect total revenue excluding float to grow 15% to 17% on a constant currency base. Current FX spot rates, we estimate this to be $421 million to $427 million, or growth of approximately 13.5% to 15%. Quote revenue of $53 million representing an effective yield of 3.7% and balanced growth of mid-single digits. And adjusted EBITDA margin of 31% to 32% of revenue. With regard to FX rates, 2025, expect our revenue to be approximately 70% US dollar-based, 21% Canadian dollar-based, 4% to 5% Australian dollar-based, and 3% to 4% British pound-based, with the rest spread across multiple currencies. With the US dollar strengthening against each of these current and with the proportion of our UK and Australia-based revenue increasing, we will begin providing FX rates assumed in guidance for each of these currencies compared to the dollar. For our current guidance, the US dollar to the Canadian foreign exchange rate used is 1.44. The US dollar to British pound foreign exchange rate is 0.81, and the US dollar to Australian dollar foreign exchange rate is 1.61. Specifically, current foreign exchange rates are driving about 200 basis points of headwind to our full-year 2025 revenue growth ranges. A few other things to call out before we close out the call. On share repurchases, we still anticipate continuing to purchase shares in 2025. With the goal of minimizing dilution to our shares outstanding from stock-based compensation. Our current estimate is that we plan to repurchase more than a million shares during 2025, effectively doubling our 2024 purchases. Later today, we are launching a repricing deal for our existing $650 million term loan B with the goal of reducing the interest rate from our current levels of so far plus 250 to something lower. And with regard to our $575 million convertible debt, which matures in March of 2026, we're currently planning to retire this at maturity in 2026 with cash and liquidity on hand. Now with that, we can begin the Q&A portion of our call.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. You may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue. We do ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Today's first question is coming from Siti Panigrahi of Susquehanna Securities. Please go ahead.
Siti Panigrahi: Jeremy, for Q4, Dayforce recurring x float, could you elaborate on the points that impacted the miss and is it something a surprise or and also is it one time or should we expect that in this year too?
David Ossip: Hey, Siti. Nice to speak with you. Let me start before I hand it over to Jeremy. I'd like to make four points that I think are quite key. First of all, Q4 sales and January sales were both up considerably. On a year-over-year basis, both were record, growing at over two times the revenue growth of the company. So we're quite optimistic on sales performance and sales momentum. As you know, generally, when we have a very strong Q4, we see a bit of a headwind going into Q1 and we do not expect that this year. Sales is strong. Second, we're holding the revenue guidance for the company. That's the guidance that we gave at the Investor Day. And at the same time, we're increasing the EBITDA guide for the company by 100 basis points. We're seeing meaningful profit strengthening across all aspects. So adjusted EBITDA, gross margins, and as well as free cash flow. In fact, if you look at it on an adjusted EBITDA basis, you can see that on an x flow basis, we're expecting adjusted EBITDA to go up by 560 basis points inside the year. And finally, we are positioning Dayforce for sustained growth around the current levels moving towards a 20% free cash flow basis. In regards to Dayforce recurring in Q4, there were three aspects that Jeremy can go into detail on those. All of them, I would say, are one-time items that do not impact the future of the company. Some of them have to do with amendments to contracts. There were some FX inside there as well. And as people obviously are moving to more digitization, there has been some impact on the printing and the shipping types of these. Jeremy, do you want to get some details for that?
Jeremy Johnson: Definitely. Yeah. So David mentioned the FX which, you know, we can put aside and talk constant currency and ultimately, there's three drivers to the slightly lower numbers, the roughly all equal weighted. At first, I'd say it's lower employee volumes than expected. Second, it's printed fees and tax filing fees, and third, these contract amendments that shifted revenue into professional services and other and away from recurring. All of them are small, on a dollar basis. On employee volumes, as you probably know, we historically see some a seasonal spike in Q4 employee volumes around the holidays. And that seasonality was slightly muted this year compared to the past. And on the print, a tax filing fee, that's revenue that's invoices used. And therefore, it's a little bit more difficult to forecast. We saw some lower consumption this quarter meaning, you know, for example, less printing than historical levels. And on the contract amendments, it's, honestly, a typical customer motion that we see frequently as customers grow with us and grow their HCM needs with us. It's a type of flexibility and partially what drives our strong gross retention of 98%. We're constantly working with our customers to ensure they're satisfied, and you know, with large customers, when they add services or products, we're required to reallocate that contract to between PS and other and recurring and this quarter, we saw some more services added, which is a good thing for the business and the tailwinds in CS and other. And the headwind in recurring revenue.
Siti Panigrahi: Yeah. Thanks for that color. And, David, that's impressive. And I think your fourth point on the key themes, driving sustainable revenue growth at this level 2025. That's definitely impressive when you compare to your peers who are more in the low double digit. But help us understand what are the factors assumed in that level of, you know, confidence to drive this level of growth.
David Ossip: We are seeing strong sales momentum. Again, if I look towards December, it was a record month. And then we saw the strength continue into January. And as you know, I typically give a bit of a color as to how the current order's going. The other number I'll point to, if you look at the cloud ARR, growth in 2024 it was up 17.9%. And remember, our business is very predictable. If I look at Dayforce recurring across the 2024, we will incur 80 basis points of the guide that we gave at the start of the very year, which I think is quite remarkable for a business of this scale. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Mark Murphy of JPMorgan Chase. Please go ahead.
Mark Murphy: Oh, thank you so much. Congratulations on the strong sales performance at year-end. That's great to hear. Jeremy, I have two quick questions. First of all, Jeremy, regarding the employee volumes that you said came in slightly below expectations. You mentioned the Q4 holiday spike was muted. Do you attribute that to the timing of the holidays for both Christmas and New Year's? We're falling mid-week on a Wednesday. In other words, a temporary blip or, you know, did you see some other type of effect that might linger a bit into Q1?
Jeremy Johnson: No. I didn't see it had that level of detail, anything that I would point to that said would linger into Q1. You know, as I said, historically, we do see that Q4 seasonal spike around the holidays. I think you know, that slightly muted, but then also know, we did have some extreme weather events in the southeast, and, yeah, this year, they're in Q4. And but I it's it's a tough thing for us to forecast and to guide and historically, we've been pretty accurate. And think we still were very accurate. It just you know, was slightly below our expectations, unfortunately.
Mark Murphy: Okay. Understood. And then, David, you're thinking back to the fall. You had mentioned some willingness to consider more transformative M&A. And since then, we've seen Paychex announcing its intent to acquire Paycor. Is it safe to assume that Ceridian would have seen too much overlap with Paycor or isn't as interested in going down market and therefore, perhaps you didn't spend much time considering it and could you shed any light on just whether that acquisition might affect the landscape or open up any opportunities for you as they try to merge the two organizations.
David Ossip: We don't compete against Paychex, and we don't compete against Paycor. It is down market from us. I would expect in the down market side that there should be consolidation because I don't think there's much differentiation in product. Mark, what differentiates Dayforce is our ability to innovate and deliver product. And you see that across the gains that we're having in terms of competitive wins in market, the strength of the Q4 and the January sales of it. So to answer your question, though, I don't think there'll be any impact to Dayforce.
Mark Murphy: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Raimo Lenschow: Hey, thank you and congrats for me as well on a great sales quarter. And how do you think about the sales kind of feeding into revenue next year? Obviously, you know, like, strong quarter, if I look at the guidance for Dayforce, they were slightly below consensus. It maybe might have misnrolled by us. But, like, the contract that you signed, were they kind of contract with longer go-lives, etcetera, that kind of really take should consider. Thank you.
David Ossip: Hey, Raimo. We had strong performance across segments. So we saw large enterprise, which for us is above 12,000 employees perform well. We saw the major market have considerable strength. As well. And we even saw our emerging business which goes up to about a thousand employees, also do very, very nicely. The Australian APJ also performed very well. So there wasn't really a concentration in any one segment. You know, given our scale, it's there we typically have, I'd say, well over a thousand ongoing customer implementations. And as you know, when we plan out or model out our revenue, we look at it from an individual go-live milestone of each of those specific projects. So by the way, the go-live number as well in the portal works very, very strong. The number was, I think, what was Jeremy, a hundred and forty-six net new customer thought it was actually very great. So we go in you know, really with a strong Dayforce recurring. I mentioned a bit earlier. The annual recurring revenue of sales went up by 17.9%. So it just flows throughout the system.
Raimo Lenschow: Okay. Perfect. And then, Jeremy, one for you. The I saw the EBITDA raise, so well done on that one, but you didn't raise the cash flow number, which is kind of where you know, a lot of investors will focus on. Can you talk a little bit about, you know, the puts and takes getting EBITDA higher, but not the cash flow. You know, talk to that maybe a little bit. Thank you.
Jeremy Johnson: Yeah. It's a great call, Raimo. We're raising the adjusted EBITDA guidance by 100 basis points from our previous guide 31 to 32. That represents 350 basis points of expansion. But if you actually exclude the float headwind, it's 560 basis points of expansion year over year. We're doing that through cost control and efficiency. If you think about last year, we invested heavily in sales and marketing, and we're reaping the benefits of the productivity from those investments in 2025. We're leaning into greater automation, we're leaning into AI-driven optimizations across the organization. And we're optimizing our cost base by streamlining our organizational structure and leveraging lower-cost jurisdictions. You know, this is our first year that we're kind of really providing a full free cash flow guidance. At the beginning of the year here. And I have optimism in this number, but I wanted to you know, just kind of hold it at where we're at for now.
Raimo Lenschow: Okay. Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Mark Marcon of Baird. Please go ahead.
Mark Marcon: Hey, good morning and thanks for taking my questions. David, at the very beginning, you mentioned you know, the January was very strong. You also mentioned that sales cycles were going back to historic levels. I assume you mean that they were they aren't lengthening. And how unusual is it to have a really strong January? Typically, a lot of sales, you know, come in towards the end of the quarter. So wondering what that bodes and how much of that was basically an after effect of the release successful meetings that you had in Vegas.
David Ossip: That's actually quite good insight, Trevor, there. We saw an acceleration of sales following our Discover event. They just are numerous examples of where we had organizations come to the actual event. And within, I would say, four to eight weeks, following the event, we were able to complete the actual contracts. I think the way that the organization showed that the product showed at Discover this year was just spectacular. So we're very pleased with it. Generally, if we have a very strong Q4, you typically would go into Q1 with a bit of a headwind because it's tough to reach people in January following the December kind of, you know, craziness that you normally have. So if you see strong sales performance in January following an exceptional December, it is something that I did want to call out. Gives us a lot of confidence on the sales management, Sonny.
Mark Marcon: With regards to this the sales cycles being shortened, do you think that's specific to you, or is that just a general tonal change that's occurred, you know, now that we have some clarity with regards to interest rates as well as the election.
David Ossip: I do think there is an impact of the new administration think they're but, again, I'm not an economist. What I can talk about is what we're seeing in our business. And in our business, we are seeing buyers making purchasing decisions quicker than they did last year.
Mark Marcon: Great. And then can you talk a little bit just on the on the line of we're not the only country that's having elections obviously, Canada is going to schedule some elections coming up. Is there any impact with regards to, you know, the Canadian contract that's coming through either from the elections or from any sort of change with regards to procurement processes in Canada? And do you have any early thoughts this with regards to, you know, given that you've got operations in Canada as well as the US and joint headquarters, how do you think about you know, any sort of potential tariff impact?
Steve Holdridge: Hey Mark, this is Steve Holdridge. Let me take the first part of that and then David may want to talk about the broader Canada environment. In terms of the government of Canada, no. The short answer is we don't expect any impact. We're continuing to work towards our deadlines with the most recent order in contract targeting April 2025. We're on track to achieve those milestones. We don't see we don't expect anything from the announced changes at the prime minister level. We continue to have support. I mean, frankly, we've been at this for four years. And leaders at all levels of government want to make sure people are paid properly. And know? The payroll choice does not get politicized, so we continue to be confident in business as usual.
David Ossip: Regarding the impact of potential tariffs between the US and Canada, it's difficult to project that I suppose the biggest impact would be on the FX rate. Between the US and between Canada. About 21% of our revenue is in Canada. So we do have a there would be a revenue impact in terms of US dollars reporting. We are hedged probably about 70% on the cost side against that. So from an adjusted EBITDA percentage, I don't think there any impact?
Mark Marcon: Great. And then this one last one, number of really nice wins here. Can you talk a little bit about who you you ended up capturing these folks from?
David Ossip: Yes. We as I mentioned last time and for those of you who attended the SCROV, we typically nowadays compete mostly against the ERP. And we seem to be taking away shares from the competitor that we would competed against most historically. I would say that if I look at Q4, the majority of the wins were takeaways from them. Always competing against one of the ERPs. Yep.
Mark Marcon: Congratulations on a terrific sales quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Samad Samana of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Samad Samana: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Appreciate it as always. Maybe first just on the first quarter, I didn't Jeremy, I didn't see a 1Q Dayforce recurring xlope guide. I may have just missed it. I apologize if I did. But is this a change in guidance philosophy? Should we only expect an annual outlook going forward? And I guess any comments on the cadence of DataForce recurring growth as we think about the year?
Jeremy Johnson: Hey, Samad. Good to speak with you. Yeah. Look, we're given Dayforce recurring revenue ex low guidance for the full year. Along with the addition of that free cash flow guidance for the full year as we've grown larger over the years and also established a very strong focus on free cash flow generation. It made sense internally to focus on total top line, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow margin in dollars. And it's really how we're running the business internally and how we measure our own success. So we felt it appropriate to reflect this in our communications with investors. Will obviously still report on those numbers and the like, but ultimately, we think this is the this is how we're managing the business and makes a lot of sense to go forward here. Understood. That makes a lot of sense. And then David, you know, you gave some commentary on the midterm growth expectations beyond 2025 and, obviously, coming up. Off of the heels of the of the analyst day where you gave specific long-term targets. I guess maybe just as we think about how Dayforce recurring explode is expected for 2025, any comments maybe on what you're thinking there for the midterm targets or what you assumed? I just wanted to make sure I have clarity on what we should expect to remain at these levels going forward and how the view on Dayforce recurring is.
David Ossip: Yeah. As I mentioned in the call, we expect them to hold. If I look at the total revenue x float basis, I would expect should be able to sustain about a 15% growth rate into the midterm as we move towards the 20% plus free cash flow. On Dayforce recurring, remember that the business today is almost all a cloud. If I look at the total other recurring business you really are looking at about $43 million, you know, somewhere around there for the full year. So kind of as we kind of enter life, those types of platforms and do the migration to Dayforce, you'll see that line just decline by about 40% year over year in constant currency. And we believe it's time to simplify how we report to the app store market. And the goal over here would be to have the total revenue growing around that 15% at the same time that we get above 20% on a free cash flow basis. We're quite confident that we can do that and that allows us for the two keep that focus on driving profitability as we reach this level of scale. Great. And then maybe just one last one for me. I know this the sales organization is doing well. Clearly, you gave us some comments around sales activity, but in the fourth quarter and the first month of the year. How should we think about how the coverage, that four to one that you mentioned, how does that compare to this time entering 2024? So this time last year, and should we think about that holding fairly constant at current levels?
David Ossip: We try and model the business at about a four times sales coverage level. You know, it ties to the investments that we actually put in marketing pipeline development early sales types of activities, the summits, and etcetera. If your number is too high, your sales cost would go up. And, again, as we're trying to improve the actual profitability, one of the constraining factors is the sales and marketing. That's if you look at the actual numbers, you can see that from a sales and marketing productivity level, we're driving more efficient or higher sales productivity. If you look at the guide for the year, we've got into around 16% versus about 17% last year. And that really drives the size of your pipeline and the expected conversion. The sales productivity numbers that we're seeing now, I would say, are very close to testing class for enterprise software. So we're very happy. From the productivity of the actual Salesforce.
Samad Samana: Great. Thank you, everybody.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Scott Berg of Needham and Company. Please go ahead.
Scott Berg: Hi, everyone. Congrats for me on the strong sales quarter as well. I guess two things. David, wanted to start with your newly announced dig for CI. Agent strategy that you talked about at the conference. Just wanted to see how, you know, customers have responded to that. I know it's early. Probably just enabling the Salesforce and everything with that effectively. But, you know, agents are kind of the craze in our software spaces to your wanna see, how you guys might be benefiting from that.
David Ossip: So, Scott, we've as I think mentioned in my core script, we saw about 60 unit sales of our Copilot after we announced it, at Discover. So we're seeing you know, nice uptake of our AI products in market, and I do believe it does differentiate us relative to others because we're not talking about future capability talking about already generally available functionality that's inside the actual product. It's becoming front and central in the way that we actually position the product. In terms of agents, we've had some agents in market for for that time. Typically around the initiation of workflows like time away from work, and the others. I think you'll see that continue. Joe, I'm not sure if you're on the call, but if you'd like to add a bit more color about some of the enhancements we're doing around the agents.
Joseph Korngiebel: Yeah. No. Thank you for the question, and I appreciate the insight. For us, really, the next working of how we can help customers realize value with Dayforce is with the promise of AI. But we're realizing that promise. Like David said, the 60 new sales just came in a month and a half. And customers are seeing that value and the differentiation of delivered AI innovation. The agents that we deliver in the year ahead will go across our entire suite. From HR through our talent modules, even down to analytics where reports a report writer will automatically build you the reports you need in an instant, just saving your company time and energy. So look for more innovation as we move ahead. It's a big, big differentiator for us as we hit 2025 at speed.
Scott Berg: Understood. Helpful. And then David, on your commentary around partner excuse me, your strong sales pipelines going into this year, you know, you've been pushing on the partner ecosystem over the last you know, maybe twelve, twenty-four months and and spend it to the company. Or how how positively your partner's kind of impacting your view on the improved sales environment? And then as we think about your PS margins going forward, I know obviously some of that's being pushed to to partners. That breakeven viewpoint, is that, like, for the full year in terms of your guidance, or do you just break, you know, over that, you know, kind of get to that breakeven line at at one point one quarter during the year?
David Ossip: Yeah. I first, doctor, first of all, thanks for noticing that. Yes. The improvement in the professional services and other which we expect to be about break even this year is largely the result of the investments we've made with the system integrators and the success that we're seeing in them actually prime the implementation. So we're very excited with that. It's the metric that we look at internally to determine if we're seeing success across the SI channels. Obviously, with that, you would expect that to be partially behind what we're seeing in terms of pipeline development on version of actual sales as they help influence the actual deals. So it's going quite nicely.
Operator: Thank you. We'll move on to the next question. The next question is coming from Steve Enders of Citi. Please go ahead.
Steve Enders: Okay, great. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess maybe just to start, I want to talk about some of the assumptions that maybe you're making for you know, 2025 from a high macro level in terms of, like, employment cadence and maybe some rate cut assumptions and kind of what's being accounted for in there. And I guess, secondarily, if there's maybe you know, any incremental conservatism being accounted for based on, you know, some of those factors you called out that impacted the 4Q, Dayforce performance?
Jeremy Johnson: Yeah. Thanks, Steve. It's good to speak with you. Yeah. We can go into a couple of those assumptions. I think, specifically on the rate cuts, you know, we're assuming bank consensus to kind of inform our forecast there. So Canada just cut rates by 25 basis points at the end of January, and US held flat. So with those cuts kind of built in, you would expect or we would expect about one rate in the US in the middle of the year, at about 25 basis points and also expect Canada rate cuts are to continue at about 25 basis points each meeting until October. So about five more cuts this year. With all of that, you think we'll I we think we'll kind of net out to a yield of about 3.6% on average balances growing in the low to mid single digits this year. On the float side of things. As far as the other assumptions on employment levels, you'd we'd expect that to kind of be in the you know, very low single digits from a growth rate perspective. And certainly are using what we learned in Q4 to inform our forecast and guidance in 2025.
Steve Enders: Okay. Perfect. No. Appreciate the appreciate the commentary there. And then I just want to ask on the pro services performance and that outpacing the growth for the Dayforce recurring growth this year. Can you just maybe help us think through some of the factors impacting that? Like, is that a reflection of some of the managed services capabilities and that we're highlighting and all the say that kind of point through more yeah. Just kind of like what factors should be thinking about in there and kind of what continues moving forward.
Jeremy Johnson: Yeah. I think first and foremost is that we had a really strong sales Q4 to cap off a really strong sales year in 2024. And, you know, we haven't I think with that you see strong sales comes with implementation and services work. And that's kind of the tip of the sphere there, if you will. We've also got some of the larger, you know, projects that we're working through and large customers that we'll continue to do work for. And then if you think about the productivity, I think it's really a few primary drivers. It's, as David mentioned, the systems integrated relationships that it that we've matured. We're doing also a greater proportion of value-added services alongside those systems integrators. We're driving efficiency into our implementation process. We talked about this at the November day, but you know, a few years ago, we began building out these SI relationships and we're really pleased with how these have come together. And how we're driving that efficiency across that implementation process.
Steve Enders: Okay. Great. Thanks for taking the questions.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Kevin McVeigh of UBS. Please go ahead.
Kevin McVeigh: Great. Thank you. Hey, I think you talked about the wallet basically $30 million in 2024 up from $12 million in 2023. Is that adoption or increased usage in any way to think about what that can contribute in 2025?
David Ossip: Yes. In 2024, we released AFT and IFT capabilities to the wallet, and we saw quite good adoption of those types of movements of money. In 2025, we just launched direct to the bank. So what direct to bank is if you do an on-demand pay, the employee can now select to pass that money to one of their existing debit cards attached to an existing checking or savings account. And, we're seeing that actually take off quite nicely as well. We also, obviously, as you would expect, continue to see increases adoption. In terms of more organizations and more employees, use the actual wallet as well. We would expect the momentum on the wallet to continue this year.
Kevin McVeigh: Great. And then at this point, are the SIs driving any sales volume, should they be is that still something that that probably starts in 2025?
David Ossip: Yes, we are. As I think I answered, I think we'll start off question. We're seeing a nice traction with the system integrators. Obviously, strengthened year over year. And you can see that reflected in the professional services and other margin which as we move the implementations more to the SIs, the professional services and other margin now moved towards breakeven. But we're also seeing increased amplification of the brand and increased pipeline with not only the SIs, but with our community advisory partners and our technology partners.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Alex Zukin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just the Canadian government deal, can you guys remind us how that's gonna play into the fiscal 2025 guide given kind of a slightly longer ramp time. And, Jeremy, maybe just I know we're not guiding today for us recurring, but maybe help just from a modeling standpoint, how we should think about that flowing through the year, maybe relative to last year.
Jeremy Johnson: Yep. Alex, good to speak with you. Look, on the Canadian government deal, I think as Steve kind of spoke to a little bit is we're continuing to work towards those deadlines that we talked about in the most recent. Timelines, which is targeting April 2025. We're on track to achieve those milestones, and that's more on the kind of recurring side of things. On the professional services, we have been seeing, you know, work and we've doing work, and we continue to do work with the government of Canada. On the recurring side of things, I think you'll see, you know, kind of a continuous cadence there or consistent cadence with how things have looked in the past. And, you know, stop me short of giving, you know, kind of full guidance. I think that 15% to 17% constant currency number for the full year is a good guide, and we should kind of remain in those balance for the quarterly basis as well.
Alex Zukin: Got it. And then, David, maybe just I'll reask one of the earlier questions, but I think when you were when when when you've spoken last time on the earnings call, you kind of talked about a you know, just watching out for lengthening sales cycles as you go up market as those deals take more time to actually execute on, but it seems like something changed in that visibility given the December and January. So I'm just curious, is it is it the demand environment? Is it you know, something you figured out on the execution? Is it tailwinds from AI? Like, what what changed in your from your perspective, from you know, ninety days ago to now with respect to that visibility.
David Ossip: I think that the impact of Discover client conference did have an impact in terms of purchasing cycles. So I think the work that the product and technology team has done in really differentiating very clearly our Dayforce relative to the others had impact. As Steve mentioned, I think the branding work that we invested in last year is also getting us more mind share, and it's making it easier for us to get the final approvals. In the very large types of deals. So I do think that the sales team really is performing very well, and I'm very proud of the way that they go to market and the way that they tell the story and the way that they show the product as well. I think that as an organization, Dayforce and how they make it the way that we interact and partner with our customers is reflected. You can see that as well in the retention rate is now 98% on tables, which has got to be best in market. And then lastly, as I mentioned, I do think on the macro side, that there's much more optimism across business leaders about the economy and that is helping with purchasing cycles as well.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Brad Reback of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Brad Reback: Great. Thanks very much. Maybe two quick ones. Did you all mention what the percent of new sales back to the base was?
Jeremy Johnson: We haven't yet, but it was above 40%. 42% was the number this past year. And we're really pleased with that. And we also sold the same number actually, 42% of all suite deals as well.
Brad Reback: Great. And then, Jeremy, given some of the unusual puts and takes in 4Q things that snuck up on you a bit, have you taken a different guidance philosophy? Maybe increased conservatism at all as it relates to you know, 1Q in all of 2025? Thanks.
Jeremy Johnson: Yeah. Look. I think we've ultimately taken what we learned in Q4 and use that to inform our guidance for the future. I think we still kind of give tight ranges, but you can ultimately see that we're kind of giving these constant currency growth ranges and then setting down the FX rate that we're using and then trying to be really clear about the flow to some there. And know, you think about the total revenue growing 14% to 15% ex float, on a constant currency basis and Dayforce recurring revenue at 15% to 17%, and we're really pleased with those numbers and our ability to do that and while we're also expanding margins. On that adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow.
Brad Reback: That's great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. This brings us to the end of the question and answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Ossip for closing comments.
David Ossip: Great, Derek. Thanks everyone for joining us. Sorry for those of you that we didn't get to get to the actual questions today, but we'll have the one on one following. Just a few pieces I'd like to end with one again. Reiterating the sales momentum we saw in Q4 that continued into January and our confidence in sales for Q1 and for the year. The second is I want to reiterate that we're holding the revenue guide for the year while increasing the adjusted EBITDA by 100 basis points. And that we are seeing that meaningful improvement in profitability across all aspects. And lastly, we are positioning Dayforce in the midterm for the same growth. Around the current levels while moving towards that 20% plus free cash flow. Again, thank you everyone for joining us today.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's event. You may disconnect.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-30 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Dayforce third quarter 2024 earnings call. [Operator instructions]. It is now my pleasure to introduce David Niederman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
David Niederman: Thank you for joining, and welcome to the Dayforce third quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm David Niederman, Vice President, Investor Relations. As a reminder, all participants are in a listen-only mode and a question-and-answer session will follow our opening remarks. Joining me on the call today are CEO, David Ossip, and CFO Jeremy Johnson. We also have Chief Strategy, Product, and Technology Officer, Joe Korngiebel, and our President and COO, Steve Holdridge, available for Q&A. Before I hand the call over to David, I want to remind everyone that our commentary may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause Dayforce's results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as the cautionary statements in our filings. Additionally, over the course of this call, we'll reference non-GAAP Measures to describe our performance. Please review our earnings press release and filings with the SEC for our rationale behind the use of non-GAAP Measures and for a full reconciliation of these GAAP to non-GAAP metrics. These documents, in addition to a replay of this call, and also a transcript, will be available on our Dayforce investor relations website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to David.
David Ossip: Thanks, David, and thank you all for joining us. I'll provide some high-level comments on our third quarter results and turn the call to Jeremy to provide more details of our financials, sales wins and customer go lives and an updated full-year outlook. In the third quarter, we achieved strong results as we continue to focus on healthy growth combined with a focus on profitability metrics and cashflow generations. Dayforce recurring revenue of $333 million was up 19% with and without float, and total revenue of $440 million increased 17%. Cloud recurring gross margin was 79%, up 200 basis points, and adjusted cloud recurring gross margin was 79.9%, up 160 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA was $126 million, up 18%, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 28.7%, up 30 basis points. Year-to-date operating cash flow was $200 million, up 54%, and year-to-date free cash flow was $117 million, up 184%. We ended the third quarter with 6,730 customers live on the Dayforce platform, with the average Dayforce recurring revenue per customer up 15%. We believe we are well positioned to continue to win in the marketplace, with the Dayforce platform providing a competitive advantage. Our pace of innovation is faster than ever, and some examples from our most recent product release include the delivery of the new Dayforce learning, a re-platforming of our eloomi acquisition into the Dayforce platform, introduction of cashless tips into our Wallet product, and enhancement of our people analytics with introduction of Measures, align organizations to set thresholds and track performance of their people with intelligent nudges. The market opportunity remains substantial. Organizations recognize that adopting a modern and best-in-class HCM system can yield significant benefits. These benefits stem from replacing as many as 12 disparate systems with the Dayforce platform. Drilling down into our sales during the quarter, we did see instances of elongated sales. There was no specific industry or segment where this was more pronounced. However, we continued to have strong confidence in our fourth quarter guidance, underscored by our go live plans, our expanding sales motion to our existing customer base and more full-suite deals. Our Q4 pipeline remains strong, with a coverage ratio of sales opportunities to sales targets of approximately 4x. We believe the pipeline strength is a result of our key growth drivers, including the expansion of the Dayforce platform to include a broad set of HCM offerings, our move upmarket to target and win large customers, building the system integrated channel, which allows us to leverage our partners’ implementation and sales capabilities, and finally, building the foundation to win and serve global clients. Additionally, sales to our customer base continues to be a driver of growth, with add-on sales compromising approximately 37% of total bookings in the quarter, with solid growth across our Talent Intelligence suite. Looking now to the fourth quarter, we are excited to host customers at our annual Dayforce Discover event in Las Vegas in a few weeks. We also will be holding an Investor Day alongside the customer focus program. I'll now pass the call to Jeremy to discuss our natural results in more detail. Jeremy, over to you.
Jeremy Johnson: Thanks, David. We were pleased with our third quarter results. Top line revenue growth remains strong, while we scaled the business and continued to expand cashflow margins. Dayforce recurring revenue was $333.2 million, up 19.2%, or up 19.3% on a constant currency basis. And Dayforce recurring revenue, excluding float, was $292 million, up 18.9% or up 19% on a constant currency basis, underpinned by strong go lives and healthy underlying customer trends. Total revenue was $440 million, up 16.6% on a GAAP basis and 16.7% on a constant currency basis. Powerpay recurring revenue, excluding float, was $20.2 million, up 3.1% on a GAAP basis and 5.1% on a constant currency basis. And professional services and other revenue was $64.1 million, up 23% on a GAAP and on a constant currency basis. On a GAAP basis, gross profit was $201.3 million, up 25.4%. Operating profit was $20.8 million, including an incremental $7 million of amortization expense related to the retired Ceridian trade name, and a $9 million earnout expense related to the 2021 acquisition of DataFuZion. Cloud recurring gross margin was 79%, up 200 basis points. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted cloud recurring gross margin was 79.9%, up 160 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA was $126.1 million, up 17.6% or a 28.7% margin, expanding 30 basis points and reflecting our continued improvement in gross profit margins and scale in adjusted G&A. From a cash flow perspective, operating cash flows were $91.8 million, up 151%, and free cash flow was $63.4 million, up over 1000% as we continue to focus on cash flow margins. Year-to-date operating cash flow was $200.1 million, up 54.4%, and year-to-date free cash flow was $117.3 million, up 184%. Turning to Dayforce Wallet, registration rates and user transactions per month remain consistent, and Wallet revenue remains on track to more than double this year. Some notable sales wins from across the globe in Q3 included a North American hospitality company that specializes in managing and developing luxury hotels and resorts, selected the full day Dayforce suite to support 22,000 employees across the US, Mexico, and Canada. A major multi-brand Australian retailer selected Dayforce as its unified HCM solution to support their 12,000 employees across Australia and New Zealand. A global manufacturing and distribution leader operating in over 12 countries selected the full Dayforce suite to enhance the experience of 8,500 employees across US and Canada. And some key Q3 customer go lives included a British multinational hotel and restaurant company with 38,000 employees, went live across the UK with Dayforce managed Payroll, HR, workforce management and talent. A prominent US manufacturer recently went live with Dayforce HR Payroll, Time, Wallet, and document management for its 10,000 employees. And a UK fashion retailer with 400 stores and 10,000 employees recently implemented Dayforce HR, Workforce Management, Payroll, and Dayforce Wallet. You can read about more notable sales wins and customer go lives in our earnings press release. A few other callouts before I move on to guidance. As expected, eloomi revenue added approximately 170 basis points of growth to our Dayforce recurring revenue ex-float in the third quarter, while last year's movement of the tax business represented a headwind of approximately 100 basis points to the third quarter Dayforce recurring revenue ex-float. During the quarter, we executed a receivables securitization facility to optimize cash movements related to Dayforce Wallet. As part of this, we sold $30.1 million of Wallet receivables to fund Dayforce Wallet draws. And finally, we executed $30 million of our $500 million share repurchase plan and are pleased that we have the profitability and flexibility to return capital to our shareholders and to manage dilution from share-based compensation, while maintaining investment in the business. Now, turning to guidance, for the full year, we expect Dayforce recurring revenue ex-float of $1.163 billion to $1.168 billion, or growth of 21% as reported and on a constant currency basis, total revenue of $1.747 billion to $1.752 billion, or growth of 15% to 16% as reported, or 16% on a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA of $492.2 million to $507 million or 28.2% to 28.9% margin. We remain confident in our full-year cash flow targets of upper 50% conversion from full-year adjusted EBITDA to operating cash flow, and expect capital expenditures to remain steady on a dollar basis versus last year, which should result in free cash flow margin of between 9.5% and 10% of revenue. Float revenue is now expected to be $192 million for the full year. And for the fourth quarter, we expect Dayforce recurring revenue ex-float of $311 million to $316 million, or growth in the range of 21% to 23% as reported and on a constant currency basis, total revenue of $452 billion to $457 million or growth of 13% to 14% as reported, or 13% to 15% on a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA of $120 million to $135 million or a 26.5% to 29.5% margin, and float revenue of $37 million. The USD to CAD foreign exchange rates assumed in our guidance are 1.38 for Q4 or an a average of 1.37 for the full year. And to be clear, the weakening Canadian dollar continues to be a headwind for us versus the original 2024 guidance and versus last year We feel good about our growth trajectory, and for 2025 we're issuing initial guidance of total revenue growth, excluding float between 14% and 15% on a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA margin above 31%, and free cash flow margin above 12%. As David mentioned, our Investor Day is scheduled for November 12th in Las Vegas. During the day, we look forward to diving into our strategy, our product differentiation, our continued durable growth and expanding profitability and more as we lay out our path to achieving our long-term ambitions of $5 billion in revenue, $1 billion in free cash flow as a leader in the HCM space. With that, we can begin the Q&A portion of our call.
Operator: [Operator instructions]. Our first questions come from the line of Kevin Mcveigh with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.
Kevin Mcveigh: Great. Thanks so much and congratulations on the results. Hey, I wonder if you could just help us understand what gave the confidence to offer the initial 2025 guidance. I wanted to kind of start there and maybe a little bit of focus, because it looks like the free cash flow conversion continues to kind of scale. Maybe a little bit of focus on that too.
David Ossip: Hey, Kevin. Nice to hear from you and thanks for your comments. As you know, our business is highly plannable, and we go into the year with a high degree of certainty based on the percentage of recurring revenue that we have. That, tackled or combined with the go live forecast we have both in Q4 and the early part of the year, gives us a high degree of certainty. And as you've seen consistently relative to our guide, we come in very, very accurately. In terms of the free cash flow perspective, as you know, that's been a big focus. We have pivoted the company to make sure that we are on top of profitability on free cash flow. Jeremy, do you want to add anything on the free cash flow side?
Jeremy Johnson: Yes, look, I mean, I think we're highly focused on leveraging the inherent profitability of this business, and we're confident that we can achieve both the guidance metrics that we offered, which are adjusted EBITDA above 31% and the free cash flow above 12%. But it all comes down to focus and it's something that I've been working on since I got here.
Kevin Mcveigh: Great, and just real quick, it's great to see the initial buyback. Any thoughts, Jeremy, on that over the balance of this year into 2025, or David?
Jeremy Johnson: Yes, look, I mean, you saw us by about 30 million shares in the quarter. As you know, the primary purpose of our share buy buyback is to manage dilution from stock-based compensation. You'll see us probably in market continuing to do that, but ultimately we've got a lot of capacity under that and could be opportunistic in the future should the market permit it.
Kevin Mcveigh: Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird. Please proceed with your questions.
Mark Marcon: Hey, good morning. And let me add my congratulations, really strong results. Wondering if you can talk a little bit about some of the major wins that you ended up having this past quarter, and specifically who you ended up winning from, so when we take a look at this North American hospitality company or the Australian retailer. And then I'm wondering if you can also - a lot of investors ask about saturation. They ask about how much room there's left. What are you seeing just in terms of the pipeline and decision cycles? I know you mentioned decision cycles earlier, but wondering if you can talk about that as well.
David Ossip: Sure. Hi, Mark. Nice to hear from you this morning. In terms of the hospitality, it was a quite a competitive process. I believe the finals were one of the other Payroll-focused organizations and one of the ERPs that you typically would find in these types of deals. What's great over there, it is a 12:1 simplification deal where we have gone in and we were able to broaden our platform at a large enterprise deal. And as you know, we differentiate when we are focusing on organizations regardless of size, they have a high percentage of frontline workers. We're finding that the value proposition of simplifying the number of components they have in their HR stack resonates very, very well in this particular macro because it often leads to a reduction in total subscription and obviously tremendous FTE and efficiency savings. In that particular deal, I would say that our compliance lead, and again, you might have seen with Gartner for the fifth consecutive year, we're in the leadership quadrant, and they ranked us number one for compliance in that, I believe 1,000 to 2,500 employee segment, as well as the above 2,500 employee segment. And in their case, I believe they had to move because of continual compliance challenges that they were having in their organization. In terms of pipeline, as I mentioned, we entered the quarter with a 4x coverage ratio, which means for every targeted dollar of ACV, we had $4 of pipeline, which is very healthy. In terms of the deals, we did see the length of deals extend by about 25% with inside the Q3. That could be driven by a number of items. Firstly, as we are now doing mostly 12:1 simplifications, it means that there are more people that have to sign off on each of the different selections. So, no longer are we just looking at the owners of the compliance modules, but we now have to look at getting sign-off from all of the HR and talent owners as well. Second, the deals, as you know, have increased. If you look at the average stables recurring is up 15% year-over-year. And as the deal sizes goes up, obviously more sign-offs are required from a financial perspective as well. And then lastly, with the macro, I would say that organizations are being more cautious and more thorough in their selections, and that too takes more time.
Mark Marcon: Great. David, you've been through multiple cycles. Do you think as interest rates start continuing to come down across the globe and some of the election uncertainty passes, that could end up reversing a little bit and we might end up seeing some faster deal close as the year progresses?
David Ossip: Mark, I would say eventually the timelines normalize. So, something that gets delayed in one particular quarter, eventually moves into a subsequent quarter, and eventually it normalizes. So, the same deal volume comes out of the machine, if you like. In terms of the overall economy, if I look at employment numbers, they came in as expected, which is roughly about 1.5% or so, employment growth across the customer base year-over-year. And I would say that's in line with what we had thought and what we've seen consistently. If we look at the actual float balances, that was actually quite positive. We saw float balances go up by 12% year-over-year. So, although the float came down - the yield rate came down slightly, you'll see that we kind of outperformed on the float to a tune of about $5 million inside the actual quarter.
Mark Marcon: That's terrific. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Samad Samana: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe first, Jeremy, just one for you on the 2025 outlook, just as we think about the exit rate for Dayforce recurring ex-float for 2024, is that the assumption that's embedded for the 2025 Dayforce recurring ex-float outlook, or what are you assuming in that 2025 guidance for Dayforce specifically?
Jeremy Johnson: Yes. Hey, Samad, how are you doing? Look, I want to be clear. We're not providing a breakout of kind of Dayforce recurring or PS and other, or Powerpay at this point. And this is a full three months in advance of when we'd normally give guidance on this. I think we do have some pretty good insight into kind of the trajectory and we're confident in our trajectory right now. And a couple of points I would call out, one is that Dayforce recurring ex-float this year is projected to grow at 21% for the full year, but keep in mind that does include a tailwind from eloomi. So, just consider that as it'll kind of - that tailwind goes away in your estimates. I think PS and other revenue can continue to show strength with some of the larger deals we're working through. And I think Powerpay should kind of look similar to the prior years. But at this point, we've got interest rate cuts in the future. We've got foreign exchange rates, and we've got a big finish to the fourth quarter. So, we're going to hold off on giving the specific Dayforce recurring ex-float guidance at this point.
Samad Samana: Great. Appreciate that. And then David, maybe a follow-up for you. I'm sure you guys have talked a lot about AI. It was a big theme at HR Tech as well. I'm curious maybe what the early use cases that you're seeing are. Is that having any impact on the nature of decision-making? And I know you gave some good clarity on what's maybe leading to longer deal times, but is that one of the factors as companies figure out how to implement maybe that and what they're thinking about doing with your AI features? Thank you.
David Ossip: Yes, Samad, thanks for the question. On AI, we are likely the first HCM provider in market with a marketable GenAI offering. We now offer the Dayforce Co-Pilot, and the way that that works is any data that you upload into the hub - the hub is effectively the landing page of the application, which is a content management system. So, any PDF documents, Word documents, text documents, and the like, we now index and we allow the users of the application, whether they be employees, managers, executives, to ask questions that are answered from the documents that they are in the audience of. So, a typical use case could be, I could upload my employee benefits book and I could ask questions like, what is my vision copay? When are my benefits going to change? Or if I upload up my employee handbook, I could ask questions about policy and the like. We believe that that particular SKU, if you like, should allow us to go back to the base and see a list of between 5% to 7% just from that one particular monetization of that AI feature. Of course, as you know, we have AI throughout the application. We offer things like if you are creating a job requisition, that it writes a job description. If you're in talent acquisition, we do the grading of the candidates using a proprietary ML model. If you're a candidate applying, we match you to opening job requisitions based on your particular skillset. We constantly look at the work energy of individuals, and we use that as predictor of someone leaving the organization. And if you read the Gartner report, that is actually included in the compensation module that we have, which allows people to adjust the compensations based on the predictive leave, if you like, of the actual employees. And on the workforce management side, we are very strong from a perspective of now using machine learning algorithms to do the actual forecasting for labor and the like. I don't see AI as being a factor of the elongated sales cycles, but I do see our kind of differentiation in AI being noted, again, by groups like Gartner and others because it is touchable and real. I encourage you and others to come to Discover in a couple of weeks, which is our customer conference. We'll have, as I know, I call it the Joe Show, which largely is focused on AI, and he'll be showing live some very new use cases and capabilities that we have from a AI perspective, and should be very, very exciting.
Samad Samana: Great. Thank you again.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your questions.
Siti Panigrahi: Thanks for taking my question. Jeremy, looking into your Q4 guidance, could you talk about the exemptions made on that Dayforce recurring ex-float? Do you expect in terms of go live pipeline, is it more frontend or backend loaded for Q4 or any eloomi exemptions that baked into that 7% sequential growth?
David Ossip: I'll take and then hand it off to Jeremy. As you know, we've given the guide of above 21% for Q4 in terms of Dayforce recurring. That is determined based on the accounts that have already gone live. So, the go lives that we have in Q4, which we have very, very good clarity on, will obviously impact Q1 and beyond.
Jeremy Johnson: That's right. Yes. And maybe I'll just add in there, yes, the guidance, that 21% to kind of 23% there, as we've talked about, nothing's really changed there. We held the guidance from the previous quarter. It is a slight acceleration or reacceleration from the Q3, but mostly that's kind of the timing of the go live. So, our business is very predictable. That visibility that we have has maintained and I think it's clear in our guidance there.
David Ossip: Yes. Jerry, maybe just a bit of clarity on the actual guidance relative, I'll say, towards expectations. If you look at the actual numbers, which might be helpful for everyone, we beat on the total revenue side by $12 million. And we increased the fiscal year by eight. On the EBITDA side, we beat by five and we increase the full-year guys by one. Now, when we actually look at the numbers, the difference between the five and the one is $2 million of float, because as I pointed out, the float balances in the quarter were very positive in Q3, and that could have been tied to bonuses and the like. And the second is on the professional services and other, there were some timing differences to the tune of about $2 million. And so, the combination of those is the delta between the, if you like, on the adjusted EBITDA side, between the beat of five and the raise of one. So, $2 million of float and $2 million of professional services, which is really related to timing.
Siti Panigrahi: Thanks, David, for that clarification. Seems like you have good visibility. Another thing I found, David, recently you guys launched a new brand campaign. Is that more towards to position yourself more as a HR company, or could you talk about that? That was an interesting campaign.
David Ossip: It's very exciting. The branding around Dayforce reflects the business as it is today. The business today is focused on the Dayforce product, as opposed, if I go back to five years ago, six years ago, where we had more different types of products and a combination between cloud and between bureau. And as we are moving forward, and you'll see this as we go into 2025, there will be a final simplification of the business around Dayforce. And with that, you should see us being able to improve the profitability of the company as we effectively focus on the higher profitability cloud revenue, and less so on the bureau end-of-life products.
Siti Panigrahi: Great. See you in a few weeks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Scott Berg with Needham & Company. please proceed with your questions.
Scott Berg: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I’m looking forward to the Joe Show. I like the title of that. That sounds great. I have two kind of follow-ups there, David, to your last kind of answer there, and they're both on the profitability side is, if I looked at the third quarter results, you beat your float revenue by $5 million. You kind of only raised the adjusted EBITDA range. It was actually $2 million for the year from your prior guidance. I guess, are you spending some of or reinvesting some of the upside to your float that you saw in the quarter, kind of either in Q3 or Q4, or is there maybe some other expenses in the business that are popping up to not see the full-year adjusted EBITDA go by - get raised by what you beat in the third quarter?
Jeremy Johnson: Yes, look, I mean, I think we are at the point in the year where things are coming into really good focus, I think even greater than we had earlier in the year. Certainly, we're looking at investments that we can make this year into next year and drive some benefit through both on the revenue side and the profitability side. So, you certainly see us kind of pulling through some of those investments and trying to make some tough decisions here. And that's the trade-off that we come to every fourth quarter. And I think we're - I guess I'd maybe point out the fact that excluding float, our Q3 adjusted EBITDA expanded by almost 300 basis points, and throughout the year you should see that be on a full-year basis, 100 to 200 basis points is kind of what our guidance implies both with and without float. So, some pretty solid margin expansion there that obviously you see going through to the cash flow statement as well.
Scott Berg: Yes, that actually brings me to your fiscal 2025 guidance on the adjust EBIT side, which I think is quite positive, greater than 31%, even with the expectation that float is probably a headwind into next year. Do we think about, or should we think about those operational efficiencies coming from anything different than what you saw here in 2024? Or is there maybe some difference in how you are, I guess, managing the business next year to drive what's theoretically in the core business more than a 200-basis point expansion in profitability?
Jeremy Johnson: Yes, it's a focus on efficiency and productivity. So, the reality is it's not coming from anywhere different than what you've seen. You're seeing us - you're going to see us likely continue to improve the recurring gross margins. You'll see us to continue to scale some of our adjusted G&A. We're going to focus on efficiency in the sales and marketing. Obviously, this year was an investment year and next year will be the kind of driving productivity out of those investments. So, no real differences, but it's a focus the business around a productivity and margin and cashflow expansion.
Scott Berg: Great. Congrats on the quarter. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line and of Bhavin Shah with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.
Bhavin Shah: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just kind of focus on the add-on bookings. It kind of remains healthy, but it looks like at 37%, a tick-down touch from last quarter. Kind of any sense of what the drivers of this were? Was this kind of a result of the elongation in sales cycles or any kind of changes in what competitors are doing? And kind of how should we think about this part of the business going forward?
David Ossip: It's a very positive number. Remember, last quarter we had the GC, the government of Canada included in the add-ons. And as we mentioned last quarter, the target for this year would be between 35% and 40%. So, it’s right we would like it to see. When we look at full suite deals in the quarter, there were 51%. So, about 46% of our customer base now have suite deals, which is at 12:1 simplification use of the actual product. As we go towards next year and longer, we would expect to see the client base sales on a long-term basis move to more of a 50% number, but it’s a very positive trend. And if I look at the year-over-year growth in terms of client base sales, it’s up just tremendously.
Bhavin Shah: That's helpful there. And just one quick follow-up for Jeremy. I know you don't want to give too much on next year's kind of initial outlook, but any high-level thoughts on how we should think about float should kind of the yield modestly tick down given your ladder portfolio or any other ways to think about it?
Jeremy Johnson: Yes, it's one of the areas where I kind of want to wait another quarter before we give guidance on float. I think we should expect to see balances continue to grow, as we have in the past, and there's no real difference in that. You'll see that kind of continue to increase on the average balance side of things. But the rate’s going to come down with the rate cuts, both in the US and Canada. We just don't know how much right now. Our laddering strategy helps quite a bit. For example, you saw some of the rate cuts this last quarter, and our average yield went from 4.1 to four. So, it's a pretty, I think, durable anyways yield that you'll see on that one, but I just don't want to give the guidance and we'll wait on one more quarter to see where we think the different central banks are going to go.
David Ossip: One thing just from a modeling perspective, at the moment we would say that there's probably about a $25 million to $30 million headwind in terms of float next year. And even with that, as you know, we've taken up the EBITDA forecast for next year above the 30% that we previously had spoken about. And so, we're looking at very healthy adjusted EBITDA growth and free cash flow growth, even with the headwind of float.
Bhavin Shah: That makes sense. Thanks for taking my questions, and congrats again.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Steve Enders with Citi. Please proceed with your questions.
Steve Enders: Okay, great. Thanks for taking the questions this morning. I guess maybe would like to stick on the 2025 guide and the outlook there, and I guess it would be great to kind of hear kind of what the underlying assumptions are, kind of the thinking around what we should be expecting in terms of labor rates or deal cycles or kind of what you're accounting for in this preliminary outlook here.
Jeremy Johnson: Yes. Similar to how I answered an earlier question here, the guidance is that revenue, excluding float, on a constant currency basis, is going to grow 14% to 15%. And that's going to flow down through adjusted EBITDA at a pretty solid above 31% margin and then into cash flows. And if you think about the breakout there, I don't really want to provide that breakout between recurring and Powerpay and PS and other at this point. We have pretty good visibility, but we've got the largest sales quarter ahead of us. And we've also got - I think Canadian exchange rates are probably the worst spot that I've seen them in, in a few years, and we want to see what happens there. And obviously, as I just mentioned, on the interest rate side of things, see where the central banks go to provide a little bit more focus on that. But we're trying to say, look, I think we feel really confident going into next year, and that's both on the top line and on the profitability side of things.
Steve Enders: All right, that's helpful context there. And I guess I want to ask on the partner side, some of those dynamics. I know it's been a big investment and focus area, but how are you kind of feeling about how that's resonating and kind of maybe what they're bringing to the table, if there's been any change in that in the past quarter or so?
David Ossip: It’s still very positive. If you come to Discover, you'll see the number of sponsorships that we have across the system integrators and other partners. You'll see the attendance level by the actual partners at the conference as well. We continue to leverage the partners, both from a perspective of helping us on the sales side, as well as helping us on the implementation side.
Steve Enders: Okay, perfect. Thanks. Taking the questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions.
Brad Reback: Great. Thanks very much. Jeremy, understanding that it's still early on 2025, maybe just from a high level, the assumptions that have gone in to inform what you've told us today, do you assume that the elongated sales cycles continue and that employment levels are flat in those numbers? Thanks.
Jeremy Johnson: Yes, we would've assumed that employment levels kind of remain where they are right now. And I think on the elongated sales cycles, look, we're still really confident in providing us a pretty solid Q4. We've had a really good year-to-date. And I think the commentary on sales is really to try and give you a little bit of context into what we're seeing in the demand environment right now, which I would look at as kind of unchanged from what we've talked about in the past. I hope that helps provide a little bit of context.
Brad Reback: It does. Thank you. And then, David, real quick, any commentary on the first month of the quarter?
David Ossip: On the first month of the quarter, we haven't closed it as of yet, but if I look at it, I think Sam is on target for hitting his first month of the quarter, which actually will be up quite nicely a year-over-year. On a monthly basis, Q4 always is skewed towards the December, and in fact, the last two weeks of December probably are what determines the particular quarter. It's also our largest quarter, and as I mentioned, we entered the quarter with about a 4x coverage ratio. So, it comes down to really execution across the actual deals.
Brad Reback: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Daniel Jester with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.
Daniel Jester: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just one on the Wallet. 1,290 live customers, I think that's up 20 customers sequentially, and it looks like you're in about 20% of the customer base live today. I think in the past, you've talked about that many, many of your customers would be potential Wallet customers, but we have seen a slowdown in those go lives. So, any sort of updated thoughts about the Wallet and its potential growth opportunity as we think about it into next year and beyond? Thanks.
David Ossip: This year has been a very strong year for growth of the actual Wallet. As you know, last year, our Dayforce revenue on the Wallet was about $12.5 million. We’ll exit this year above $30 million, and we'll probably go into next year with ARR somewhere in the 40s. So, it’s been quite a successful year for Wallet. We've spent obviously a lot of time this year in bringing out new features that help with the monetization and the use of the Wallet. Recently, we just launched a savings and goals, and we've seen quite nice adoption of that feature, probably over $1 million a across the users that are using the savings and goals that put it into those particular types of accounts on the actual Wallet. This year, again, a reminder, we launched AFT and IFT, which has been very, very nice. Another other new feature we just released are cashless tips on the Wallet. So, if you are in hospitality, you have the ability now to pay your tips through the Dayforce Wallet on a gross basis, which is very, very useful for restaurants. In November, we'll be releasing the BYOC, which allows users of the Wallet to use existing debit cards that they have. And we believe that also help with monetization as well and should help lift the revenue as we go into next year. So, it’s very, very exciting, I would say, in terms of the actual growth on that particular type of product.
Daniel Jester: Great. Thank you. And then just a quick one for Jeremy on 2025 free cash flow. I think in the past, you mentioned that there's going to be a pension settlement that you need to make, and that's embedded in the 2025 numbers. Can you just remind us any sort of clarity about the sizing of that and any updates there? Thank you.
Jeremy Johnson: Yes, thanks for the question. Yes, that would be included in our guidance. The pension termination is underway and the timing of the payments would likely be in the kind of third or fourth quarter timeframe, $20 million to $25 million. And again, that would be included in our operating cash flow and free cash flow next year.
Daniel Jester: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.
Jason Celino: Hey, thanks for having me. It's good to be on. Jeremy, I'm not going to ask you to break down the 2025 guide further, but at a high level, by giving this framework earlier than you usually do, should we be viewing it as more conservative than usual?
Jeremy Johnson: Thanks for the question. Look, I wouldn't call it more conservative than usual. I think I would call it just kind of less focus than we have at a February timeframe when we normally give this. So, we just don't have that aperture that I would like to have at this point, which is why we're not giving the same exact guidance that we always would, which is Dayforce recurring total revenue and the adjusted EBITDA. I think some of the things that you can - that we have to get focus on in our models is break the difference between Dayforce recurring and PS and other, and I think ultimately you should look at this as us feeling confident in the business to give this guidance that's early enough in the cycle.
David Ossip: Jason, one of the reasons we have given guidance or preliminary guidance for 2025 is to make sure that the market understands the focus on profitability. As you would expect, as we have - I would argue we now are a scaled company. And so, we will have much more focus in terms of profitability. As you know, this year in terms of adjusted EBITDA or free cash flow, the growth, I would argue, has been quite tremendous. And as we go into 2025, we'll keep that same focus, which will be a nice lift in the adjusted EBITDA number. We have previously spoken about a 30% next year. So, we've taken that up by 100 basis points at this particular point in time. And then on a free cash flow perspective, you'll see continued expansion of operating cash flow and free cash flow next year. Now, this ties to really the simplification of the overall product of the overall company as we've moved from a company of having several bureau-type of products to now having Dayforce and Powerpay, our two cloud products in focus. And both of those are, we should be able to continue improving the gross margin on recurring. We're very confident we'll hit that 80% plus in the cloud recurring gross margin, and we now already setting that target up significantly on a go-forward basis.
Jason Celino: Excellent. Great. Thanks for those signals. And then maybe just to follow-up, David, the 4x pipeline coverage you gave, very healthy and definitely within that rule of thumb that you want to see sophomore pipelines at, but curious how this has trended this year over time, especially as you've expanded with the channel and the launch of the partner exchange. Thanks.
David Ossip: The pipeline this year is a better qualified pipeline as well. So, the revenue operations under Sam’s team has done a very, very good job of really building up a pipeline and qualifying so that it is very clean. What's nice in the pipeline is there's a healthy percentage of back to the base opportunities over there. And that comes from the work that Joe and his team has done in terms of building out very robust HR and talent capabilities, which really allow us to go back to the base and to actually sell more. From a pricing perspective, we've also done a lot of work on packaging and simplification around that. The way that you can really think about is, if we sell the compliance modules Payroll, ben, and Time, at say just to, as an example, about 1,000 employee level, you'll be expecting a price range probably around $12. When we add talent modules, we effectively more than double that. And finally, we have the managed services offering, which has proven to be also a very good driver of growth for the client base and for net new customers. And remember, for managed services, our margins are very similar to that of cloud, and that adds another probably about $10 to $12 on top of that. As you know, from a growth perspective, it's important that we continually expand the platform. The AI components, the Co-Pilot, as we kind of discussed a bit earlier, is an example. The Co-Pilot will add about 67% of white space across the client base, which obviously allows us to continue growing the revenue from the 6,700 or so live customers we have on Dayforce.
Jason Celino: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.
Raimo Lenschow: Perfect. Thank you. Can you talk what you're seeing in the partner channel at the moment? Like, that was one of the big focus areas for you as well to engage more partners. We see now, like Capgemini just cut their revenue out last quarter, or last night. How do you see them building out and engaging with you guys? What's the progress there? Thank you.
David Ossip: Steve can answer. I don't know if we have a SI agreement with Capgemini. I don't think so.
Steve Holdridge: No.
Raimo Lenschow: I meant more as an example. Yes, sorry.
David Ossip: Ah, okay, thanks. It’s going quite nicely. In fact, recently, we signed an agreement with another one of, I'll say the top four or five, four - top four global SIs in the world, which has taken a bit of time to actually get through the paperwork, but we finally got through that. So, we continue to see strong growth across the SI channels. Again, if you come to Discover, I believe it is on the 11th to the 14th of November, the sponsorship that we have now from the SI channels and their attendance and the customers they bring to these types of events and refer to us, is really healthy.
Raimo Lenschow: Yes. Okay, perfect. And then the thing that I think I get the most question from investors is that they're a little bit confused, obviously if you give guidance or talk about a quarter, you kind of think about every word because we are going to dissect it. So, on one hand, you have really good pipeline coverage, macro hasn't changed, but you still started talking about elongation a little bit. Like, is that - but in a way we are kind of like quite a few quarters into a macro situation, into macro not being ideal. Like, so are we kind of overreading into that? Or like, how should we think about that, you talking about that for the first time?
David Ossip: Raimo, I've always thought about the business in kind of a half-year basis. The quarters often are impacted as to when the quarter ends relative to vacations and the like. So, when I look at the second half of the year, I can't say that I'm seeing any differences than what I've seen beforehand. And if I look at the first half of the year, I can't say that I've seen any differences. You see the same in terms of go lives as well, that it really is more of a half-year basis as opposed to a three-month basis. So, I wouldn't read too much into it. But as we have gone more upmarket and as we are selling a broader suite, again 51% of the customers are buying suite deals, which means more than just pay in time and core HR, so the talent modules, these deals do take longer because of the number of people that we have to speak to, and the customers often have to look at their existing contracts with now more vendors and work out how to terminate those as they kind of move to Dayforce. So, I wouldn't read more than that into it. In the second half of the year, we are very weighted towards December. It's when most of our customers look at buying and completing the actual contracts. This year, it'll be a volume type of deal. So, there's a tremendous number of opportunities that we have to get through, and we have to make sure we can execute across all the different sales steps that you would expect that are required to finalize those agreements.
Raimo Lenschow: Okay, perfect. Thank you. That's clear.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions.
Alex Zukin: Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in. Maybe just to Raimo’s question, is this a - the commentary about the sales cycle elongation, again, David, it sounds like that's more of a idiosyncratic issue because you're moving upmarket rather than a broad-based kind of comment on the general demand environment, which you're talking about isn't changing. But I guess given the narrowing of the Q4 Dayforce guide from I think 21 to 21.5 to 21, is it - did it also push out some implementations from Q4 to Q1? Or how do we think about like the very specific impacts of that?
David Ossip: So, Alex, we kept the guide consistent for Q4, and as we mentioned last quarter, we have tremendous visibility into a quarter out, if not a year out. In terms of go lives, they came in on plan at the end of Q3, as you would expect. In terms of the elongation, there are a number of aspects, as I've mentioned. One is, we have gone upmarket and larger deals take more time. There obviously are more global deals in there as well, which also take longer to actually finalize. We have more suite deals which require more people to sign off inside the actual organizations. And then as I did mention, on the macro side, we are seeing organizations be much more diligent in the actual contracting and sign-off process. So, it’s a combination, I would say, of all four of those. On the positive, we are seeing evidence of the deal sizes growing, as you see with the Dayforce recurring - a lift across the client base of the average size of a Dayforce recurring customer has gone up 15% year-over-year. I would say that the client base sales motion that we put in place just this year is working very, very well, with very healthy year-over-year improvements. And as we mentioned, in the quarter it came in at about 37% of sales, which again, is very consistent with the guide that we gave even at the beginning of the year, which again talks about the predictability of the business. In terms of 2025, what would be true to say is as an organization, we are more focused on profitability and free cash flow, and that comes with the simplification of the business as we focus on the better revenue streams and products of the business, which are Dayforce and Powerpay. And as we do that, you will see a period of time where it flows very nicely to the actual bottom line. And I think the outlook that Jeremy gave is consistent with Street expectations with a increase in the probability next year, which we felt was important that we get out there.
Alex Zukin: Perfect. And then maybe just a clarifying question. You mentioned for next year, float would be a $25 million to $30 million headwind. I'm assuming that means it grew $25 million to $30 million this year. It'd be probably flatter for next year, not it's going down by $25 million or $30 million.
David Ossip: That's correct. If you look at last year, the yield was about 3.7%. The yield for this year will likely be about 4% to 4.1%. We have seen nice growth in terms of the balances. If I look at the balances for the particular quarter, we were up 12.4% year-over-year. For next year, I would expect that the yield will be at the most equal to what we had last year, which again, was about 3.7%. And if you do the math on that, that creates a headwind of about $25 million or so.
Alex Zukin: Okay, great. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our final questions will come from the line of Mark Murphy with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your questions.
Mark Murphy: Thank you. Thank you for squeezing me in, as Alex said. David, just regarding the elongated sales that you experienced in Q3, and given your comments about the month of October, I guess it's the month of October through the 30th being up year-over-year, do you expect you'll be able to catch up with your fiscal year plan from a booking standpoint? And then also to the extent that - I think you're saying the elongation is tied to larger, more complex deals, which seems logical. Can you confirm that smaller, less complicated deals did not experience that type of elongation in sales cycles?
David Ossip: As I mentioned on the call, Mark, we didn't see any one segment stand out. Remember, we don't sell in the small business. So, the majority of our deals that we sell are above 1,000 employees. And in the major markets, which goes up to 3,500 employees, we are selling mostly full suite deals, which have the 12 different components that we're replacing. To the first part of your actual question, the quarter is very dependent on the month of December much more so than in other quarters in the year where you get more of a even linearity between the different months. Q4 is more weightage. Above 50% would always be in the month of December. If I look at it at the moment from a pipeline coverage basis, it’s very healthy, whether I look at a gross coverage basis or I look at a weighted coverage basis. So, that's when you tie in the probability side. We're above the ACV target. So, it it'll come down to the month of December. But there is a lot of activity. If I look at other indicators, attendance at the summits, at the Discover Customer Conference, up significantly year-over-year. So, there's a lot of activity that's going. And when I look at the work that I think Sam's doing, I think that we've seen really good productivity increases in the sales group.
Mark Murphy: Thank you for that, David. As a quick follow-up I'm, I'm curious, how are you assessing the willingness to pay for AI-based whether it's co-pilots or agents in the realm of HR? And the reason that I ask is, the monetization seems to be moving fastest in the areas like developers with code generators and customer service contact centers, sales and marketing workloads, it seems to be building and monetizing well. I heard your comment about some uplift as you get into it, but I think investors are just trying to understand, is the perceived value and willingness to pay on par when it comes to HR managers or Payroll managers when we can contrast it to some of these other areas.
David Ossip: Mark, I think where you've actually kind of focused are where GenAI was first used. So, the first use cases you saw coming out of really some of the development tools that Microsoft put in place, so they've been in market longer. I think you're now moving into a phase where you've seen AI being added to other use cases across the enterprise stack. We are, I believe, first in market with the Co-Pilot for the GenAI offering. And remember this, we don't charge for things like the writing of the job descriptions in talent acquisition. Rather, this is a separate product that we now have on the actual price sheet. It's a separate SKU where we can go back to customers, and it is a great product you see. In fact, you'll see me show it at Discover, and when customers see it, there a tremendous amount of excitement. And remember, for us, we're always focused on how do we deliver value to the customer, whether it's a 12:1 simplification where we can reduce subscription fees and reduce FTEs around the management of the HCM stack. In terms of Co-Pilot, we're reducing the number of inbound calls to the HR teams by being able to answer the questions through a GenAI conversation. And at the same time, we're delivering tremendous value to the users of the application in really lifting up their experience on how they interact and get data about the organization, about policies about themselves, or their frontline managers or executives, how they get information about their teams and performance of their organization.
Mark Murphy: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to hand the call back over to David Ossip for closing remarks.
David Ossip: Thank you very much and thank you all for attending. We're excited to see many of you at our Investor Day at Discover, and I'm hoping that many of you do attend Discover as well. Again, the product that will be shown I think will be very, very exciting, and I'm looking for just a wonderful experience for everyone as we enhance the community around the Dayforce platform.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-31 08:00:00) =====
David Niederman: [Abrupt Start]. Joining me on the call today are CEO, David Ossip; and CFO, Jeremy Johnson. We also have Chief Product and Technology Officer; Joe Korngiebel; and our President, Steve Holdridge available for Q&A. Before I hand the call over to David, I want to remind everyone that our commentary may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause Dayforce's results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission such as the cautionary statements in our filings. Additionally over the course of this call, we'll reference non-GAAP measures to describe our performance. Please review our earnings press release and filings with the SEC for our rationale behind the use of non-GAAP measures and for a full reconciliation of these GAAP to non-GAAP metrics. These documents in addition to a replay of this call will be available on the Dayforce's Investor Relations website. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to David.
David Ossip: Thanks, David, and thank you all for joining us. I will provide some high-level comments on our second quarter and then turn the call to Jeremy to provide more details of our financials and an updated full year outlook. In the second quarter, we delivered strong results. Revenue growth was healthy as Dayforce continues to exhibit strong appeal with customers to power best-in-class HCM experiences for their employees. Dayforce recurring revenue of $322 million was up 20% including float, and 21% excluding float on a constant currency basis. And total revenue of $423 million increased 16%. Cloud recurring gross margin was 77.7%, up 100 basis points, adjusted EBITDA was $116 million up 18%, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.5%, up 60 basis points. And free cash flow was $72.7 million in Q2, up 36%. Our business momentum remained strong in the second quarter with significant progress achieved across our product and operations and deal momentum continuing at an encouraging pace. While the macro backdrop remains fluid, we have been able to pivot to industries where Dayforce enjoys their traction including manufacturing, retail and hospitality among others. Looking out to the second half of the year. We are encouraged by our achievements to date in 2024. The core value proposition of the Dayforce platform of creating simplicity at scale, reducing complexity, driving financial ROI and improving employee engagement resonates very well with customers. The HCM market is very large and is expanding. This continues to be a resilient and durable market of growth and our pipeline strength continued through the second quarter. We are optimistic this momentum will persist through the second half as conversations with prospective customers for the full suite platform are progressing well in all segments and regions. Turning to customers and market highlights. In Q2, we delivered balanced and consistent growth across customer acquisition, activation, expansion and retention. Our momentum sustained for sales, kickoffs and go live. We ended the quarter with Dayforce recurring revenue per customer up 18%. We now have 6,657 customers live on the Dayforce platform. From a sales perspective, we saw strong demand for Dayforce globally and sustained strength in both enterprise and major markets on a year-over-year basis. Year-to-date SI-led momentum continued with healthy year-over-year growth underscoring our success in expanding our partner ecosystem. Customers continue to see the power and capability of the Dayforce platform with full suite attach rates coming in at over 50% of new sales bookings and sales to our customer base contributed positively to growth with add-on sales compromising more than 50% of total bookings including add-on sales to the Canadian government and solid growth in our talent intelligence suite. Dayforce remains differentiated from our peer group as the all-in-one global people platform that delivers simplicity at scale with a full HCM suite, a single application on a single database powered by AI. Our differentiation is evidenced by our strong win rates best-in-class revenue retention and healthy sales growth. Turning to Dayforce Wallet. We were pleased to hit the milestone in early July of $4 billion loaded cumulatively. We had nearly 1,300 customers live as of June 30 and registration rates and use of transactions per month, remain constant. Wallet revenue is expected to more than double this year and is the fastest-growing product at Dayforce. The payroll modernization project for the government of Canada is progressing well. As you may have seen, the Canadian government provided an update earlier this month with information about their targets, time lines and planned investments. Dayforce is proud to play a part in this project to help the government of Canada not only pay its workers accurately and on time, but to provide a modern employee engagement and talent platform as well. Jeremy will provide some color as to the impact from this project to our financial forecast. In addition to the Government of Canada, some other notable sales wins from across the globe in Q2 included a global agri business and food company with more than 20,000 employees selected Dayforce managed payroll and benefits Workforce Management Wallet and Dayforce industry solutions for its 5,000 US and Canadian employees. A family of independent hospitality brands based in the UK with more than 20,000 employees selected the full Dayforce suite to be used across its employee population in the UK and Ireland. A multinational entertainment company selected Dayforce pay on time for its 9,000 US and Canadian employees. And some key Q2 customer go-lives included a multinational government consulting firm that is now live on Dayforce Payroll HR and time for all 39,000 employees in the US, UK, Canada, Netherlands, Germany, Singapore and Saudi Arabia. A global e-commerce company with over 7,000 employees has gone live on Dayforce Payroll and Workforce Management for its US population. A UK seller of new and used cars went live with the full Dayforce platform to 6,000 employees and a US regional airline that flies into more than 100 cities across North America, implemented the full Dayforce suite for its 5,000 employees. You can read about more notable sales wins and customer go lives in our earnings press release. Turning now to some updates on our platform and technology. As always our goal is to deliver simplicity at scale and allow our customers to eliminate the complexity that often results from combining multiple legacy HCM solutions. This principle guides our innovation even as we introduce new capabilities to help our customers navigate the ever-evolving landscape of work and technology. In the second quarter, we introduced several exciting innovations. We launched Dayforce Flex Work, an on-demand marketplace that helps organizations augment their workforce by posting ships and selecting from a core of gig-retired seasonal and alumni workers. Flex Work manages background checks, onboarding and payroll, helping to give employers peace of mind, while giving frontline workers a more flexible working experience. We launched Dayforce Skills Engine, which uses AI to help identify skills, gaps, then source and upscale talent with end customer workforces. We launched on-the-job learning checklist on the Dayforce platform, which will allow managers to document trading and observe the impact on performance. We launched Dayforce Payroll in Singapore, enabling customers operating in the region across Asia to access Dayforce industry-leading payroll capabilities. We recently introduced the Dayforce Partner Exchange, which is a marketplace where customers can connect with fully vetted Dayforce partners and discover software and services that extend the platform with access to over 120 software and SI partners. And we remain committed to helping our customers adhere to their compliance requirements with more than 200 compliance updates released in the first half of 2024. This pace of innovation is truly impressive and we have an extensive road map for future enhancements and products that we are excited to provide our customers. Finally, due to our continued strong results, profitability improvements, and cash flow generation, we announced that our Board of Directors has approved a $500 million share repurchase program and we announced our first ever Investor Day on November 12th in Las Vegas, alongside our Dayforce Discover Conference, where we plan to present a comprehensive view of our vision, strategy, and multiyear financial model. We look forward to seeing many of you in person there. In summary, we continued our momentum in the second quarter and are confident in the growth opportunity in the second half of the year. I'd like to thank everyone in our Dayforce community, including our customers, partners, and our team of passionate daymakers. I'll now pass the call to Jeremy to discuss our financial results in more detail. Jeremy, over to you.
Jeremy Johnson: Thanks David. We were pleased with our second quarter results. Top line growth continued to perform and we experienced enhancement to margins, allowing us to drive strong adjusted EBITDA and generate cash flow improvement. Dayforce recurring revenue was $321.6 million, up 19.9% and Dayforce recurring revenue excluding float was $277.7 million, up 20.1% or up 20.5% on a constant currency basis, underpinned by strong go-lives and healthy underlying customer trends. Total revenue was $423.3 million, up 15.7% on a GAAP basis and 16.3% on a constant currency basis. Powerpay recurring revenue was $24.6 million, growing 2.1% on a GAAP basis and 3.7% on a constant currency basis. On a GAAP basis, gross profit was $186.8 million, up 19.8% and operating profit was $14.1 million, including $20.9 million of amortization expense related to the retired Ceridian trade name, which was not in the Q2 2023 comparison financials. Cloud recurring gross margin was 77.7%, up 100 basis points. And excluding float, our cloud recurring gross margin also continued to expand nicely improving by 120 basis points. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted cloud recurring gross margin was 78.8%, up 70 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA was $116.3 million, up 18% or a 27.5% margin expanding 60 basis points and reflecting our continued improvement in gross profit margins and scale in adjusted G&A. From a cash flow perspective, operating cash flows were $99.2 million, up 21% and free cash flow was $72.7 million, up 36%. I'd like to formally introduce a new financial metrics that we'll begin to speak about more frequently and that's free cash flow. In our SEC filings, we've included a very simple reconciliation from operating cash flow to free cash flow, simply reducing operating cash by capital expenditures. We view free cash flow as a metric that displays cash profitability on a consistent basis when viewed over time. Expanding free cash flow margin is a target for us in the long term, enabled by our continued growth and focus on increasing profitability and improvements in cash conversion from EBITDA. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $53.9 million, up 48% and we remain confident in our full year cash flow targets of upper 50% conversion from adjusted EBITDA to operating cash flow and expect capital expenditures to remain steady on a dollar basis versus last year. As expected, Eloomi revenue added approximately 200 basis points of growth to our Dayforce recurring revenue ex float in the quarter, while last year's movement of the tax business represented a headwind of approximately 100 basis points to second quarter Dayforce recurring revenue ex float. A few other call-outs before I move on to our guidance. First, at the end of June, we performed an approximately 1% reduction in workforce, which is included in the $10.5 million in restructuring expense adjusted out of EBITDA. This reduction was planned when we entered the year and was primarily a result of optimizations and spans of control and layers of employment levels inside each of our functions. We believe these changes will set Dayforce up on a more solid foundation to continue to build our global operating model and drive efficiencies in our business. Second, we added disclosure to our 10-Q and earnings release to provide additional color on accounts receivable. This incremental detail includes historical breakout by quarter of accounts receivable components, including trade AR, receivables from wallet amounts outstanding and amounts due from float income and other bank interest paid in arrears. This was previously disclosed on the annually, but we believe it is helpful to provide investors quarterly. And finally, I want to provide more clarity around the financial details of the payroll modernization project with the government of Canada. If you recall in April, the government announced that they had allocated CAD 135 million in the 2024, '25 budget to explore a new HR and pay solution. Included in that allocation is now formally a contract for CAD 85 million or approximately US$62 million to amend the contract with Dayforce to include additional talent capabilities, provide incremental licenses and to continue to expand testing and design Dayforce to its specific needs. This contract included about 1/4 of the funds for software which we begin to -- we expect to begin realizing in the second quarter of 2025. And the remainder of the funds for services to be delivered by both Dayforce and our services partners, which we expect to deliver throughout 2024 and 2025. These services bookings are more of a continuation of the work we've been doing on this project and are already contemplated as part of guidance. Now turning to our guidance for the full year. We expect Dayforce recurring revenue ex float of $1.163 billion to $1.168 billion, or a growth of 21% as reported and 21% to 21.5% on a constant currency basis. Total revenue of $1.736 billion to $1.746 billion, a growth of 15% as reported or 15% to 16% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA of $490 million to $505 million or 28.2% to 28.9% margin. Float revenue is now expected to be $187 million for the full year. And for the third quarter, we expect Dayforce recurring revenue ex-float of $289 million to $294 million, or growth in the range of 18% to 20% as reported and on a constant currency basis [Technical Difficulty] adjusted EBITDA of $115 million to $125 million or 27.1% to a 29.1% margin and float revenue is expected to be $40 million for the third quarter. Our guidance implies fourth quarter Dayforce recurring revenue excluding float growing at approximately 23% on a constant currency basis. With fluctuating growth rates between our quarters driven primarily by the timing of go-lives and various other revenue drivers differing between this year and last year. The USD to Canadian foreign exchange rates assumed in our guidance are $1.38 for Q3 and Q4, or an average of $1.37 for the full year. To be clear the weakening Canadian dollar continues to be a headwind for us, which we are accounting for in our maintained or raised guidance ranges for the full year. I'd like to thank you for your interest in Dayforce. We are excited to continue executing against our opportunity in the third quarter and the remainder of 2024. With that, we can begin the Q&A portion of our call.
David Ossip : Hey, Jeremy, thank you for that. Before I ask Dave to moderate the Q&A, one item possibly since you ended off on FX, could you provide some impact as to the headwinds of FX this year and how we rate that into our guidance?
Jeremy Johnson : Yes. Thanks David. It's a good point. For total revenue, we started the year with total revenue guidance of $1.72 billion to $1.73 billion and we raised our guidance since then by $16 million to our current guidance ranges. Now to get here we beat our guidance in the first quarter by $4.5 million in our guidance in the second quarter by $4.3 million for a total of about $9 million. And we've also raised the rest of the year by another $7 million to get to that total $16 million. But our original guidance contemplated US$1.33 Canadian FX rates, while the Canadian dollar has actually weakened to about 1.38 at a spot rate today. And because of that we've also absorbed almost $13 million of FX headwinds versus our original guidance assumption to total revenue. So in essence we've increased our revenue guidance by $29 million from our original guide in February but have had to absorb $13 million in FX headwind. Now this happens in Dayforce recurring revenue ex float as well. We started the year with guidance of $1.16 billion to $1.165 billion. We raised our guidance by $3 million. We beat first quarter by $3 million as well. But due to the weakening Canadian dollar, we've had to absorb almost $7 million of FX headwinds. So in essence we've increased our Dayforce recurring revenue ex-flow guidance by about $10 million, but have had to absorb that $7 million FX headwind. And with regard to adjusted EBITDA, we started the year with guidance of $480 million to $495 million and we've raised our guidance by $10 million to get to our current guidance ranges. And to get here we beat our first quarter by $4 million, our second quarter by $3 million and we raised the rest of the year by $3 million. And now FX has had an impact on adjusted EBITDA although it's somewhat muted due to our offsetting expenses in Canada, but there has been a headwind of approximately $4 million versus our original guidance ranges. So in essence we've increased our adjusted EBITDA by $14 million, but with a $4 million FX headwind. So the weakening Canadian dollar since the beginning of the year is having an outsized impact on our results, but we continue to execute well with these headwinds. Maybe David, do you need or want to go ahead and open up to the first question?
A - David Niederman: Yes. Great. So thanks everyone for joining. Our first question is going to come from Mark Marcon from Baird. Mark, please unmute yourself and go ahead.
Mark Marcon: Hey, good morning and thanks for taking the questions. And congratulations on the solid results particularly encouraging to see the free cash flow as well as the progress on the Canadian government. A couple of observations and a question. Your margins are increasing nicely. And then when we take a look at the business highlights and the sales highlights a lot of the wins are global companies or international companies. I'm wondering if you can just talk a little bit about from a longer-term perspective how we should think about the profitability of the international opportunities relative to North American opportunities?
David Ossip: Mark, thanks very much for that question. And also thank you for highlighting the fact that we've been quite successful on a global basis. As you know this is part of our durable growth strategy. And it's allowed us to be successful this year by quite honestly pivotal into markets where we've still seen robust to purchase it. In terms of overall profitability, our probability as you know is driven by density of features that our customers are buying. We pointed out that about 50% of the new sales are full suite products and we've also had very successful sales back to the base. If you see the NRRs included. When we go back to the base we add obviously additional revenue without really changing the cost basis from support or from a hosting perspective. So a lot of it flows directly down to the bottom-line. The same is true on a global basis. In terms of comparison between global customers and North American customers we would expect to see the same margins on a global basis. Obviously, our sales and marketing costs and some of our P&T costs as we enter new geos would be slightly higher. But as those products reach maturity you will see those normalize as well.
Mark Marcon: That's great. And then -- thanks for the additional color with regards to the Canadian government project. Obviously, things are going well there. Jeremy you highlighted that by the time we get to the second quarter of 2025 we might see some software revenue come through to a greater extent. Is there anything else that you can tell us with regards to the magnitude of the size and how we should think about layering that in as we think about 2025 and going into 2026.
Jeremy Johnson: Yes. Look, I think first and foremost we're excited about continuing to build that partnership with the Government of Canada and help them modernize their payroll. As I said on the call, specifically, we signed a contract for about US$60 million with the government of Canada to expand testing and design to their specific needs about a-quarter of that was for software subscription beginning what we expect to be assuming we can execute which we have confidence in April of 2025. So the remainder of that would be for professional services work. That's more ongoing type work that we have been continuing to do with the government across both us and our partners already largely contemplated in our guidance, but we'll continue throughout that term as well.
Mark Marcon: Great. Thank you very much. And congrats.
Operator: Our next question will come from Samad Samana from Jefferies.
Samad Samana: Hi. Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. I'll echo Mark's comments is a great quarter. Maybe first Jeremy for you. Just as I think about the guidance for 3Q and 4Q the implied ramp in the fourth quarter is really impressive, right? It implies growth accelerating against the tougher comp it would be one of the bigger kind of dollar adds that you've had in the fourth quarter in several years. So, just can you help us understand what's underpinning the confidence in that ramp? And how much visibility you have into that? And is it any particular large deals that are supposed to go live? Or is it just the natural cadence of the business?
Jeremy Johnson: Yeah. Thanks Samad. It's good to hear from you. Look I'll go back to the point that, I made frequently. And it's around the level of visibility we have into our numbers. We've got confidence in our guidance ranges and we performed consistently against them since our IPO. And quarterly differences between last year and this year can cause growth rates to bounce around a little bit. Factors can include timing of go lives the amount of year-end services fees in Q1. We've got wallet revenue. And obviously, we have to do all the revenue accounting that we're required to do among many other things. But we're performing well. Our results are strong and we have a great amount of confidence into that visibility that we have in both Q3 and Q4 and expect to be able to achieve the guidance that we've set out.
Samad Samana: Great. And then maybe a follow-up for you David. Just as I look across the landscape one of your competitors had a really large reduction in force. And I'm just curious, just as you think about that and what maybe some of the other companies in the space you're doing you guys appear to be getting stronger. I'm just curious what do you think is leading to that inflection right now and are you seeing a change in where your wins are coming from as far as the incumbents that you're taking share from?
David Ossip: Thanks Samad. Look I think in difficult times it's where you see differentiation in terms of performance across organizations. And as you pointed out the strong gets stronger and the weak get weaker. We've seen our win rates go up quite considerably year-over-year as we find that our messaging which is largely a 12:1 simplification is being heard very well in the market. What the 12:1 refers to again is that we approach organizations and we clearly map out the different applications that make up their overall HR stack. We then work with the prospect to quantify how much they're paying in terms of subscription or licensing fees for each of those 12 different systems. We also quantify how many FTEs they have supporting each of those systems. We do the same for their integration platform the cost of integration the cost of aggregation and data reporting. And then, we show a move to Dayforce, which eliminates integration increases automation, reduces the number of FTEs required to support the system quite dramatically and also reduces the subscription fees that they have to pay for Dayforce versus the 12 different other systems. That message in this particular macro is very well received. From a technology perspective, we are differentiated with our single database and our single application. It's a very clean design for a product and our product capabilities whether it be the compliance modules or the talent modules are very competitive even against the best of breeds in irrespective areas. That allows us to show very well and at the same time, deliver a cash IRR to the actual customers. And that differentiates us in market and I think has led to our success.
Samad Samana: Great [indiscernible] Have a great day.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Berg from Needham.
Q – Scott Berg: Hi. Nice quarter. Thanks. I guess got two, I don't know if this is better suited for David or maybe Joe. David you spoke about solid bookings coming from the talent intelligence, functionality that you all have brought to the market the last year or two now. Is the current AI, tailwind that rhetoric helping that business knowing that that platform certainly has underpinnings within these technologies.
David Ossip: So Scott, already the customers can benefit from AI inside our platform. The design of the data within Dayforce is well formed and suited for AI, as well the overall ore experience of our customers is through our hub experience and remember, hub experience is essentially a content management system, designed for the CHR and their team to create really beautiful experiences that render both on the web and across mobile. Because the system is a content management system, we've been able to develop models that allow us to index the content for their respective audience of each of the documents that are uploaded into the hub and to make that available through the copilot in a ChatGPT type of format. And as well when we respond to the actual question by the person we're able to reference, the underlying source document where we actually got the questions from, that's available inside the actual platform and is very powerful and actually shows very, very nicely. At Discovery, this year you'll see Joe highlight where we're going from an AI perspective and it is very exciting. When we compare it to the competitors whether they be the ERPs or whether it be some of the best of breeds, I do believe that we have a strong advantage from an AI perspective that already is reflected in the US that we provide our customers, and allows them to get benefit.
Q – Scott Berg: Excellent. Very helpful. And then my follow-up Jeremy, I wanted to touch on your free cash flow comments kind of expectations and how you think about adjusted EBITDA or free cash flow. You and I recently had a conversation on this a couple of months ago, how do you move that conversion metric, without changing your level of debt? Or is that potentially contemplated in that strategy to move that conversion up?
Jeremy Johnson: Yes. Thanks, Scott. Look, first and foremost, I think I want to acknowledge the fact that we have made some really significant strides in free cash flow improvement over the last few years and we still have room to go. If you go back to two years ago I think our free cash flow margin was only a couple of percentage points and now we're actually heading towards something around 10% if you kind of do the math that we're laying out, which is going from our adjusted EBITDA margin at around 55% plus kind of upper 50% conversion rate into operating cash flow with capital expenditures remaining relatively constant on a dollar basis year-over-year. And then I will get you to kind of our expectations anyways on free cash flow. So it's pretty significant improvement in margin. Now a lot of that has been driven by our overall improvements in profitability. And the rest of it is and that will continue I should say, Scott. But we do think we can improve that conversion from kind of adjusted EBITDA into free cash flow with some balance sheet optimization and you're going to see us continue to push on things like DSO to really focus on cash as an operating metric and operate as if we're truly running this business on a cash basis, which is something that I think is a muscle we're building out here at Dayforce and I'm excited to lead the charge there. So I think we've got some really nice things happening. Q2 was a really nice quarter from an operating cash flow and a free cash flow perspective. And you can see that reflected in our SEC filings that it's going to be an area of focus for us in the future and free cash flow and that's not going to change.
Scott Berg: Excellent. Thanks. See you on the next quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho.
Siti Panigrahi: Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on a good quarter and good to see this free cash flow focus. But I want to ask question just a follow-up to Samad's question about your Q3 and Q4 guidance. So I just want to clarify, do you rely on any bookings in the second half to achieve your number? And second thing, you talked about the go lives visibility but in this kind of environment is there a risk for customers to delay their go-live or they will expedite is there any cost saving any kind of incentive for them. Also Jeremy could you talk about any assumption on macro for the rest of the year in terms of employment.
David Ossip: Hey, Siti, nice to speak with you. The forecast for Q3 and Q4 is largely built up by the work in process of the accounts that are currently going through implementation. In the first half of the year we actually came in ahead of our forecast. And so we've got a high degree of confidence that the go-live will go as planned. Typically we hit the go-live forecast and usually actually exceed it. So we aren't concerned about the macro from a perspective of any delays in terms of go-live. In fact we remain very confident on that.
Jeremy Johnson: Yes. And maybe just to answer your second question on some of the more macro things we're seeing here. Employment levels really it's a fluid picture right now with some pockets of strength in industries and segments that we have success in. We also have some pockets of weakness but it's ultimately resulting in an overall picture that is kind of in line with our expectations, which is flat employment levels year-over-year. Collectively, I think our view on Dayforce and not the overall economy, but we believe it should kind of remain steady from where we're seeing things right now and we're definitely optimistic on limited downside.
David Ossip: Siti, what I would add is that we've built the company on a very durable growth profile and we remain quite in tune with the overall macro because of the requirements for our particular market is largely driven by the jurisdictions, not by particular organizations or even particular industries. It allows us to pivot as needed to where the market still is quite strong. Year-to-date, we've had a lot of success in industries like hospitality, which I would say is doing very, very well. Obviously, we've also invested quite a lot in public sector over the last number of years, and we're seeing that yield a lot of benefit as you see with the Government of Canada types of deals. And as asked earlier, we also have the ability to pivot on a macro on a global basis to go to where economies are strong and are growing. And I think that's been quite consistent over the last number I suppose six years where there's been quite a lot of challenges if you like at times in the overall economy whether it be COVID come back from COVID et cetera where we've been able to navigate and continue growing the company quite robustly over that period of time.
Siti Panigrahi: Great. Thanks for the color.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Enders from Citi.
Steve Enders: Okay. Great. Thanks for taking the questions here. I guess maybe to start, I think you called out in the prepared remarks that -- over half of the new bookings and come from add-on sales this quarter. And I guess I would just like to get a little bit better understanding for maybe kind of what drove the strength there this quarter or if there's anything to call out on that side? Or maybe something slowing down on kind of the net new coming in just may get a little bit more detail on what's supporting that right now?
David Ossip: Yeah, Steve. If you recall last quarter, we spoke about the fact that we felt that we could lift up the sales back to the base. We had an analysis by a consulting group at the end of last year, where as you know, our gross retention rates on clients at 97.1% is by far best in class. However, they did point out from an NRR perspective that we could lift up. So we made some purposeful moves at the end of last year, we brought in a very strong leader for the client base sales. We've built up that team quite substantially. We put in motion programs to basically go back to the actual base to make sure that they're aware of what the capabilities of the actual product are. We've taken the 12:1 simplification message back to the base and that's been quite well too. And we're beginning to see that take traction. It's important for us as we look towards a much longer targets. If we look towards 2021 also, we do believe that we have to get to a 50-50 blend between net new sales and between sales back to the base. When we sell back to the base, as well the profitability profile is quite different than what you see with net new sales. Obviously, the cost of sales is lower so higher sales productivity which I think is very important. Second, because the customer is already live and we already have the cloud environment and we have the support teams around the client. Typically, you get a higher gross margin on recurring on the add-on sales than you do get on net. Second from a client acquisition cost basis from an LTV basis, the profile of add-on sales is obviously very, very good. And even if I look at our net new sales client acquisition costs or LTV numbers where they're fantastic. So it's very much purposeful, which will allow us to hit our longer-term growth and our longer-term profitability and cash flow targets.
Steve Enders: Okay. No that's helpful context there. I guess, maybe just I guess with regards to the deal environment and the net new opportunities coming in the door like how are you, I guess, how does that kind of shake out in the quarter? And how are you feeling about where the pipeline is today and the ability to close on net new coming through the door?
David Ossip: Our pipeline remains very strong. If I look at the next four quarters, we're operating at about a 4x coverage, which is very helpful and very healthy and typically above historical targets. When I look at the number of open opportunities that are closed we'll say in the next 120 days, I'll say they're at record levels. So we are seeing still a robust market for us in general. That 12:1 simplification message really does help. We've also had some other tailwinds as well. The branding exercise that we've done and some of the investments we've made on the marketing side begin to take hold. I think that our reputation in industry and you do your field research you'll find the product is very differentiated. If you look at again our client retention rates, if you look at our NPS schools they're by far best-in-class in the industry. If you look at our services, experience that our customers are having we're very proud of that as well. So I think we'll continue to execute quite well in the actual marketplace. And I think you will see us continue to do well as we go into the future.
Steve Enders: Okay, perfect. Thanks for taking the questions.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bhavin Shah from Deutsche Bank.
Bhavin Shah: Great. Thanks for taking my question. David, can you just maybe give us an update on the SI relationships and partnerships? Kind of where are they in terms of the ramp to be able to sell in prime deals themselves? And kind of how much of your new bookings is kind of led by the channel today? And where do you think it goes over the next year or two?
David Ossip: Yeah, Bhavin, as I mentioned in my script, we saw a nice growth year-over-year in terms of SI prime deals and obviously the involvement of the SIs in the actual deal. We have Steve here with us as well. So let's Steve maybe provide a bit more color.
Steve Holdridge: Yeah. I mean, I think it's steady as she goes. What we've been talking about the past three years we continue to execute. I was actually just in our Toronto office yesterday and we had 50 of our leading partners in for a number of days. So we're focused on really three things. We're focused on helping them sell and create demand on their own in the marketplace. We're focused on enabling them. And we'll continue to see strong acceleration in growth. Our target is the same as we talked about. We want 75% of the deals out there to be SI-led across all markets. We're beginning to specialize around industries and regions with both global SIs as well as regional SIs. So it's been successful in an area we continue to invest on and see return in both demand creation and giving the customers choice.
Bhavin Shah: Super helpful. Just one quick follow-up maybe for Jeremy. Just great to see the buyback and focus on free cash flow. Does that change your philosophy at all on M&A or even the types of deals you aren’t looking at?
Jeremy Johnson: Thanks Bhavin. Look it's the first time we talked about this here, so I do want to highlight the fact that we did announce this $500 million share repurchase program. I think there's a couple of goals to this. One is obviously reducing the impact of future share dilution from employee stock issuances. And the second is that to capitalize on what we believe are currently undervalued shares. And you'll see us be opportunistic in the market on that front. We plan to execute those share repurchases through over market transactions. And ultimately this increasing free cash flow that we're seeing is behind a lot of this. I think when you think about how we plan to deploy our capital in the future, it still will remain to be kind of opportunistic M&A pipeline where we see deals that make sense to our business and that's either to kind of expand our platform like we've done in the past or kind of to expand our TAM and go global -- more global or in more adjacent markets. The other option obviously is to return shares to our capital to shareholders. And I think this is a really nice way to start doing that. And you'll see us kind of balance all of those in our capital allocation.
Bhavin Shah: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brad Reback from Stifel.
Brad Reback: Great. Thanks very much. Great. David, can you remind us the new customer account continues to moderate. Is that a shift in go-to-market? Or are there other dynamics going on underneath the covers there?
David Ossip: It's a move up market. If you look at the average revenue from clients up about 18% year-over-year, it's -- I think that is actually quite important. It also reflects that we are now looking towards a long-term blend between sales back to the base and net new sales. Remember we spent a tremendous amount on PNT over the last number of years, building our very robust and very deep talent modules. And so we do see a lot of white space in our existing client base. What I would point out is that, if we look at our overall market share relative to the TAM, we're still very low. Our overall market share is probably just under 3%, so we have still tons of white space in the market to acquire new customers. And it kind of converges, as we get higher depth of module density across our client base, our reputation does go up as well and word does spread. And I think we're operating now with a very good brand in market that we're quite proud of.
Brad Reback: That's great. And so just one quick follow-up on that, should we expect it to stabilize at sort of this 350 level? Or could it moderate a little bit more from here before it finds its bottom?
David Ossip: I'm sorry, what are you referring to in terms of the 350?
Brad Reback: The sequential adds in customers?
David Ossip: We don't run the company from that perspective. And remember, if we add a very large organization with hundreds of thousands of employees, counts as one. If we add a major market account with 1,000 employees, it counts as one. So I wouldn't look at that number quite honestly from any purpose. It is not a number that we look at internally.
Brad Reback: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Jester from BMO.
Daniel Jester: Great. Thanks for taking my question. So maybe to take the conversation a little bit different direction, about a year ago David, you had talked about some of the efforts that you're doing internally to deploy Generative AI to boost efficiency inside the organization around customer support and the like. Maybe is there any update in terms of what you're seeing from those efforts now that they've been in the field for a while?
David Ossip: Yes, it's been great. We've seen efficiency gains of about 14%, 15% in our customer support organization. I had spoken about this on previous calls that we learned a lot through that and that allowed us to build out the Gen AI capabilities and the Copilot capabilities in the Dayforce product. The area that we focused on from a customer delivery perspective is in line with what we saw in terms of the efficiency of our support department, which is allow the HR departments to load documents into the hub experience index those documents and then allow the Copilot to be used to query those particular documents. So, if you're a client, you could load up a job sharing policy, a maternity policy, and an employee could then ask questions such as, hey, I'm having a baby, when can I take off? How do I get paid? How do I come back, type of thing and the product answers actually very nicely with the reference links. Our expectation is that our customers should see a similar efficiency gain across their HR business partners in terms of handling queries from the actual employees, while at the same time, really drastically improving the overall experience for the frontline workers, the frontline managers, and for the Executives. So, it was actually a very, very good experience. By the way, we actually have now incorporated that same AI tool or into the overall product. So, if you're an admin user, those implementation guides and support guides are part of the document that you're in the audience for. So, you have the ability to ask questions about configuration to the actual Copilot as well. And so that we also believe will further our support organization in that the AI will handle a lot of those questions.
Daniel Jester: Great. Thank you very much. And then as a follow-up. Recently, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced some rules around earned wage access. I guess, as you think about what's going on there in the Wallet, are there any implications? Thank you.
David Ossip: So, Daniel, first of all, we've had a very good year from a Wallet perspective. We believe that Wallet revenue this year will go up by more than 100%. In terms of the EWA kind of legislation, remember that we do not do a payday loan. We're quite unique in industry that any time you add money to the Wallet we do an off-cycle payroll. We generate a pay slip and we do the remittances within 24 hours at the federal and state levels. And that is very different than the other players in the market that typically use a bolt-on technology where it is a payday loan type of construct. We've spoken about this for quite several years that we were very particular in the way that we constructed the Dayforce Wallet so that it would be a true payroll to the employee. When you look at the actual funding mechanism where we effectively lend money to the employers, so the employer can pay the employee when they do an on-demand payroll is very unique. And the fact that we do the remittances in the 24 hours, again, is very unique as well. And lastly, from an employee perspective, it's never a loan situation. Beginning of the period, you can add nothing to your Wallet. If I work eight hours at the end of that shift provided that I've covered all the necessary limits and taxes and garnishments only then, am I able to take out my net earnings. And all of this is actually predicated on that continuous pay engine that we have, whereby any time there's a change to the employee record, a benefit record, a time record, we calculate net earnings. Again, we're the only one in the industry that does that, and that's why we can do it in a compliant and non-payday loan mechanism.
Daniel Jester: Very clear. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays.
Raimo Lenschow: Hey. Thank you. Thanks for squeezing me in and congrats from me as well. If I look at the industry David and Jeremy, the one problem that everyone seems to be struggling, not you but everyone else is that, that their customers are not expanding their employees. So, there's not a lot more new payroll guys coming in, and the guys that charge per paycheck obviously see it immediately, but even guys that are playing more upmarket kind of started talking about it in terms of true-ups not coming through. How is that the case for you? Are you just kind of on a different cycle the expansion that you guys are seeing from moving upmarket is helping you to offset that? Or are you seeing that as well? Like, can you help us how you're doing so much better than the other guys? Thank you.
David Ossip: Yes. There are two reasons for that, Raimo, nice to speak with you. The first, as you know, we're the leader in terms of global compliance. And in our target market, which again remember is in the mid to the large enterprise space, almost all of our customers are global in nature. So when we talk about sales back to the base, a lot of that actually is expansion into new geos. And that's quite different than most of the other players in the market. The second is remember, Joe joined the organization probably about three-plus years ago, with a focus on really lifting up our talent capabilities. And we're now seeing that our talent capability being best in class. Again, we're in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for organizations that are more than 1,000 employees for HCM, so for the talent components. We have a lot of white space in our 6,700 or so customers that are live. And again, bringing in a very strong leader to go back to the actual client base and having really a product marketing and branding strategy around that, has allowed us to start selling back to the base. And that's a new motion for us. So in that regard, we are on an early cycle. Now when I talk about the actual ERPs, what I think is happening in market is, I think the ERPs have sold a lot of shelfware. And so when they are hitting their renewals, they may be seeing lower renewal rates. I don't think it is lowering employee accounts, because we are not seeing that.
Raimo Lenschow: Okay. Perfect. Thank you for the clarification. And then one for Jeremy. Congrats on the share buyback announcement, that's really helpful. Do you have any indication a little bit of like how you think about deploying that? Is that -- are you kind of doing it opportunistic? Is there like a level per quarter you're thinking about, is there a valuation that you have in your mind that you're kind of having each quarter? Like, what's the cadence there? Thank you.
Jeremy Johnson: Yes. Thanks Raimo. Look, we -- today we think the shares are undervalued and we'll continue to monitor that and be opportunistic with how we buy back. Maybe make a point about us being comfortable with debt as well, right? And we, obviously, have debt obligations. We have been a levered company. We've maintained our ability to manage against gross and net leverage targets. And you'll continue to see us use debt financing in general in this business to fund both M&A and any kind of organic and inorganic opportunities that we see. So, you're going to see us look at share buybacks, kind of M&A, organic growth and utilize -- continue to utilize debt financing in our overall capital allocation. And I think we're going to take a nice balanced approach, but be opportunistic when we believe our shares are undervalued which we think they are today.
Raimo Lenschow: Perfect. Thank you. Congrats.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jared Levine from TD Cowen.
Jared Levine: Thank you. Based on year-to-date signings, what does that inform you regarding January 2025 go live and how does that compare to this past January?
Jeremy Johnson: I'm sorry Jerry. Can you repeat that question? We lost you a little bit.
Jared Levine: Yes. So, in terms of year-to-date signings, what does that inform you regarding January of 2025 go lives? And how does that compare to this past January?
David Ossip: I'm sorry, Jared, I'm missing the reference to January '25, could you…
Jared Levine: Yes, based on year-to-date signings, what does it inform you about this upcoming January go live?
Jeremy Johnson: It's early for January right for '25.
Steve Holdridge: Yes. And maybe I'd say look, we're -- year-to-date, we're having I think really good success in our go lives and great visibility into what we expect to do for the rest of the year. I think as we look out our guidance would contemplate strength in go-lives this year heading into next year. And I think our bookings are solid and we're comfortable with those throughout the year and we see nice strength as we head into the rest of the year. So, I think if that answers your question is, we're feeling pretty confident about our ability to continue to execute on growth and go lives.
David Ossip: Jared, I would say, if you look at the guide for the second half of the year, you see strength in the remainder of the half especially in Q4 and that's a setup for obviously Q1.
Jared Levine: Okay. Perfect. And then in terms of sales headcount, can you provide an update on your fiscal year sales side count targets and how those are trending year-to-date?
David Ossip: So we don't actually provide numbers as to the actual number of sellers. But what I can say is, we're obviously very happy with the build-out of the sales team. We continue to strengthen the leadership with inside that sales team. We're quite happy with the sales productivity as well. Obviously the results speak for themselves as well. Sales has been good year-to-date. As I often comment during the earnings call, the first month of Q3 has also come in quite well too.
Jared Levine: That’s perfect. Thank you.
David Niederman: So we're out of time. So we're going to conclude the call at this point. I'll turn it over to David for closing remarks.
David Ossip: Just thank you everyone for joining us today. I look forward to speaking with the rest -- with many of you over the next few hours. Thanks again.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-05-01 08:00:00) =====
Jeremy Johnson: I am Jeremy Johnson our CFO, and joining me on the call today is CEO, David Ossip; Chief Product and Technology Officer, Joe Korngiebel; and our President, Steve Holdridge. [Operator Instructions] Now before I hand the call over to David, I want to remind everyone that our commentary may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause Dayforce's results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as the cautionary statements in our filings.  
 Additionally, over the course of this call, we'll reference non-GAAP measures to describe our performance please review our earnings press release and filings with the SEC for our rationale behind the use of non-GAAP measures and for a full reconciliation of these GAAP to non-GAAP metrics. These documents, in addition to a replay of this call will be available on the Dayforce Investor Relations website.  
 And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to David. 
David Ossip: Thanks, Jeremy, and thank you all for joining us. Next to me, I have Steve who will review customer and market highlights. Joe, who will highlight platform innovation and then we'll hand the call back to Jeremy to provide details to our first quarter performance and updated full year outlook. 
 In the first quarter, I'm pleased to report another strong quarter for Dayforce. We grew both revenue and profit materially, and we exceeded guidance across all key revenue and profitability metrics. Dayforce recurring revenue of $337 million was up 24%, including float and 23% excluding float and total revenue of $431.5 million increased 16%.  
 On the profitability side, GAAP gross profit was $205 million, up 28% from last year. Cloud recurring gross margin was 79%, up 170 basis points versus last year and adjusted cloud recurring gross margin was 80%, up 130 basis points versus last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $130 million, up 23%, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 30.1%, up 170 basis points versus last year.  
 We remain confident in the business with strong momentum across sales, product and operations, and we have raised our guidance across all key metrics. As we look at the rest of the year and well beyond it, the HCM market opportunity is very large and continues to expand. Estimates of global HCM and managed payroll spending are currently in the $50 billion to $60 billion range and growing at over 10% annually based on the Dayforce analysis of IDC data.  
 This continues to be a resilient and durable market of growth. Dayforce is well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity in front of us. As organizations of all sizes across the world need to be more productive and to optimize their technology and processes, leaders need to create quantifiable value for their organizations and better experiences for their people with the platforms they choose and Dayforce meets that demand by providing simplicity at scale.  
 Simplicity at scale is at the core of our product innovation, particularly as we accelerate with our AI capabilities with Dayforce Co-Pilot for both our customers and inside our organization. As we've discussed, our approach to AI is built on our foundation of trusted compliance and a single source of data.  
 We launched the charter version of Dayforce Co-Pilot and have seen our initial customers and their employees utilize Co-Pilot as an AI teammate to help supercharge productivity. We believe there are numerous use cases across our customer base to help them gain a competitive advantage by using Dayforce Co-Pilot.  
 Internally, it's been very exciting to see how Co-Pilot has significantly enhanced the Dayforce experience within our own Dayforce environment. answering questions and surfacing critical company content to help our daymakers be more productive every day. Joe will share more on our progress shortly, but I'm very encouraged with our pace of innovation.  
 Finally, I'm happy to announce the appointment of our new Chief People Officer, Amy, who joined Dayforce and our leadership team this week. Amy brings extensive experience, driving business growth through talent training and development, workforce engagement and exclusivity and operational efficiencies. Welcome to the team, Amy.  
 In summary, we had a strong start to 2024, and I remain excited for the year ahead. I'd like to thank our strong community, our customers, partners and daymakers. I'll now pass the call to Steve to discuss customer and market highlights. Steve, over to you. 
Stephen Holdridge: Thanks, David. In Q1, we delivered balanced and consistent growth across customer acquisition, activation, expansion and retention. We had strong results for sales, kickoffs and go-lives. We ended the quarter with Dayforce recurring revenue per customer up 19% year-over-year. And we now have 6,575 customers live on the Dayforce platform.  
 From a sales perspective, we continue to see strong demand for Dayforce across the globe and saw an acceleration of competitive wins in our mid-market segment as a complement to the continued expansion in our enterprise segments we've talked about before.  
 Sales pipeline remains healthy, and we see steady demand for the Dayforce full suite platform in all regions. Our partner ecosystem momentum continued into Q1 with SI-led sales growth up 35% year-over-year. We continue to demonstrate the strength of our overall Dayforce platform, attaching full suite to nearly 50% of new sales bookings.  
 We also saw continued performance across our customer base sales motion with customer add-on sales comprising nearly 40% of total bookings, including significant growth in our talent intelligence suite. And on Dayforce Wallet, we saw healthy traction with over 1,200 customers live and 1,960 new customers added in total.  
 Average wallet registration rates continue to trend positively remaining above 65%, and we continue with healthy wallet usage of about 25x per month. We also launched 2 new revenue-generating features to wallet in the first quarter. Instant Transfer, which allows users to move money off the card instantly using credit rails for a fee; and Cash App transfer, which allows users to move money to cash apps and provides Dayforce with the interchange revenue.  
 We received positive news out of the Government of Canada, which secured additional budget to progress the payroll modernization project. We expect to see continued investment in the program and expanded opportunity for Dayforce and our partners with potential acceleration of related revenues in 2025.  
 Now turning to key sales wins from across the globe in Q1. A large Canadian grocer is expanding its existing Dayforce partnership with the addition of Dayforce talent to support more than 100,000 employees. A U.S. energy company with 17,000 employees has selected Dayforce for payroll and workforce management. One of the world's leading independent insurance brokers has chosen the full Dayforce suite for 9,300 employees in 29 countries.  
 Western Digital Technologies, a global provider of disk drives and flash memories is expanding its existing partnership with Dayforce by adding managed payroll for 8,000 employees in the U.S. Carhartt selected Dayforce as its global people platform for 3,500 employees across 7 countries.  
 One of the top 10 dental support organizations in the U.S. selected Dayforce as a strategic partner to support 5,000 employees. Some of the key Q1 customer go-lives included an international real estate developer and property manager launched Dayforce managed payroll, managed benefits, time and attendance to 22,000 U.S. employees.  
 A global manufacturing and retail organization with 65,000 employees across 56 countries extended its Dayforce use to include its Malaysian operations. Windstream Holdings went live with the full Dayforce suite for 9,500 employees across the U.S. and Canada.  
 A global analytics professional services company with over 35,000 employees in 40 countries expanded its Dayforce use to 6,000 U.K. employees. And a California grocery chain with 18,000 employees in 170 locations went live with Dayforce managed pay, time, attendance and advanced scheduling.  
 With that, I'm now pleased to hand off to my innovation partner, Joe Korngiebel, our Chief Product and Technology Officer. Joe, over to you. 
Joseph Korngiebel: Thank you, Steve. We had a fast and exciting start to 2024 in terms of product innovation. As you heard from David, with the launch of Dayforce Co-Pilot to our charter customers at the beginning of the year, our new generative AI teammate for the balanced workforce is empowering our customers, their employees and also our own employees here at Dayforce with new levels of productivity and efficiency.  
 This cutting-edge innovation marks a significant milestone in our commitment to make work-life better for our customers and their entire workforce. Dayforce Co-Pilot provides instant answers to common workforce questions from the data that is often buried within large employee handbooks, detailed benefits guides and lengthy corporate FAQs.   
 Powered by our best-in-class data and per customer, large language model architecture, we are just beginning the innovation with Dayforce Co-Pilot. We are now expanding beyond our initial answering questions and summarizing data use cases into full-fledged task automation and content generation with generative AI and it's all within the seamless in context Dayforce Co-Pilot user experience.  
 As we iterate and continue this transformative journey, we extend our sincere gratitude to our early customers for their invaluable partnership and feedback. Together, we are truly shaping the future of work and setting a new standard of excellence in our industry. We are delivering Dayforce Co-Pilot as a new simply priced add-on to our entire suite of HCM products.  
 As you can tell, I'm excited about the value that our customers are starting to realize with Dayforce Co-Pilot and the massive impact that a single system that provides a single source of truth for their people data can have on their business.  
 In addition to these innovations with Dayforce Co-Pilot, we also delivered several key innovations to help our customers optimize their talent, manage compliance, drive productivity and build great employee experiences. We delivered improved candidate and recruiting experiences within our talent products to enable faster and more efficient recruiting processes when they're needed most.  
 We launched Dayforce Alumni Management, a new product that helps organizations maintain strong relationships with their past employees who can become boomerang talent or even refer new talent to a business. We enhanced our leading workforce management products to support companies that have multi-locations, multi-departments in order to drive greater efficiencies through centralized and multiweek calendaring scheduling in a flash.  
 And finally, on compliance, which is job one for us here at Dayforce. we added more than 160 global compliance updates just in the first quarter. This includes enhanced year-end requirements, optimized reporting functionality, expanded data import capabilities and complete updates to our CAC rates to help our customers operate with confidence. A truly exciting start to the year for us and our customers. But now let's talk financials. Over to you, Jeremy. 
Jeremy Johnson: Thanks, Joe. We started 2024 strong, underpinned by healthy top line growth and continued profitability improvements. As David said, we exceeded guidance across all key revenue and profitability metrics. We delivered Dayforce recurring revenue of $337.2 million, growing 24% and excluding float, Dayforce recurring revenue grew 23% underpinned by strong go-lives and healthy underlying customer trends.  
 Total revenue of $431.5 million grew 16% on a GAAP basis and 17% on a constant currency basis, highlighting the continued convergence of Dayforce recurring revenue and total revenue growth rates, as 78% of our total revenue is Dayforce recurring revenue.  
 Powerpay recurring revenue was $26 million, growing 8%, including float and 5% excluding float. On a GAAP basis, gross profit was $205 million, up 28%; and operating profit was $41 million, up 6%, including a full quarter of the amortization of the Ceridian trade name, which is in G&A expenses at approximately $21 million.  
 Cloud recurring gross margin was 79%, up 170 basis points versus last year. And excluding float, our cloud recurring gross margin also continued to expand nicely, improving by 170 basis points year-over-year. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted cloud recurring gross margin was 80%, expanding 130 basis points year-over-year as the Dayforce platform continues to scale.  
 We view adjusted cloud recurring gross margins as a key metric that shows how much we make from an average dollar of recurring revenue after customers go-live on the platform. It's a great comparison to our HCM peers and market and it excludes noncash items like depreciation, share-based compensation as well as R&D-related costs.  
 Adjusted EBITDA was $129.9 million, up 23% or a 30.1% margin, expanding 170 basis points year-over-year and reflecting our continued improvement in gross profit margins and scale in adjusted G&A. From a cash flow perspective, operating cash flows were $9.1 million in Q1, $2 million lower than last year, primarily due to higher trade receivables.  
 This was the result of timing, specifically related to the change in our brand name as some customer payment cycles were delayed as a result of our name change to Dayforce. We remain confident in our full year cash flow targets of upper 50% conversion from full year adjusted EBITDA to operating cash flow.  
 As expected, eloomi revenue added approximately 100 basis points of growth to our Dayforce recurring revenue in the first quarter.  
 Looking ahead, for the full year, we now expect Dayforce recurring revenue ex float of $1.163 billion to $1.168 billion or growth of 21% as reported and on a constant currency basis. Total revenue of $1.73 billion to $1.74 billion or approximately 14% to 15% growth as reported and on a constant currency basis.  
 Adjusted EBITDA of $484 million to $499 million or 28% to 28.7% margin. Float revenue is now expected to be $183 million for the full year, reflecting fewer rate cuts than originally anticipated. For the second quarter, we expect Dayforce recurring revenue ex float of $276 million to $279 million, or growth in the range of 19% to 21% as reported or 20% to 21% on a constant currency basis.  
 Total revenue of $414 million to $419 million or growth of 13% to 15% as reported and on a constant currency basis. And adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $108 million to $113 million or 26.1% to 27% margin. Float revenue is expected to be $47 million for the second quarter.  
 As you recall, there are typically a handful of items that impact sequential growth between Q1 and Q2, including year-end print and filing revenue that drive Q1 higher but don't reoccur in Q2 and seasonal employee volumes that tend to fall off in Q2. This is reflected in our guidance.  
 We have also updated the FX rate assumptions used for our guidance as the current spot rate of approximately USD 1.37 to CAD has worsened from the 1.33 level observed at the beginning of 2024.  
 Before we go into Q&A, I want to remind investors and stakeholders that our financial reporting and accounting policies are underpinned by strong processes and procedures that undergo multiple layers of internal and external review. We stand behind our financial reporting and accounting policies, which have been carefully considered, reviewed and audited and transparently disclosed since becoming a public company in 2018.  
 We encourage investors to review our financial statements along with our past earnings call, transcripts and press releases for a comprehensive view of our financial profile, our accounting policies and our viewpoint on key financial and operating metrics.  
 Thank you for your continued support and conviction in Dayforce. We are excited for the future.  
 With that, we can begin the Q&A portion of our call. 
Matthew Wells: Thanks, Jeremy. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Mark? 
Mark Marcon: I've got 2 questions. One, The government of Canada in their 2024 budget, they basically ended up committing $135 million Canadian to improve public service, human resources and pay systems. That's up materially relative to the CAD 52 million that they had allocated during the prior year. And so what I'm wondering is, first of all, it sounds like things are really progressing well. You had mentioned on the call that you don't anticipate seeing a major step up until 2025. I know that there's some sensitivities in terms of what you can disclose, but it sounds like things are going really well. And I'm wondering if you can give us any additional perspective in terms of what the next milestones are, what we should be monitoring? Because this is obviously a huge deal. 
Stephen Holdridge: Mark, this is Steve Holdridge, I'll take that and anyone is welcome to jump in. Yes, as I said on the call, we view this as positive news, right? This is a statement of continued commitment. It is a budget expansion going into that. So in terms of the macro, this further cements step. Keep in mind that this is a long-term program.  
 It's probably a minimum of 2 years before we even begin to see the first set of go lives. A big chunk of this is to continue the funding from prior years. Another big chunk of it goes to the government in terms of their labor and infrastructure. And then there's a bunch of partners we have with it. But we do expect an uptick, a lot of it focused on the implementation and services sort of work. And then in early 2025, we'll expect to see some increases in employee volumes there. So overall positive, but part of a long journey. 
Mark Marcon: Got it. And then as my follow-up, Dayforce Co-Pilot, David and Joe, you both sounded extremely excited about it. Joe, you mentioned that there's simplified pricing around it. Wondering, can you give us any sense with regards to the incremental pricing and what the early customer feedback is and how you expect that to translate to upsell to the existing client base? 
Joseph Korngiebel: Mark, good to hear your voice, and thank you for the question. Yes, Co-Pilot is a foundational really transformation in how people use a people platform to be able to get answers and make more efficient and productive decisions for their employees.  
 We started with an early design program, we brought customers in early to start to vet out how the value could be realized. That early partnership work with our customers is transformed now into a charter program. We have our early customers leveraging it with their customers, uploading documents so they can see the answers that are oftentimes vary in different documents, as I mentioned, to be able to answer it, so it really takes the workload off of your HR admins and your staff.  
 It can really optimize the performance of your staff in terms of their ability to get answers done and get back to their job. For us, that is rolling out now. We'll then go from that to general availability in the second half of this year. As I mentioned in my statements, we are simplifying the pricing.  
 There's a lot in the industry going on around complex pricing in these type of generative AI tools. For us, it's an add-on to any of our products within our HCM suite. And so if you just buy 1 product or buy a full suite, you can add that on to get the productivity boost. And our customers are giving us the feedback, that's exactly what we want. We're obviously seeing within our prospective customers the same kind of interest and it really moves us forward. 
Mark Marcon: Can I sneak 1 more in? Jeremy, did you build anything in, in terms of recurring for this? 
Jeremy Johnson: Mark, we at this point, probably not incrementally in. I think we're testing out the use cases. We're building this up with customer base and probably not incrementally at this point. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh from UBS. Kevin? 
Kevin McVeigh: Congratulations on the results. I think you referenced kind of the SI-led sales growth in the quarter was about 35%. Can you give us an update on where that is in terms of some of the transition from professional services -- on the professional services side to the SIs and how that sales distribution channel is going forward? Because it seems like part of the story that's starting to kind of scale? 
Stephen Holdridge: Yes. And I think we've been consistent in that. Over the past few years, we've seen steady growth in that. We've also been very public that our strategy is to move to primarily an SI-led ecosystem, even broader than SIs, right, advisory partners, partners with PE. We continue to see strength on that, both with the large global systems integrators where we continue to see expansion as well as a number of regional mid-market. 
 We expect for the balance of the year, the growth in SIs to outpace even our growth of bookings, and we expect to see penetration across all markets. We have high penetrations in EMEA and APJ, where we haven't built up the sort of services capabilities. What has allowed us in the U.S. to do is focus our services on new and emerging products and really supporting SIs with technology and product-specific capability. 
Kevin McVeigh: It's very helpful. And then just with the uptick in flow, any change philosophically as to how we should think about just whether that gets redeployed or kind of just any impact because obviously, that seems like somewhat unexpected given where rates are, but just remind us of how we're thinking about that incremental float benefit? 
Jeremy Johnson: Yes. Thanks, Kevin. It's obviously a nice surprise that float is going to stick around a little bit longer here. We will continue to look for opportunities to invest. There's a significant amount of growth that we can go after. We've got a bunch that we can do on the product side of things. But at the same time, we know we have margin targets and free cash flow targets that we want to hit. So you'll probably see us take a balanced approach here with the float. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Raimo? 
Raimo Lenschow: Can I just double click a little bit what you're seeing out there in the economy, like in terms of interest on starting new projects? You obviously have a long list of new clients that you announced, which is really good to see. But what's the overall appetite in terms of thinking about traditional transformation in the HCM space? And how much is AI kind of talking point, you kind of open doors for that one? And then I had 1 follow-up for Jeremy. 
David Ossip: Sure. Raimo, good to speak with you. Raimo, just check your math on your early report as well in terms of the guide. We actually pushed the full amount to the full year. Not half of it, so just a correction in your note. In terms of your question, if we look at the actual pipeline, the pipeline levels remain very healthy and robust. What we're seeing in the industry is that there is a focus on increased automation, and the way that typically translates is that we would come in and we often see a simplification of 12 systems to about 1.  
 And as we simplify the environment for the client, it means that you have more automation, less integration, less manual effort, less manual errors, less FTEs, higher efficiencies. And that messaging is resonating very well in today's economy, and I think it's reflected in the numbers and the accounts that Steve spoke about. 
Raimo Lenschow: Good. Perfect. And then Jeremy, you talked a little bit about that extra float revenue coming in there. Can you talk a little bit about some of the priorities that if you think about balancing it out, some of the priorities in terms of kind of maybe giving us more versus kind of investing more, like where would that be? And congrats from me as well, and I'll look into that, David. 
Jeremy Johnson: Yes. Thanks, Raimo. I think when we talk about getting incremental float dollars that either could flow right down to the bottom line or we can choose to reinvest those funds -- there is, as I mentioned, kind of a lot of room to grow in this business. We're talking about our ability to go global.  
 We're talking about expanding across the HCM space and launching new products and investing in things like AI. So I look at it really as how much do we put into sales, marketing to continue growth and how much do we put into product and technology versus taking to the bottom line. And I do think that our opportunity is huge out there.  
 As you heard us talk to that the HCM market is a really big one with a huge TAM that's growing nicely, and we're really well positioned to go and capitalize on some of that. That's when I say we'll take a balanced approach, we'll definitely look at both taking and expanding margins as well as continuing to invest in the growth opportunities that are out there. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question comes from Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho. 
Sitikantha Panigrahi: So David, when I look at your peers' growth, it's just rating in your payroll space, but you continue to deliver 20%-plus or guide 20%-plus on your recurring -- Dayforce recurring ex float. So what gives you confidence that you will continue to deliver that kind of 20% kind of growth? 
David Ossip: Yes. Thanks, Siti. The first thing that I'll point out is that if you look at the actual quarter, add-ons, which is adding the employer of record and the talent component was 14% of our sales. And if we look at full suite sales in the quarter, it was 50%. So when you look at Dayforce, we aren't a payroll company, we are an HCM company, which gives us a much more durable growth profile than others in the market that are more focused on the actual pay.  
 And when we look at the breadth of our application and the depth of each of the different modules, you'll find that they are very competitive even with the stand-alone talent vendors out there. Part of our growth as well is, as you know, we are across segment whether it be the major market space, which goes up to about 1,000; the major markets -- sorry, the enterprise -- sorry, major markets goes from about 700 to about 1,000; a major market from about 1,000 to about 3,000 and then we have enterprise from 3,000 to 12,000 and large enterprise above.  
 But the different segmentation gives us also the ability to emphasize differently based on the actual macro. And as well, we have a very strong global profile, which also allows us to balance growth across different markets as the macro changes as well. 
Sitikantha Panigrahi: And a follow-up. When I look at your pipeline -- not pipeline actually the deals you closed since Q1 of 2022, large deals, in terms of enterprise, you mentioned before that go-lives should be around 2 years-or-so. How is the go-live trend right now in terms of your confidence of those companies going live with those large deals? And how is that going to help drive that growth as of this year and next year? 
David Ossip: Well, Siti, as we've discussed before, the larger accounts give us more the durable growth profile as the implementations do stretch typically across different years. If we look at the large logistic company, as you know, a nice proportion of their population went live previously, and we are expecting additional waves to go live shortly. But again, it allows us to plan out the business very, very carefully, and you see that reflected in the very tight revenue and EBITDA guide we give to the market. It's a highly plannable business. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question comes from Scott Berg with Needham. Maybe we can circle back on Scott. Next, we'll go to Steve Enders from Citi. 
Steven Enders: Okay. Great. I guess maybe just to start, I think you called out mid-market win rates improving in the quarter? Just I guess it would be helpful to get a little bit more clarity on what you view as driving that? And then maybe just a little bit more detail on what you're seeing in terms of overall demand dynamics between mid-market and enterprise today? 
Stephen Holdridge: Yes. This is Steve. I'll take that, and anyone can jump in on that. So in the past, we've continued and you've seen some great wins up market in terms of the enterprise, and we continue to see that. What we have seen is our ability to, one, be in more deals in mid-market as we've increased the sales coverage, we've got more focus on our go-to-market and continue to increase our win rate.  
 We feel our suite fits 100%, and we tend to lead with the full suite there. So we're confident. And as David talked about, our advantage is that we have a balanced portfolio. We've seen some increase in mid-market, and we're continuing to drive large enterprise and we think it's a combination of those that feed into our guidance in the predictability of the full year revenue. 
Steven Enders: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then maybe for Jeremy, just in terms of thinking about profitability dynamics kind of through the year and 2Q has some seasonality in there. But I guess any kind of like change in investment cadence or anything else that you would kind of call out as we think about EBITDA flowing down through the year? 
Jeremy Johnson: No, I think ultimately, we've beat in Q1. We had a really solid quarter from a profitability side of things. I think 2Q always tends to come down a little bit from a profitability side. But ultimately, we remain confident in the full year and we flowed through that beat into our updated guidance. 
 And I think our overall adjusted EBITDA targets of 28% to 28.6% or 28.7% to kind of midpoint 28.5% or just under that a really good target for us to hit and push us toward that 30% kind of midrange target that we've set for 2025. And I think it's a nice stopping point along the way. So we're feeling pretty solid about that. And as I mentioned, it's -- it will take kind of a balanced approach here with -- as we get incremental flow revenue here. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question comes from Dan Jester with BMO. 
Daniel Jester: Maybe, Jeremy, to you, you called out kind of a few things about helping us think about the seasonality into the second quarter on the Dayforce line. Can you maybe just get a little bit more explicit about what you're assuming in terms of macro for the rest of the year? Any changes relative to how you guided last quarter for the full year? 
Jeremy Johnson: Nice to speak with you, Dan. I think ultimately, employment levels remain kind of in line with our expectations, which was essentially flat with normal seasonality. I think if you look at any seasonal impacts, we always see that typical Q1 to Q2 drop off with some of the year-end and print revenue in Q1 that doesn't happen in Q2. 
 And we do the seasonal volume in Q1 that, again, drops off or tends to drop off in Q2. It's something that's been with our business consistently, and you've heard us talk about this in the last couple of years, and we'll continue to talk through it in Q1 to Q2 dynamics. But for the rest of the year, no real changes in how we're guiding or any macro factors that would impact our guidance at this point. 
Daniel Jester: Great. And then maybe going back to the Co-Pilot and the comments about simple pricing. Maybe we could just expand on that a little bit more. I think one of the things many people are thinking about is about how do you manage sort of compute costs and margins and usage for some of these tools? And so maybe can you just help us think about how you're thinking about this for your customers and what does simple really mean? 
Joseph Korngiebel: Simply put, for Dayforce Co-Pilot, what we're doing is a per employee per month cost just like we do with the rest of our products. We can rationalize all the costs on what we're doing with the innovation that's happening with large language models and the like, but we're making it simple for our customers. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question comes from Alex Zukin with Wolfe. 
Aleksandr Zukin: I guess just maybe the first one. If we think about the commentary around bookings and kind of sales growth. As you now -- you're a month of the way through April, any commentary about pipeline conversion statistics or just sales growth exiting the month and how that's trending between kind of new versus selling into the base? 
David Ossip: April was a good month, come in slightly ahead of our plan. 
Aleksandr Zukin: Perfect. And then, David, you talked a lot about how Dayforce is becoming an HCM company and how much talent is kind of critical to that notion over the next few years. If you think about just the penetration rate within your customer base today, where you've sold kind of the most impactful pieces of that HCM portfolio in addition to payroll and time, what is that opportunity? How far through that are you? And how to think about that over kind of the next kind of year plus? 
David Ossip: We're in early stages. If you look at the average PEPM across our client base, you can still see there's quite a delta between the average PEPM price and between, I would say, our target price. If you look at the results with inside the quarter, both in terms of add-on sales back to the base and a number of full suite sales, you can see the numbers are very strong.
 What I can say is we did onboard a very strong client base leader in Q1, and we are seeing an impact from that already. We also have an overlay talent team now, and they are really doing tremendously. If I look at the results year-to-date, they've come in well ahead of schedule. And if you look at the customers that we actually pulled out, the 100,000 employee-plus grocery chain that has now purchased the full talent suite, where we are replacing one of the large ERPs with their talent suite across their entire enterprise talks about the strength, the capabilities and the viability of our talent components. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question comes from Bhavin Shah with Deutsche Bank. 
Bhavin Shah: Great. I guess, Steve, one for you and kind of dovetailing on that, just on a customer base motion, you guys talked about impressive stat. Can you just elaborate on the typical customer that you're able to upsell, Who are you displacing in terms of the talent suite? And kind of what are the other big opportunities outside of talent to kind of upsell into that base? 
Stephen Holdridge: So a couple of things. Yes. So one, I'll point out double down on what David said, is one of the things we did differently this year is that, that is a dedicated customer base motion versus an overlay motion. So we've invested in terms of the number of account executives and the focus on that. In terms of who we're displacing, it's all the usual players up and down the market, right? In the low end of the market, we're displacing the pays in UKG in the mid and upper end of the market, we're displacing the ERPs. 
 And we're displacing them because of the capability of our pay in time solution and the stickiness of that and the fact that our intelligence suite is now incredibly competitive, in fact, with the newest technology on the market. And as David talked about, this is around cost rationalization and the value of an entire platform with our talent is what's helping us win. 
Bhavin Shah: Super helpful. Just as a follow-up, David, to another question that Raimo asked on the macro. I know there's been some conversations with some potential digestion period for back-office software, just kind of post elevated spend as we exited COVID. When you speak to customers, do you see this at all? How would you kind of describe customer scrutiny and if it's changed at all in the past few months? 
David Ossip: Over the last 10 years, I can't say that there's really been an easy quarter. We now have, as you know, almost 6,600 customers live on the actual platform and every single one of those was a competitive RFP situation. When I look at the actual pipeline, and I would argue that under Sam's leadership, it's now a highly qualified pipeline. 
 The ratios are very good in terms of coverage to our target. And as Steve mentioned, the simplicity at scale message, which I spoke about earlier, which is the more automation and our ability to go to a customer clearly, identify on average about 12 different HR systems that they have in place, simplifying that to 1 Dayforce system that typically yields a subscription saving for the client in the very first year, plus they have much better automation, lower manual error rates, less FTEs, much more efficiencies around different types of workflows which also contribute to a very strong and quantifiable IRR on the Dayforce system. 
 And at the same time, we are able to significantly lift up the experience for their frontline workers, their managers and their executives all based on that single database that we have empowering Dayforce. And when you now begin to layer on what we're doing in terms of data and AI, the impact that we can have on decision-making and on both the top line and the bottom line of the organization is very impactful. And I would actually question that if it's not Dayforce, why isn't it Dayforce because we really do have quite a differentiated solutioning market. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question comes from Jared Levine with TD Cowen. 
Jared Levine: In terms of looking at your professional and professional services revenue and other revenue, can you discuss the mix of that currently that implementation related versus non-implementation related and how you would expect each of those to grow over the medium term? 
Stephen Holdridge: Yes, yes. And we think of that really in kind of 2 broad categories: implementation and then what we call value-added services around that. And with an implementation over time, we expect the core implementation to continue to decrease year-over-year as our partners move into that. The one exception is obviously, we mentioned with Government of Canada and we expect our value-added services and our focus on new and emerging products and supporting the SIs to increase. But with that, we also expect to see a continued slow growth in profitability as that mix increases as well. 
Jeremy Johnson: Yes. And Jared, maybe I'll add there. It's also inside of professional services and other gross margin. We have things like Cox and custom training revenue, and that will continue, and we still have a good opportunity to continue to grow that. And then the last thing I'll say is, as we move and continue to move into SIs, not all of that is on the SI's paper. Some of that is when we say SI-led, some of that is actually contracted on our paper, which means we've got to account for it under ASC 606 with a couple of 2 performance obligations and things like that. So I think just to clarify, I think that might be a misnomer out there. 
Jared Levine: Got it. And then Powerpay recurring ex float and Bureau recurring ex float both came in below your expectations for 1Q. Can you discuss what drove those lower-than-expected results? Is it more so of push out of revenue later in the year? 
Jeremy Johnson: Yes. I think we had -- we set some lofty expectations, I think, for Powerpay and on that side of things that the employment levels, I think, in Canada aren't as solid as we had expected. And I still think, in general, though, we grew that business by 8% in total or 5% excluding float. 
 So just slightly behind our expectations on that one. And on the bureau side, it's really about end-of-lifing products and migrating over into Dayforce. And that's really what you're going to see continued on that kind of other revenue line and we expect that to continue to decrease year-on-year. 
Jared Levine: Just a quick follow-up here, if I could. What is the updated Dayforce recurring ex float guide assumed for a bureau migration contribution there? 
Jeremy Johnson: I don't believe we've disclosed that specifically. 
David Ossip: It's immaterial. 
Jeremy Johnson: Yes. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. 
Mark Murphy: David, I'm wondering if you could give us your perspective on the labor market. When we look at non-farm payroll growth in the U.S. has slid from 5% a few years ago to about 1.8%, 1.9% range. Recently, I'm wondering because obviously, you're performing pretty well. How does that trend look comparatively within your installed base, do you think that might continue to grow at the low single digits for the time being? And then I have a quick follow-up. 
David Ossip: Mark, so I would say the volumes came in slightly ahead of what we had forecasted, and we're still seeing healthy employment rates at our customers. On top of that, I would point out again that part of our durable growth profile is the fact that we have a very strong employer of record and talent capabilities inside the system and our ability to go back to the base and do the add-ons to drive that cash IRR for our client does lead to consistent growth for our business. 
Mark Murphy: Okay. Understood. I wanted to ask as well, because we saw the comments on full suite bookings and add-on bookings, I think you said those trends were positive in April as well. I'm just curious, did you see a total bookings bounce back relative to some of the softness you've seen around the holiday selling season or is it still a bit of a measured buying environment out there as we've kind of seen across the broader industry? 
David Ossip: Yes, Mark, we saw that very early on in the actual year with January coming in very strong and as I mentioned, April came in ahead of plan as well. So we're pleased with sales year-to-date. 
Matthew Wells: Great. It looks like our final question will come from Kevin Kumar with Goldman Sachs. 
Kevin Kumar: In terms of the demand environment, have you seen any differences or trends that you would call out in the mid-market versus enterprise? Any color there would be helpful. 
David Ossip: In the mid-market, which we call major markets and as well in our enterprise space, which goes up to 12,000, what we are seeing is the simplicity at scale, again, that on average, 12 different systems to 1 day 4 system seems to be the kind of the theme in the market what we're hearing from both prospects and customers, they ask about more automation, less integration, less manual work, less FTEs, more efficiencies seems to be quite topical at the moment. 
Matthew Wells: Great. Thanks, everyone, for dialing in today. This concludes our call.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-07 00:00:00) =====
Operator: We have our CEO, David Ossip; and our CFO, Jeremy Johnson. We're also joined by our Chief Product and Technology Officer, Joe Korngiebel; and our President, Steve Holdridge. [Operator Instructions] 
 Before I hand the call over to David, I want to remind everyone that our commentary may include forward looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause Dayforce's results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as the cautionary statements in our filings. 
 Additionally, over the course of this call, we'll reference non-GAAP measures to describe our performance. Please review our earnings press release and filings with the SEC for our rationale behind the use of non-GAAP measures and for a full reconciliation of these GAAP to non-GAAP metrics. These documents, in addition to a replay of this call will be available on the Dayforce Investor Relations website. 
 And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to David. 
David Ossip: Thanks, Matt, and thank you all for joining us. Next to me, I have Steve who will review key customer go-lives and sales wins in the quarter. Joe, who will highlight platform innovation and discuss our acquisition of eloomi. And I'm delighted to welcome Jeremy back as our CFO. Jeremy will provide details to our quarterly performance and initial 2024 outlook. 
 Last fall, we shared our intention to transition from Ceridian to Dayforce with a goal to simplify and strengthen our brand and I'm excited to announce that our brand evolution is now a reality. As one United brand, Dayforce, we firmly believe that we can amplify our promise to make work life better. Today's new workforce is boundless, blurred, always on and borderless. Our changing world of work makes running and organization more complex than ever, and we're committed to helping organizations conquer that complexity. That's why we chose this moment to evolve and simplify our brand from 2 in the market to 1. We selected Dayforce because over the years, Dayforce has grown into a trusted global platform, setting a new standard for the human capital management industry. 
 Our customers know the Dayforce name to represent innovation, collaboration and transformation. The brand represents our future and we design everything for that ever-changing future together with our customers, helping them transform their organizations and set the pace for their industries. I'm incredibly excited and proud of the path I see for us ahead, united with one powerful brand that represents our products, company, community at their best. 
 Turning to our fiscal results. Total revenue was $1.51 billion and grew 23% year-over-year in constant currency. This was underpinned by the strong growth in Dayforce recurring revenue of 37% in constant currency. Dayforce recurring revenue ex float grew 29% ex float in constant currency and reflects the strong second half go lives, particularly of large enterprise customers, coupled with industry-leading retention rates and sustained employment volumes. Adjusted cloud recurring gross margins of 78.3% continued to expand, showcasing the scale and efficiency of our platform. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 27.1%, or $410 million reflects the flywheel of our cloud revenue and gross margin expansion, coupled with efficient OpEx and we had record operating cash flows of $219.5 million, a conversion of 54% from adjusted EBITDA that reflects our focus on driving our profit into cash. 
 Our customer base remains healthy and resilient. We ended the year with over 6.84 million employees live on the Dayforce platform, an increase of approximately 900,000 employees added year-over-year. Net go lives of large enterprise customers or those with over 6,000 employees, increased 64% year-over-year, demonstrating our ability to shift up market. Dayforce recurring revenue per customer of $147,000 was also up 21% year-over-year. And throughout the year, we also maintained our industry-leading retention rate of 97.1%. This is a metric I'm particularly proud of, as it showcases our ability to continually deliver value to our customers while helping them make work life better for their employees. 
 Turning to guidance. Our initial fiscal '24 guidance contemplates Dayforce recurring revenue ex load growth of 20% to 21% and since a normalized employee cadence covered with continued go-live activity across our larger customers. Adjusted EBITDA margin at midpoint of 28.3% assumes our continued expansion of gross margins in addition to onetime costs associated with our rebrand and the eloomi integration and conversion of adjusted EBITDA to operating cash flow is expected above the mid-50% range. 
 In summary, we had a very strong 2023, and I'm excited for the year ahead. I'd like to thank our strong community, our customers, partners and our employees, our daymakers. 
 Steve, over to you. 
Stephen Holdridge: Thanks, David. I am also truly excited for what lies ahead for Dayforce, our customers, our partners and our daymakers across the globe. Two weeks ago, we held our largest ever sales kickoff in Orlando, 800-plus attendees, 100 partner attendees, which was doubled last year, 10,000 hours of sales training, all focused on accelerating sales coverage and effectiveness in 2024. 
 Throughout the year, we continue to attach the full suite to nearly 50% of new sales. And today, 40% of Dayforce customers have adopted full suite. Add-on sales back to the base continue to trend in line around 30% of sales bookings, consistent with prior quarters. Dayforce Wallet also saw healthy traction with 1,150 customers live and 1,860 new customers added. Average wallet registrations continue to tick up now above 60%, along with healthy wallet usage of about 25x per month. We surpassed $3 billion in total Dayforce Wallet loads earlier this year compared to $1 billion at the start of 2023. 
 Last year, we brought in Sam Alkharrat as Chief Revenue Officer to take our sales function to the next level, and we are already seeing significant benefits from his leadership, including strong talent infusion, enhanced pipeline size and quality, improved conversion rates, deal execution rigor and stronger go-to-market alignment. However, we did also see longer sales cycles and more decision gates in Q4, impacting our sales performance relative to our aggressive goals. That said, in 2023, we saw a 50% year-over-year growth in pipeline generation. We entered 2024 with a record pipeline coverage ratio and started the year strongly with January sales ahead of our target. 
 Before I move to key sales and go lives, I'd like to also share the recent announcement from the government of Canada, that their extensive testing of the Dayforce platform has led them to conclude that Dayforce is a technically viable option for the next modern HR and pay system. This is another testament of the ability of Dayforce to handle complexity at scale and our multiyear partnership with the government of Canada. 
 Now turning to key sales wins from across the globe in Q4. Elior, one of the world's leading catering services companies with 90,000 employees globally has chosen Dayforce to support its U.S. and U.K.-based employees. Viva Energy, a leading convenience retailer, commercial services and energy infrastructure business growing to more than 13,000 employees selected Dayforce for full suite of HCM technology to support its growth in retail. A global designer and manufacturer of innovative furnishings and workspace solutions, partnered with Dayforce to transform payroll operations for more than 11,000 employees across 30 countries. A global sports fashion retailer with 75,000 employees expanded its use of Dayforce to include 21,000 employees in the U.S. An innovative and fast-growing electric vehicle manufacturer selected the full Dayforce platform to support 7,000 employees in the U.S. 
 Now turning to our record Q4 go lives, one of the world's largest global shipping and logistics organization with over 0.5 million employees completed its Phase I development to over 33,000 employees along with tax services for its entire U.S. employee population. A multinational manufacturer of consumer and industrial brands with over 50,000 employees successfully continued its Dayforce implementation, and is now live in 22 countries with 27,000 employees. A leading consumer goods company with 28,000 employees in 40 countries completed Phase 1 of its global Dayforce implementation with the deployment of workforce management and payroll in Hong Kong and Thailand. 
 A global European bank with 70,000 employees in 50 countries continued its Dayforce deployment to employees in the U.S. and Canada. Saber Health, a senior care service provider with 14,000 employees across the U.S. went live at the full Dayforce suite and one of the world's leading mining and infrastructure company with 13,000 employees being paid across the globe continued its multiphase global Dayforce implementation. 
 I'm now pleased to hand up to my colleague, my innovation partner, Joe Korngiebel, our Chief Product and Technology Officer. Joe, over to you. 
Joseph Korngiebel: Thank you, Steve. On the product front, we continue to invest in innovation that drives value through efficiency and productivity for our customers and their people. By leveraging the advancements around data and AI as well as delivering simplicity at scale, we released some key innovations in Q4 that provide quantifiable value for our customers. 
 First and foremost, Dayforce Co-Pilot, our generative AI assistant. It was delivered to our early adopter customers in Q4, providing dramatic improvements in the productivity of employees in answering common HR-related policy and compliance questions and in turn, saving valuable time for HR administrators. Dayforce Co-Pilot will be sold as a new product in our suite as an add-on to our core products of HR, pay, time, benefits and talent. 
 Next, HR service delivery. It's a new product that we released in Q4 and that is now in the hands of our customers by driving efficiencies with an AI-first approach to answering open tickets for employees. Our early HR service delivery customers are eliminating the cost of bolt-on, expensive point solutions and driving more value at Dayforce as a single robust HCM platform. 
 Now on to Dayforce Talent Marketplace, which was extended in Q4 for both internal and external talent efficiencies allowing greater flexibility to meet labor needs. For employees, we enhanced our shift bidding and shift trading capabilities boosting employee control over their work hours and allowing employers the ability to close scheduling gaps more quickly and efficiently. For the boundless workforce outside of your direct employees, we have officially launched our new ideal talent marketplace in Q4, which provides an on-demand, prequalified hourly workforce, enabling flexibility across a network of skilled employees when needed. 
 On scale of our industry-leading global payroll product, we have delivered our new horizontally scaled payroll as a service architecture. This empowers both our large customers with dramatic performance gains. As well as our small business Powerpay customers with a modernized payroll platform. On to mobile, and empowering the frontline workforce, which continues to be a powerful capability of our HCM suite, driving engagement and connectivity for employees. We have now reached over 1 million daily active users on Dayforce [indiscernible]. And our compliance leadership continues to grow as we closed out 2023, with an additional 36 countries and territories where our customers compliantly pay their workforce accurately with Dayforce. 
 Finally, I wanted to further highlight our acquisition of eloomi, which closed on February 1. This acquisition brings together an innovative team and product that is incredibly well aligned with our culture and our shared ambition to make work life better for our customers. This partnership supercharges our Dayforce learning and talent products, extending our leadership in compliance with industry-leading learning management capabilities combined with an engaged learning experience platform to ensure employees stay current and compliant. Also in frontline workforce enablement with mobile micro learning for training and people development and an AI innovation with generative AI learning content offering and personalized learning paths. 
 In addition, we will also be adding several new products to Dayforce with the assimilation of the eloomi technology. And that includes Dayforce learning content, which offers prepackaged, curated learning content that targets compliance, industry and geographic needs with one affordable subscription. And also a brand-new product, Dayforce employee communications, delivering a mobile-first experience with real-time chat, collaborative communities and up-to-the-minute news feed for Dayforce. That's a quick look at some of the innovations in Q4 and our recent investments in innovation. Now over to Jeremy to talk through the financials. Jeremy? 
Jeremy Johnson: Thanks, Joe. It feels good to be back. I'm proud of the way our team closed out the year. In Q4, we delivered Dayforce recurring revenue ex float growth of 29% on a constant currency basis underpinned by strong Q4 enterprise go-lives and healthy underlying customer trends. Tax modernization contributed about 440 basis points of growth as we completed the transition at the end of the year. 
 Adjusted cloud recurring gross margin of 78.1%, expanded 190 basis points year-over-year as the Dayforce platform continues to scale. Adjusted EBITDA of $99 million or a 24.8% margin expanded by 470 basis points year-over-year, reflecting the timing of OpEx investments in addition to incremental brand spend. Operating cash flows of $90 million in Q4 benefited from strong operating income and working capital trends. 
 On the full year, we delivered 54% conversion from adjusted EBITDA or $219.5 million. All in, this was a successful quarter and year. We brought live some of our largest customers to date while delivering healthy top line growth and record operating cash flows. Our cloud revenue growth, expanding gross margins and consistently high retention rates showcased the strength of our financial model. 
 Turning to guidance. In the first quarter, we expect Dayforce recurring revenue ex float growth in the range of 20% to 21%, both as reported and at constant currency. Total revenue is expected to grow 14% to 15% both as reported and at constant currency, and adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $123 million to $126 million or at 29.3% margin at the midpoint. For the full year 2024, as David previously mentioned, we expect Dayforce recurring revenue ex float growth in the range of 20% to 21%, both as reported and at constant currency. This reflects sustained employment volumes for the first half of the year balanced by a more conservative second half of the year. 
 We have reflected eloomi in this guidance, assuming approximately 150 basis point contribution to Dayforce recurring revenue ex float growth in 2024 and 100 basis point contribution in Q1, reflecting only 2 months of ownership. Float revenue guidance of $174 million for the full year reflects a moderating rate environment throughout the year. Total revenue guidance for the full year is 14% growth as reported or 13% to 14% growth at constant currency. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year in the range of $480 million to $495 million or 27.9% to 28.6% margin. This range includes incremental headwinds from eloomi and the Dayforce rebrand totaling approximately $15 million. Additionally, we expect operating cash conversion from adjusted EBITDA to in the mid- to high 50% range for the full year. 
 Before we break into Q&A, I'd like to provide an update on 2 items. First, in conjunction with our rebrand to Dayforce, we made the decision to terminate our frozen defined benefit pension plan. If you recall, this was a legacy pension plan that Dayforce inherited from Ceridian and its predecessors. We expect this termination process to take 15 to 18 months and conclude in 2025. 
 As a result of this termination, we expect to see some financial impacts to our 2025 numbers, specifically a cash charge in the range of $15 million to $25 million to fully fund the plan and cover termination expenses. And in 2025, we'll also incur a noncash charge to reflect the termination of the pension plan. We do not expect an impact to adjusted EBITDA margins either in 2024 or 2025. 
 And second, the modernization of Powerpay is well underway and we now have our first Powerpay customers using Dayforce embedded payroll engine as their calculation engine. This enhancement will provide Powerpay customers with access to new features and functionality with a more robust platform and while we're very excited about this transition, we do not plan to reclassify Powerpay revenue to Dayforce, simply given the different customer profiles between Dayforce and Powerpay. 
 As such, we will continue to disclose Powerpay revenue separately for financial reporting purposes. And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Matt to begin the Q&A portion. 
Matthew Wells: Thanks, Jeremy. I'd like to remind everyone 1 question and 1 follow-up, please. We have a pretty healthy audience today. Our first question comes from Kevin McVeigh with UBS. 
 We'll circle back. Scott Berg with Needham. 
Scott Berg: Congrats on a good quarter. I wanted to start on a question regarding the longer sales cycles comments. I guess can you help break that down a little bit in terms of what you saw? Was this just a couple of deals that pushed maybe from Q4 to Q1, it was a significant amount of deals. You obviously called it out, so it was a little bit material, but I just wanted to try to think about the impact on both the year? And then was that the primary benefit for the January outperformance versus your plan? 
David Ossip: Thanks, Scott, and nice to speak with you. First of all, it has no impact on our fiscal '24 guide. What we did see was a slightly more decision gains in Q4 coupled with probably fewer days with inside the actual month. Christmas vacation, as you know, started a bit early this year relative to the past. When we look at the start of the year, as you pointed out, we had a good January, it came in above our internal expectations for that particular month. And we also entered the year with almost 2x the coverage that we had at the beginning of last year. I don't believe that there is any change in the macro quarter-over-quarter. And we are obviously going into this year quite optimistic about the forecast for sales. 
Scott Berg: My follow-up is actually for Jeremy, welcome back, looking forward to working with you more here. You come into the CFO role with a unique view. Obviously, I've been with the company for an extensive period before. But how do you think about driving additional efficiencies and maybe leverage in the model versus your prior experience with the company. Is there anything that you think about doing maybe differently in the current position of CFO than maybe did before that might be interesting for investors to think about here going forward? 
Jeremy Johnson: Yes. Thanks, Scott. It's good to talk to you again. And as I said, it's good to be back. It does kind of feel like coming home here, especially with an executive team that I'm largely familiar with, the finance team that I know the key players very well, all the Board and investors that I also know really well. So look, I think there's a number of levers that we have to continue to grow this business. I think since I've been gone, I've been very impressed with some of the big rocks that the company has moved. We've dramatically moved up into the enterprise space, and we called out some of the metrics there where we've increased our go-lives and enterprise customers 64% year-over-year. We've talked about partnerships and some of the progress we've made with global SIs there. And I'm also thinking about global expansion, and we've done some amazing things in the APJ and EMEA region. 
 I think we've got a lot of room to continue to expand profitability at this company and conversion into cash flow. And that's really where I'm going to spend my time focusing on is maintaining growth, making sure we invest the right amount to maintain that growth, but also making sure that we continue to improve the cash flow position of this company, and you saw us make some really great moves there this year. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question comes from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. 
Sitikantha Panigrahi: Great. And Jeremy, welcome back. So it's good to see this 20% plus kind of growth guidance for your organic Dayforce recurring. That's probably -- you're growing faster than other payroll peers. So my question is like you have been adding so many modules since IPO, and even Joe's team relentlessly kept on adding more features there. So how big is this growth opportunity to now cross-sell these modules to your base to deliver the sustainable growth? And what's your go-to-market strategy to go after the base because most of them are displacement opportunity. So you have to displace the existing vendor. 
David Ossip: Thanks, again. Great to speak with you. It's a very valid question. So when I look at the overall company, what I can say is that our client retention rate is probably several percentage points higher than anyone else in industry, including the ERPs. It's 97.1%. When we, though, look at our sales back to the base, as a percentage, we were quite low relative to industry. So this year, we brought on a very senior leader to head up the customer-based sales team, and we're expecting to take the sales back to the base, up by about 5%, relative to last year. 
 So it's definitely a focus that we have at the moment. One other clarification that you might have. When you look at the Dayforce recurring revenue growth year-over-year, you must remember that last year, we had a tailwind of about 500 basis points from the movement of the tax business. This year, you have it effectively in the denominator in the reverse. So if you actually -- if we had not migrated the tax, which we did obviously for accounting reasons, you effectively would be a few percentage points higher, probably around 23% on an organic basis. 
Sitikantha Panigrahi: And just a follow-up. If I look at Q4 [indiscernible], that's kind of this organic Dayforce recurring revenue growth came in line with expectations. Is there anything you want to point to -- is that the employment level or any go live? Also, if you could touch upon your so many large deals was scheduled to go live. Any update on that? 
David Ossip: Look, as you know, we guide very narrow. [ Say ] you expect as we get to the end of the year, the numbers should come within guide, which it did, which I think is a reflection of a well-managed and very predictable type of business. As Steve called out, we were very happy with the go-lives that we saw in the quarter. In fact, they came in ahead of what we had internally budgeted. It's also impressive given the fact that we now have at least half of the deals that we're implementing run by the system integrators where they're priming actual implementations. And that, I think, is a reflection on the robustness of the software that it's not only us that can implement that we're finding that our system integrated partners are able to implement and to implement predictably be on time, which I think is a very good testament. But Jeremy, anything else that you'll call out. 
Jeremy Johnson: I think you said it nicely. The only thing I'll add is you saw us increase guidance across throughout the year in Q2, Q3. So I think we feel really good about the quarter that we had. And coming in line with guidance, I think, is on a tight metric like that speaks to the visibility that we have into the business and the accuracy of the model. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question comes from Dan Jester with BMO. 
Daniel Jester: Maybe a couple for Steve. First, can you maybe double-click on any of the go-to-market or partner changes that you're really excited about for 2024 and then secondly, I appreciate the update on the government of Canada process. Can you give us an update in terms of the road map for next steps as they assess Dayforce more broadly? 
Stephen Holdridge: Yes, happy to answer both of those. Let me start with your second one first. So Government of Canada is a significant step. They put it out in a press release. They have determined that our solution is technically viable, which is a result of many multiple years of a pilot proving it at all sorts of complexity. The next step is a continued process on that. I don't want to get too far ahead of where they're at, but we're continuing to work with them to define what are the next steps in rolling that out over the next couple of years here. 
 In terms of the go-to-market, so nothing dramatically changes in tune of it. You heard David talk about really 3 things, one, continued focus on our customer base and how we service the customer, how we take advantage in terms of our high retention rate to focus on the customer base team and the amount of investment we're making in innovation in the product. We believe that's an incredible growth source for us. Secondly, we've continued to increase the sales capacity and knowledge, and we continue to refine around our go-to-market in terms of understanding the places where we have the best right to win and making sure we're adjusting and surging sales resources where we tend to win. We tend to find we're winning more upmarket. We're winning global, and we're winning in terms of compliance, in terms of product satisfaction and in terms of full suite. 
Daniel Jester: And then maybe a quick one for Jeremy. On your commentary about a little bit more conservatism in the back half of the '24 guidance. Can you just elaborate on that a little bit, what's driving that conservatism? And if there's anything you'd call out from a seasonality perspective as we think about the quarters for '24. 
Jeremy Johnson: Yes. Good to speak with you again, Dan. The comment in my scripted remarks was specifically around employment levels and employment levels moderating in the back half of the year. Visibility there is probably where we have, obviously, the least. And so we're being a little bit more conservative on expecting any upside there. As you know, I talked about this before, but we have a lot of visibility into our numbers as we head into the year, and we feel confident in our guidance. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. 
Mark Marcon: Jeremy, great to work again with you. Looking forward to that. I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit more about one of the newer modules. The HR service delivery. Sounds like it could be really promising. Can you elaborate a little bit there in terms of which point solutions you could be going after? How big you think that TAM is? And what characteristics does the Dayforce HR delivery model have that is superior to some of the incumbents that are out there that have been doing relatively well. 
Jeremy Johnson: Mark, good to talk to you again, and thank you for the question. HR service delivery has grown as is important to the overall HCM suite to deflect questions and provide a knowledge base so that customers can get their questions answered when they have questions around their employment when they have HR policy questions or compliance-related questions. And so it has grown. There are a handful of point solutions that have grown over the last decade in the HR space. And traditionally, it was a bolt-on. 
 The hard thing about that was employees didn't know where to go to get their questions answered. There was different technology solutions, and they wouldn't have a streamlined user experience and so the delivery of that product, especially now for us with the advancements in AI and being able to surface answers quickly and effectively to employees is proving to be a really important differentiator for us. A lot of companies who did it in the past leveraged a traditional just search model and search can only be so accurate. And so technology has really provided us a boost in terms of what we can do to see that, not really adoption customers that took the product in Q4, highlighted that for us. 
 So we see it as a key add-on that almost every one of our customers will want. It drives efficiency in a world of efficiency right now for our customers. It makes their employees, especially the HR administrators that are highly paid and need to really manage their time effectively in this world of change. It drives efficiency and productivity into that level of their workforce. And so we're really bullish about what it's going to provide as far as an add-on module. We're seeing the uptake in Q4 is as an example of where we're going is to be quite high. And it eliminates, like I said, that need for the complex integration, the expense of these point solutions that were widespread and they were really bringing down a lot of the efficiency of the workforce. 
David Ossip: Marco, one thing in terms of advantage, other relative to the others. The central part of our experience to employees and managers is the Dayforce Hub experience, which in itself is a content management system, which means that as organizations build their hub experiences by loading up documents, say, for example, opportunity policy to the actual platform, we can index it immediately and make it available through what we call intelligent search. And through the intelligent search, if someone were to say, "hey, can I take this amount of time if the search doesn't respond with the sufficient amount of information," we can create that service ticket for the individual. And so I do think from an integration perspective or experience perspective,  the fact that we are one with the employee model, one with the actual experience gives us a leg up relative to the competitors. 
Jeremy Johnson: The single experience is really powerful to highlight David's point to. And when you add on what we're doing with Co-Pilot, you can actually refine your question down, and you're seeing that over and over again from our customers, wanting to leverage technology to drive efficiencies and productivity in the workforce. 
Mark Marcon: That's terrific. And then with regards to a couple of things that you mentioned earlier. With regards to the government of Canada, I think at one point, you mentioned rollout over the next 2 years. So are we to take -- are we to take that comment that essentially, not only are you technically viable, but there is in fact, a plan to roll you out over the next 2 years? And would you get the entire government. And then is there anything that you can tell us about the big logistics company that you've signed up and that you've started up in the U.S., any big learnings there that will position you to continue to gain some of those really large enterprises. 
Jeremy Johnson: So a couple of things on Government in Canada. I want to be careful we don't get ahead of where we are. It was a 2- to 3-year process to go through an intense evaluation for us to be determined technically viable, which is significant. We are in the process of defining the next steps in rollout. Over the entire government, it will be more than a 2-year process on that. And the time line that is still under discussion. And there's obviously funding and other political things that need to happen for that. But we're very positive with where it's at and it's a significant next step. 
 Secondly, I guess, learnings in terms of logistics company, we talked about them and others key wins before is we are understanding and improving the ability of the product to scale, right? And while this first phase was a chunk of it, we're well in terms of the second phase, which is going to be significant. We're looking at accelerating that. And thanks to Joe and what his team has done, we're really demonstrating that our ability to scale and the things that Joe talked about, our reality and are creating a level of confidence in a customer like this who you know will exercise and test us at the highest levels. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. 
Raimo Lenschow: I have 2 quick questions and congrats from me as well. First one is on the customer addition this quarter. Obviously, you're moving up market a little bit. So there's going to be like a -- there's going to be fewer customers that you're kind of dealing with compared to the past. But then you also talked a little bit about like longer deal cycles. Can you just put it -- frame it in terms of how much of that number was kind of driven by a change in strategy versus like the market? And then I have one follow-up, please. 
David Ossip: So Raimo, remember it's a net ad. As you know, we are focusing on the larger customers and included in the base of customers going back to about 2018 and before. We had a large number of Powerpay payroll customers using Dayforce or workforce management. And these are very small customers. And so we are seeing churn at the small end of the customers partially by design as we continue to focus upmarket. 
 In terms of the quarter and the elevated sales cycles, I'm not ready to say if it is macro elongated cycles or just how the days of the week fell into some in December, coupled with an earlier Christmas break, where we had several days fewer than we normally have if you go through the end of the year. And as I mentioned, we got off to a very strong start in Q1. And when I look at the pipeline development that we did over 2023, which was a key priority for us. We see that reflected in the almost 4x to 5x coverage relative to our sales targets of this year. Historically, we would have gone in probably around 2 to 3x. So I think the macro is still there. I think customers are still buying et cetera. 
Raimo Lenschow: That's really helpful. That's really good to hear. And then one follow-up from me is -- if you think about -- are there any differences that you see at the moment as your sales leaders are discussing the year with you in terms of U.S., Canada versus kind of Europe, Asia in terms of like what demand signals you're seeing there just to get a better idea in terms of how the global economies are playing out for you? And then lastly, Jeremy, I'll come back and looking forward to working with you. 
David Ossip: No. Look, I think we have a very strong opportunity in APJ in Asia Pacific and Japan, and actually I was there last week. And when I look at our footprint in market, it is quite remarkable. And in total, we have about 1,500 customers in region of which we pay almost 2 million people in terms of regular pay slips. By the way, those 1,500 would not be included in the Dayforce counts that we have. And the customers that we have there are the best of the best. The breakfasts and the lunches and the customer meetings I had really speak about the potential that I do think we have inside that region. 
 That said, when we look towards our 2024 plan, I think it's largely in line in terms of a global distribution with prior years, but we do have a lot of global capability. And when I do speak to customers or to the large SI partners, one thing that is called out consistently is that we're able to deliver strong local payroll in a lot of different countries. And as well, we're able to offer a very strong global payroll across all the countries that customers have. And that does differentiate us quite significantly from any other player, whether it be HCM, payroll or ERP. 
Jeremy Johnson: Yes, I would just add one thing to that is, our growth levers remain the same, and we have the advantage of a balanced portfolio approach to how we drive our sales, right? Significant push in growth in terms of global. We are #1 in terms of that and customers recognize it. You've seen the growth in enterprise, but we still have a very healthy mid-market business and the differentiation around full suite across that. We still -- you talked about the fact that the customer base motion. You heard the stats in wallet and other things around adjacent innovation. 
 So as we take a look at the year, each one of those levers has a growth target assigned to it and we see a pretty even distribution of the portfolio. And one of the advantages in our go-to-market as things change in different geographic or macro conditions, we can adjust those levers and continue to drive a number. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel. 
Brad Reback: Great. Thanks very much. Jeremy, as you think about your guidance philosophy going forward. Can you give us a sense of how that may have differed, if at all, from previous CFOs? 
Jeremy Johnson: Brad, good to speak with you again. The answer to the question is really no changes. The guidance philosophy I have is generally going to be consistent with the way we've guided in the past under previous CFOs. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question comes from Jared Levine with Cowen. 
Jared Levine: In terms of the demand environment in 4Q and so far into 1Q, have you seen any differences based on employer size, geography, vertical or even payroll versus workforce management? 
David Ossip: Not really. I don't think so. Look, a lot of it depends on how we basically set our priorities in terms of Steve says, balance across the different segments we play in and the geographies. We know that we still have a tremendous amount of white space just in the U.S. and Canada. And so we are still quite focused on what I call the domestic market, just amount, given the amount of growth potential we still have early here. But I can't say that I'm seeing any global market kind of stand out either positively or negatively. 
Jeremy Johnson: Yes. We see growth across all of them. David talked about APJ. I'm with our team in Europe and we have a number of significant brands over the past couple of years that we sold that are helping us there. But no, I think just go back, we have the advantage of a balanced portfolio and the ability to grow from multiple levers and to any time adjust up or down in those levers based on what's happened in a particular economy. 
Jared Levine: Great. And then in terms of upsells and targeting an increasing mix of bookings related to upsell. Do you anticipate that to be pretty broad-based across payroll versus your other modules as you roll out more native payroll functionality. You anticipate the mix of upsells related to payroll to change over the medium term here? 
Jeremy Johnson: I think there's really 3 key focus areas for upsell with our existing base. One, customers that we have a footprint in a particular region and moving them to global. We're finding even small mid-market companies are pulling up shared services centers. #2, customers that have time and pay with us to full suite with all the investments we've done in terms of talent, HR service delivery, there is a significant push in that. And then secondly, different divisions and distributions where we have one division in the company and cross-selling to another division as part of a larger global multinational. 
 I'll just complement that with our approach on the product standpoint. We have an industry-leading payroll product. It's a global payroll product that's differentiated. You heard from David, you heard from Steve in terms of whether it's APJ or across the globe, handling it both locally and then being able to handle a global footprint. We often times lead with that you can land and expand with Dayforce. 
 We started Dayforce with an industry-leading WFM product. It's a product that is differentiated to extend in different industries and to do that hyper effectively. We oftentimes lead with that product as a best-of-breed WFM solution and we land and expand and can grow our footprint. And now with the eloomi acquisition, you can see what we're doing in talent, a really powerful frontline workforce with an AI capability that really provides industry-leading talent capabilities. We can lead now with talent and you can land and expand with the compliance solutions that we have that are leading around WFM and payroll. And so we're really coming at it not just as a full suite, which we, of course, now have a very robust full suite. We can give you best-of-breed capabilities in those 3 areas and then land and expand with our customers. And in a world of efficiency and productivity needs, it's turning to be a good strategy. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question comes from Steve Enders with Citi. 
Steven Enders: Okay. Great. Maybe just to start, it seems like as we think about the model moving forward and the pace of net new go-lives that maybe we should expect that level to be a little bit lower just given some of the dynamics. I guess I just want to clarify that and how you're thinking about what the pipeline looks like for go-lives going through calendar '24. 
David Ossip: So that metric is a -- it's not a simple metric. The better number to look at would be the number of employees that we're onboarding on to the actual platform. If you look at '23 to '22, we added about 900,000 people on to the actual platform. In the net number of customers that are live, there are a lot of customers that are not included in that number because we've tried to keep the number consistent in the way we did it at time of IPO. So I think Jeremy will have to determine what we actually disclosed on a go-forward basis when it comes to that metric or employee volumes. 
 In terms of our go-to-market strategy, we remain committed to focus in on the markets where we believe we have differentiation. When I look at the actual product, what we do exceptionally well, we deliver simplicity at scale, where we're able to solve very complex problems for our customers especially around the payroll workforce management scheduling benefit side. While at the same time, simplifying the number of different vendors that they're dealing with to get a complete and powerful total human capital management experience. 
 That means that largely you'll see us continue to go up market to play very successfully in what we describe as the enterprise space, that 3,000 to 12,000 employee mark and as well in the major space, which goes from about 1,000 employees up to about 3,000. When we go into the very large enterprise, we are now seeing core HCM suites in particularly where there are high percentages of front-line workers. So think retail, for example. In other industries, we typically focus on our compliance modules, our global payroll and global workforce management capabilities, which, as you know, are quite unique in market. 
Jeremy Johnson: And if I can just add 3 things that I think have really strong metrics for us that we've talked about already, but I'll highlight them again. We had record go-lives this past year in Q4, that's on a dollar basis metric. We have maintained our world-class retention rates of 97.1%. And we had net adds for our enterprise customers up 64% year-over-year. So larger customers record go-lives and strong dollar-based retention, I think are the 3 metrics that I want to highlight here. 
Steven Enders: That's helpful. A couple of context there. And then maybe just on the partner feedback and the potential customer feedback you've heard so far on the name change to Dayforce. And I guess, what has been the commentary that you've heard so far? 
David Ossip: One, I'm very proud of the work that our brand new team did. I'm seeing tremendous excitement both in [indiscernible] and from the simplification of the actual name change interest has been very, very positive. 
Matthew Wells: Arvind, I think you're going to have to mute but if you'd like to ask a question, this is Arvind Ramani with Piper Sandler. 
 Next question, Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. 
Mark Murphy: Yes. Wondering if you can drill down a bit into what you're expecting for migration tailwinds in 2024, David, I think you mentioned the tax modernization side, but I'm interested also in the international payroll migrations. Should we think that the tax migrations fade off somewhat while the international payroll piece perhaps starts to pick up and make up some of that difference. And then I have a quick follow-up. 
David Ossip: So the tax migration, as you know, there was a platform change onto the Dayforce and so largely driven by accounting reasons. In terms of the APJ migration, we are now beginning to target what -- there's a product in market called Preceda particularly in the Australian marketplace. And we are actively speaking with the Preceda customer base about their journey towards Dayforce. I had a lunch with many of them just last week. We have several that have completed the journey and are highly referenceable. 
 So I'm optimistic that, that journey will go very well. Likewise, we're actually focusing on simplification across the other countries within APJ, the launch of Dayforce Unify, which gives the customers a consistent experience when we incorporate what I call the headless payroll engine that we have across multiple APJ countries. That's also launched and also going quite nicely. And then over time, you'll see the expansion of Dayforce native as we go into 2025 and 2026. 
Mark Murphy: Okay. Understood. And then as a follow-up, perhaps for Jeremy, it is great to have you back, of course, Arithmetically, is it correct that the float income guidance steps up slightly for 2024? And if so, mechanically, could you just remind us how that works? And are you factoring in an expectation of for some pay cuts in the spring or summer? 
Jeremy Johnson: Mark, good to speak with you again. And thanks for the question. Yes. So float, it steps up slightly from -- in our guidance compared to where we ended the year. We ended the year at around $169 million, and our guidance was $174 million. Essentially, what you can assume there is balanced growth offset by essentially flat rates. Now keep in mind, we have baked in rate cuts throughout the year into this number. But the way we ladder our portfolios, the rate cuts won't really hit this year. They'll start to hit next year or towards the end of this year and not impact that average rate that we're seeing. 
Mark Murphy: Okay. So something like a 6- to 9-month lag because of the laddering. 
Jeremy Johnson: So maybe a little bit longer than that, but something like that. 
David Ossip: So Mark, if you look at it last year, our yield was effectively 3.74%. And this year, we're assuming about 3.75%. So it takes a bit of time to have the rate increases go through the system. We're still climbing the yield curve when it comes to the core portfolio, that's part of the portfolio that we lever out. in Q1, the proportion between the short term and the core portfolio shifts more towards the short term. So we should see some benefit from a higher rate environment in Q1 relative to last year. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question comes from Kevin Kumar with Goldman Sachs. Our next question comes from Bhavin Shah with Deutsche Bank. 
Bhavin Shah: Just first on Dayforce Co-Pilot. I think you talked about in your prepared remarks about the strong productivity improvements from some of the early adopters. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about monetization of the SKU? How much is based on productivity and kind of how that pipeline is faring for this offering? 
Jeremy Johnson: Bob, good to talk to you, and thank you for the question. We see it as an add-on to our suite. And so when you look at our overall suite, whether it's core HR, our compliance modules of payroll workforce management or what we're doing in talent and analytics, we feel like Co-Pilot is, as we refer to as an AI teammate for your global workforce. It can help you in terms of efficiency, quickly, easily get your -- the questions you have answered, it's also moving into action work where it can automatically generate reports instead of having to work with IT to create reports or get the data you need out of the system. It can do it more instantly and it's a nice add-on. 
 So we treat it as any module we have, you can add on Co-Pilot for an additional charge and drive those efficiencies. With our early adopters now, we're monitoring that efficiency and really driving that so that we can then, in our go to market later this year, really drive that into the metrics that we provide for customers to upsell and see what labor increases they can see and what productivity increases they can see from their workforce as a result of using Co-Pilot. So it is an add-on module that you add on to a subscription, whether you just buy payroll or you buy our full suite, it can be added on as an additional cost saver for your business. 
Bhavin Shah: Super helpful. Just one quick follow-up based on I guess, more for Jeremy, just based on kind of -- you noted in the guidance, it assumes a more moderating rate environment. Obviously, it's lighter, so the impact can be more in, I guess, '25. But how are you as a management team thinking about just the rate and pace of investments to the extent we are in a lower price environment. Does that kind of impact how you're thinking about investing into go-to-market, et cetera? 
Jeremy Johnson: We always look at the float as a really nice piece of our business, and we'll take it when it's here. But as it goes away, it's something that we will continue to invest in the business. We'll also focus on expanding our adjusted EBITDA margins and the conversion of that into cash flow. I think maybe what I'll highlight there is we saw significant improvement in our operating cash flow and conversion from adjusted EBITDA into operating cash flow. So we ended the year at $219.5 million in operating cash flow which is a 54% conversion from our adjusted EBITDA. So we're really pleased with that, you'll continue to see us focus on profitability regardless of the rate environment. 
David Ossip: The other thing that I'll mention is if I look at the EBITDA, which came in, as you know, the 27.1% for the full year, ex float, that was up by 340 basis points year-over-year. So while we did get benefit from the float, we did continue our focus on, as Jeremy pointed out, more efficient OpEx across the company and as well the cash conversion. We were very happy that we came in a 54% conversion of operating cash flow, EBITDA as operating cash flow. And when we look at our guide for 2024, we're looking at increasing net buy by approximately another 10% up to the high 50% range of cash flow conversion. 
Matthew Wells: Thanks, everyone, for dialing in today. This concludes our call.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-11-01 17:00:00) =====
Matt Wells: Good morning and thank you for joining. Welcome to Ceridian’s Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. I am Matt Wells, Head of Investor Relations. And on the call today, we have our Co-CEO, David Ossip; our CFO, Noemie Heuland; our Chief Product and Technology Officer, Joe Korngiebel; and our President of Customer and Revenue Operations, Steve Holdridge. [Operator Instructions] Now before I hand the call over to David, I want to remind everyone that our commentary may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause Ceridian’s results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission such as the cautionary statements in our filings. Additionally, over the course of this call, we’ll reference non-GAAP measures to describe our performance. Please review our earnings press release and filings with the SEC for our rationale behind the use of these non-GAAP measures and for a full reconciliation of these GAAP to non-GAAP metrics. These documents, in addition or a replay of this call will be available on the Ceridian Investor Relations website. And with that, David, I’d like to turn the call over to you.
David Ossip: Thank you and thank you all for joining us today. Today, I will discuss our strong third quarter results highlight our commitment to continually innovate on the Dayforce platform and provide an update on our raised full year outlook. Steve will provide more information on sales wins and successful customer implementations. Joe will highlight key announcements out of INSIGHTS, especially our gender of AI co-pilots autonomous payroll service desk delivery and other items that we discussed at our INSIGHTS conference. And Noemie will add detail to our quarterly performance and updated full year outlook. In the third quarter, I am pleased to report that we again exceeded guidance across all revenue and profitability metrics. Dayforce recurring revenue grew by 35% year-over-year at constant currency and we are pushing the full beat and incrementally raising our revenue and profitability guidance for Q4 and for the full year. Before I go into the financial details, it’s with mixed emotions that I shared the news that Leagh will be leaving Ceridian on 10 November to become CEO of Cooper Software. If you recall, 5 years ago, I brought Leagh on board to bring structure and to build processes to scale and deliver durable growth. During our time together, we have delivered and the results speak for themselves. Our revenues have doubled and will surpass $1.5 billion by the end of this year. Our customer base has grown as well to over 6,300 live customers, including some of the biggest organizations in the world and adjusted cloud gross margins have expanded meaningfully from 67% to over 78% today. And in terms of scale and structure, we now have an exceptional leadership team, including Steve and Joe, whom you will hear from today. I and this best-in-class team are committed to the continued success of our people, customers and business. Therefore, I’d like to express my gratitude to Leagh personally, although bitter sweet, I am delighted and proud of her development as a highly regarded leader in the cloud domain. She now has the chance to take the reins at Cooper and her appointment is truly well deserved. They are fortunate to have her at the helm. So, from all of us, Leagh, congratulations and thank you. Now, let’s turn to our financial results. In the third quarter, on a constant currency basis, Dayforce recurring revenue grew 35% and Dayforce recurring revenue ex-float grew 29% year-over-year at constant currency. Adjusted cloud recurring gross margins of 78.3% expanded by approximately 350 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $107.2 million or 28.4% of revenue and expanded 827 basis points year-over-year. This margin expansion reflects revenue upside, a greater share of recurring revenue in the business and continued scale across the Dayforce platform. And as I mentioned earlier based on our Q3 performance and increased visibility, we are raising and narrowing the range of our growth and profitability outlook for 2023. This reflects the full flow-through of the beach in Q3 and an incremental raise into Q4 and the full year. Noemie will dig into the guidance details shortly. Other highlights of the quarter included another record break in INSIGHTS, where we had a record number of attendees, including customers, prospects and partners. And we showcased meaningful product innovation across the Dayforce platform, which Joe will discuss in a few minutes. Notably, we announced that Ceridian is becoming Dayforce. This decision reflects who we are today, an enterprise-grade full suite human capital management company. This will unify our industry-leading platform with our brand and further advance our shared ambition of making work life better. And just last week, Gartner named Dayforce for the fourth straight year, a leader in their Gartner Magic Quadrant for cloud HCM suites for 1,000 plus employee enterprises. This recognition validates Dayforce as a continued leader in cloud HCM and shines a light on the positive experience millions of Dayforce users engage in daily. I am so proud of this achievement. As the results show, we have momentum. We are well positioned to execute in the current macro environment and deliver durable and profitable growth. And with that, let me ask Steve to speak to the customer and market highlights. Steve, over to you.
Steve Holdridge: Thank you, David. First of all, I continue to be impressed by the momentum of our sales team, now led by Sam Alkharrat as our Chief Revenue Officer. Sam has fully settled into the role and is driving best-in-class demand and sales execution across the go-to-market organization. We now have the largest and most qualified pipeline in our history, a byproduct of this focus across sales, marketing, partners and our highly referenceable customers. Year-to-date, we brought live 353 net new Dayforce customers. This number reflects a cohort of large deals going live in Q3 and is consistent with our strategy of shifting up market. For context, net go lives of Dayforce customers in our enterprise segment are up 75% year-to-date and notably, gross revenue retention remains in line with historical trends in the range of 97%, where over 30% of annual contract values from add-on sales consistent with our focus for some time now to sell value back to the expanding base. And year-to-date, we have attached the full suite to nearly 50% of new sales. This is validation of both our sales and products strategy. We are seeing continued adoption of our talent solution while the Dayforce Hub experience also resonates with customers. This means 40% of our customer base is now full suite showing we continue to help customers understand and adopt the full value that Dayforce can bring as organizations transform to the new world of work. Dayforce Wallet also continues to see healthy adoption across our new and existing customer base. We are attaching the solution to approximately 80% of new sales. We now have 1,765 customers sold and over 1,065 customers live on wallet. And notably, we crossed $2 billion in total customer loads in Q3 with customer year-to-date loads on the card, well over $1 billion. Moving now to a sample of key wins and go-lives from around the globe. In Q3, new customer wins included one of the largest supermarket chains in Canada selected Dayforce to support 125,000 employees across 1,500 retail locations. A global European bank with 83,000 employees upgraded its payroll technology by extending its use of Dayforce to India, which will bring in an additional 20,000 employees onto the platform. A Lithuanian group of supermarket retail chains with 38,000 employees across 5 countries chose Dayforce for core HR and workforce management in Lithuania and Latvia. And some of the organizations that went live on Dayforce in Q3, a leading global customer service organization with 82,000 employees in 45 countries expanded its current Ceridian partnership by adding employees in Kenya on the Dayforce for core HR, time and attendance, recruiting, onboarding and self-service. A global analytics professional services company with 35,000 employees in 40 countries recently, we have live with Dayforce HR and payroll for 17,000 employees in the U.S. A chemical and ingredients distribution company with 17,500 employees across 72 countries launched Dayforce in the U.S. and Canada, allowing it to streamline 26 different pay cycles across 12 separate systems into a single platform for this region. And when we talk about wins and go-lives, we must also spotlight the role of our partners this quarter. Who, as you know, are an important part of our growth strategy. We continue to see our partner network expanding and thriving, including 250% plus year-over-year growth in SI partner-led RINs across all regions and segments and look no further than the enhanced presence of our partners at our INSIGHTS conference to showcase how we continue to leverage and expand the breadth and depth of our ecosystem for the betterment of our community. This quarter demonstrated Ceridian’s ability to ride the macros well and delivered value to customers. As a company, we are leaning into our ability to serve customers as the go-to partner for HR transformations around the world growing durably, profitably and sustainably. And we are seeing our focus on quantifiable value with Dayforce as the global people platform, translate into results across all areas of our business. And I know it’s the same on the product front, where we’ll now hear from our Chief Product and Technology Officer, Joe Korngiebel. Joe, over to you.
Joe Korngiebel: Thank you very much, Steve. Yes, on our product and innovation front, we recently shared some key announcements around our industry-leading Dayforce HCM Suite at our annual customer conference INSIGHTS. These announcements focused on four areas of planned innovation, greater intelligence, stronger compliance, better experiences and a more open and connected Dayforce platform. We have been delivering on these themes and announce the following. First, Dayforce Co-Pilot. Yes, a Generative AI assistant that transforms work by automating repetitive tasks and dramatically enhancing Dayforce by helping employees get work done faster and also enabling them to drive better decisions into their business with real-time data informed INSIGHTS. You see through our partnership with Microsoft and their connection to open AI, we’re able to deliver this to our customers in early access today. That’s right. We’re delivering on the promise of AI with our customers and what it can do to drive efficiency and productivity today, and we will release more-and-more capabilities over the coming year. Next, we announced Dayforce Autonomous Payroll. This is in a major enhancement to our already industry-leading global payroll product. It removes the need for a lot of manual identification of data airs and anomalies that payroll administrators suffer with. It offers these administrators the ability to run payroll completely instantaneously. You see it leverages our continuous calculation engine. This allows autonomous payroll to run simulations on payroll constantly during the pay cycle. This gives advanced notice to those payroll administrators on potential issues that may arise and really leverages that power of data anomaly connection and AI to cut through the complexities that face their business. This is enabling our customers to be efficient and more productive in entirely new ways. We’re excited to introduce this to our customers with availability in the first half of 2024. Finally, I want to talk about Dayforce Exchange. This is a key area of innovation across our entire ecosystem. It ties together our customers, our users, our partners together with all of our Dayforce experts. You see this exchange is a one-stop shop for organizations to access a rich library of content solutions and integrations. This leverages our entire ecosystem to help make Dayforce better for our customers. We will again be delivering this in the first half of 2024. All of this momentum, including our placement as a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant that David just spoke about reflects our ability to go where customers need us in this time of efficiency and productivity. It allows to Dayforce to be the engine behind their change. It also highlights our ability to be nimble and agile in the face of what’s going on with technology and workforce changes. Our announcements of Dayforce Co-Pilot and the ability to interact with our customers and innovate together, highlights this, agility and nimbleness. Dayforce is continually becoming a trusted partner for our customer that can help in this world of change. And for us, staying focused on delivering quantifiable value for our customers by providing simplicity for their people operations at scale is what is differentiating us and driving us in the market. With that, let me hand over to Noemie to close this out.
Noemie Heuland: Thank you, Joe. I’m happy to report that all key Q3 metrics exceeded guidance and we are raising Dayforce recurring revenue ex float, total revenue, float revenue and adjusted EBITDA to reflect the full beat and an incremental rate. When we issued our fiscal year ‘25 financial targets, we said our margin profile would expand as a byproduct of the revenue mix shift towards recurring, especially cloud recurring and the scale of cloud gross margin through delivery of efficiencies and product automation. I am happy to report we continue to deliver on that promise with the share of cloud recurring on our total revenue being 80% in Q3 up from 73% last year. In addition to adjusted cloud recurring gross margin expansion of 350 basis points over the same period. The scale of our cloud business coupled with disciplined and spend across the organization drove significant profitability expansion in the third quarter as evidenced by the adjusted EBITDA beat. Year-to-date operating cash flows of $130 million are up 43% year-on-year. And this increase in cash flow is primarily driven by continued scale in the business. While there was exacerbated seasonality impacting Q3 cash flow, we continue to expect approximately 50% conversion of adjusted EBITDA into operating cash flow in fiscal year ‘23. Turning to Q4 and fiscal year ‘23 guidance. We’re adjusting our Canadian dollar outlook in Q4, resulting in a $1 million to $2 million incremental headwind across Dayforce recurring and total revenue. Of note, after accounting for this incremental FX headwind, we’re still raising our fiscal year outlook for Dayforce recurring revenue ex float above our third quarter beat. In the fourth quarter, Dayforce recurring revenue ex float is expected to grow in the range of 29%, 30% at constant currency, reflecting another strong quarter of go-lives, durable customer base and typical seasonality of employee volumes at the end of the year. Float revenue guidance of $39 million reflects a relatively stable yield and average balances as compared to Q3 incrementally impacted for a weaker Canadian dollar. Total revenue in Q4 is expected to grow 18% to 19% at constant currency, reflecting strengths in Dayforce recurring revenue. As we continue to build our partner and SI ecosystem, we expect our professional services revenue to moderate accordingly. The knock-on effect is a greater share of recurring revenue, helping drive margin expansion as we’ve seen throughout the year. As such, we expect full year ‘23 adjusted EBITDA margin to expand to 27%, up from 20.1% in fiscal year ‘22. Timing of spend with Q4 being typically our largest sales in go-live quarter, is driving quarter-over-quarter seasonality in Q4 adjusted EBITDA expected to be in the range of $97 million to $99 million, reflecting the trends I previously highlighted. Now a couple of words on the brand and its financial applications, as David mentioned earlier, Ceridian is becoming Dayforce. We do not anticipate investments in the Dayforce brand to affect our path to fiscal year ‘25 margin targets. And we plan to amortize the Ceridian tree name over a 2-year period effective August 2 of this year. This amounts to a non-cash operating expense of approximately $21 million per quarter in G&A or $14 million for 2 months in the third quarter. With clear visibility into our 2025 targets of $2 billion in revenue and 30% adjusted EBITDA margins, we’ll continue to execute as we head into next year with more granular details around 2024 guidance when we report in February. With that, Matt, I’ll turn the call over to you for Q&A.
A - Matt Wells: Thanks, Noemie. Our first question will come from Mark Marcon from Baird.
Mark Marcon: Good morning. And thanks for taking my questions. Can you hear me?
David Ossip: Yes, Mark. Good to hear from you.
Mark Marcon: Great, thanks, David. Hey, congratulations to you and the entire team on the very strong quarter. I have two questions. The first one, it was really nice to see the upside from a revenue perspective, but even more upside with regards to the margins. And I’m wondering if you can give us a little bit more deconstruction with regards to the source of the margin upside. We basically ended up having a 2% beat on the top line and almost 20% beat in terms of adjusted EBITDA. And so I’m wondering, are there any things that are unusual, anything that we should think of with regards to the future? That’s the first question. And then the second question, David, relates to Leagh’s departure, I’m wondering if you can talk a little bit. I mean, congratulations to Leagh obviously, becoming CEO of Coupa is a desirable position. But I’m wondering, you’ve had so much success in terms of selling to larger enterprises on a global basis that takes a big team effort. How should we think about the sales cadence and the impact of Leagh’s departure on some of those big enterprise sales?
David Ossip: Great. Well, Mark, thanks for those two questions. So on the first, what you largely are seeing is a shift of the revenue mix more towards the high margin recurring revenue. And if you look at the total results, you’ll see we vastly outperformed on the Dayforce recurring revenue. And as Noemie pointed out, we’re moderating the implementation side as we shift more and more implementations to our system integrator partners. That obviously drives a much stronger overall margin on the business, and you see that reflected in the considerable beat in the adjusted EBITDA margin. On a go-forward basis, I would expect that to continue. And as you know, we’ve given guidance to exceed a 30% margins in the near-term. Regarding Leagh, what I’ll say about this is Leagh joined the organization 5 years ago to bring really process and structure to the organization and she definitely delivered on that. We now have – I would argue, the best team in the industry. In terms of sales, Sam is fully up to speed. Steve mentioned that in his actual talk. We also have really the entire team – really what I call profession expert in terms of the enterprise and into the large enterprise market. I’m obviously very, very confident, and I’m obviously personally very committed to the business.
Mark Marcon: Great. Thank you very much.
Matt Wells: Our next question comes from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho.
Siti Panigrahi: Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on a good quarter and also guidance. David, I want to ask you in terms of demand environment, what are you seeing at this point? And how is the pipeline looking for mostly your enterprise deals? It was very impressive last two quarters. So any color on that and also the go live of those large deals?
David Ossip: The pipeline this year has grown quarter-over-quarter. We go into Q4, and I expect it will go into fiscal ‘24 with a record pipeline.
Siti Panigrahi: Anything on the go live?
David Ossip: On the go-to live side, it’s tracking, I would say, according to plan. You see that reflected in the guidance and obviously, the raise of the actual guidance. What also with the actual go-lives, you’re actually seeing a shift to larger accounts going live, which I think we communicated earlier in the year. So a slight mix, if you look at the overall customer base, obviously, towards the larger scale customers.
Siti Panigrahi: And one follow-up, David. Lately, we have started getting questions from investors about the growth opportunity for payroll sector. So how do you see about – I know you don’t guide for next year, but when you look next year in here, what are the different growth drivers you’re thinking in midterm? And is this the typical question is it a 20% grower. So any comment on that would be helpful.
David Ossip: Look, we’ve given near-term guidance towards the $2 billion mark by 2025. We’ve also spoken about the 30% EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and 80% gross margins. We believe we’re on track and will be consistent with that. I think we’ve been very good in giving near-term guidance to the actual marketplace. If I look towards next year, I’d expect us to be in the rule of 45% or so. And so you can kind of do the math to do the actual components on that. In terms of the payroll sector, I actually haven’t seen a change in the payroll sector. I think it actually is still very healthy. I think there is a lot of land for us to grab as we go forward. I’d also like to point out that we are a human capital management company, and we now have well over 20 different modules that are available to our customer base. And as well, we’ve invested on the global cycle quite some time where there is even more land to actually capture. So in terms of durable growth, I think we will be consistent in terms of our performance, and we will keep focusing on our five growth levers that again, we’ve been very consistent since 2018.
Siti Panigrahi: Thanks, for the color, David.
Matt Wells: Our next question comes from Scott Berg of Needham.
Scott Berg: Hi, everyone. Nice results during the third quarter. Thanks for taking my questions. I want to start on the company’s involvement in its partner ecosystem. I think one of the things that’s come up really positively in my recent round of checks is outside of just bringing them more implementations, your engagement with them is, I guess, increased nicely over the last year, and I think they are more helpful in some of your deal opportunities. Can you help talk about kind of maybe what’s really gone right in your engagement with partners or what’s improved over the last couple of years, in particular? And how should we think about those opportunities as you go forward?
David Ossip: So thanks, Scott. What I would say about that is I think we have had a high degree of integrity in the conversations with our system integration partners. As you know, we’ve been developing in the SI channel for several years now. When we actually look at the number of deals kicked off within the quarter, I believe, Steve, we’re over 50% now. And when we actually go to market, we’re positioning the SIs first in terms of doing the actual implementation. To Mark’s question earlier, one of the reasons that you’re now seeing us increase on the EBITDA side is as the revenue shifts more towards the recurring revenue as opposed to the services side, you get into a higher profitability revenue stream. And remember, we are a cloud software company, not a cloud services company, which is, I think, very important to note. In terms of the SIs, we’re very proud. If I look at insights and many of the people on the call here did attend insights. We had a record number of partners attending and very engaged. And if you went to the expo hall, you could see that their particularly exhibits were very, very busy with our customers and with our prospects, which bodes very well. We’re seeing them influence the actual deals in a very positive way, and we obviously are seeing some positive impact in terms of pipeline as well. And in terms of our global aspirations, it’s very, very important that we have the global reach of our SI partners which are both the Tier 1 partners who have global, if you like, employees, but also the local regional partners is also very helpful to our business. Steve, anything you would add?
Steve Holdridge: Yes. I think the one thing, Scott, and David hit on it, is our design of the program was collaborative out of the gate. We have the opportunity that we didn’t have such a large dependency on that services revenue that we don’t compete, but we can collaborate. And in fact, in addition to recommending deals, we are putting together go-to-market strategies with our partners where we support them. Secondly, a significant investment in enablement of our partners, both in terms of sales enablement and enablement and product and their contribution of the road map. So I think if you talk to our partners, they will say that the program and the experience they have had with us surpasses what they have had with the other players in the industry.
Scott Berg: Understood, thank you. Very helpful. And then from a follow-up perspective, the largest survey in the HCM space recently had kind of talked about some slowing spend around additional module adoption just in the space as a whole. And it’s really more reflective of normalizing the pre-pandemic levels after seeing maybe a bolus last couple of years. You’re getting 50% of your new customers to attach the full suite today which is obviously an impressive number. But how do we think about kind of in the pipelines going forward, what you’re seeing maybe in the next couple, three, four quarters? Do you expect attach rates or cross-sell opportunity to be kind of in line with recent trends? Or are you seeing also a change that might be representative of what the survey highlighted. Thank you.
David Ossip: So Scott, we’re actually leaning into add-on sales towards the customer base as we go into next year. And remember, we’re certainly in place a structure for the business, not just to hit the $2 billion number, but really, we’re now beginning to target the planning and the structure we need in place to hit the $4 billion mark later on. And obviously, add-on sales and expansion of the actual platform has to be a big part of that. The modules that we see are being purchased are those that you would expect, which are more of the critical types of modules, so very high attachment rates around things like recruiting. Obviously, the compliance modules are always in high demand, and we are the leader in that regard. Steve, what would you add to that?
Steve Holdridge: Yes, I would agree. And in fact, in our go-to market next year with our sales plan, we are doubling down on attachment. We are putting specific motions around our talent suite. We are putting specific motions around other areas. And in fact, we think that there is white space for us to have increased the percentage of add-on sales to the customers.
Matt Wells: Our next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Mark, we can circle back later. Steve Enders with Citi.
Steve Enders: Okay. Great. Thanks for taking the questions here. I guess, so I was wondering if we could maybe get an update on the Canadian government opportunity? And if there is a – I guess, any changes there from the last earnings call update.
David Ossip: Thanks, Steve, we’re progressing quite nicely with the Canadian government, the results have all been very positive. We’re now in the waiting cycle for them to go through their internal procurement processes. Steve, what would you add?
Steve Holdridge: Yes. No, we continue to be very engaged with them. We’re in the planning of what a rollout would look like, and we continue to be very bullish on the opportunity. Obviously, we’re dealing with government and decision cycles that move at a certain pace, but everything continues to be positive.
Steve Enders: Okay. Great. Thanks for the update there. And then maybe coming off of your conference and all the AI announcements that you made there in other product announcements, I guess, what’s the feedback been from customers and prospects about how they are thinking about AI adoption and the kind of core use cases that they are targeting for it?
David Ossip: So I’ll start, and I’ll hand it off to Joe. There is just a tremendous amount of excitement. What I can say about insights and the products that we showed is that they are real and that we are doing delivery of generative AI with INSIGHT the product and it’s really pervasive across the entire platform. So in terms of leading, I think we’re way ahead of anyone else in the actual industry. Joe?
Joe Korngiebel: Thank you for the question. Without a question, we look at our brand promise, make work life better. And what we’re doing with AI in general, but specifically with generative AI, it’s starting to do that. What we highlighted at our user conference was the ability for your administrators to create reports instantly in a lot of enterprises, there is only a few people that can write reports to get the data out of your systems. And those reports come every other Friday because of backlogs in IT. What we’re starting to do with our customers is looking to them what’s going to make a meaningful difference in help with the efficiency and productivity of their people staff and things like are automatically generating reports and being able to give instant access to data, it’s providing value. So the reception we heard from our customers at INSIGHT was one of really collaboration and promise to help them in this time of efficiency and productivity. And so whether it’s the co-pilot capabilities on our report writer and analytics, whether it’s what we’re doing with Autonomous Pay and taking out some of the inefficiencies that happen in some of the people, processes and people operations. So it was incredibly warming to connect with our customers. And most importantly, like David said, we have an advantage with some of the technology choices that we’ve made in our architecture, which is a single data platform that’s allowing our customers to really invent and co-create with us today. And so we’re starting to really listen and give that feedback today. So quite promising, and I’m incredibly bullish about the transformation that’s happening in our industry.
Steve Enders: Okay, perfect. Thanks for taking the questions.
Matt Wells: Our next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies.
Samad Samana: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats to the strong results and Leagh, congrats on the new opportunity. It sounds incredible. David, no one knows the HR payroll industry as well as your just for a few people like you. Wanted another company in the ecosystem last night noted that increased automation and improving the payroll rides is creating a significant revenue headwind for them as they improve the payroll process. I think one of the big questions we’ve got from investors for Ceridian and every other company, frankly, in the industry is, is there a significant amount of fee revenue or subscription revenue that’s generated by having to either rerun payrolls or fixed payroll errors or whether it’s filing in their own categories? And does Ceridian have a revenue stream that’s associated with that? And maybe just how should we think about automation and the impact on a revenue stream like that. I think it would be very helpful for everybody listening with somebody like you that’s payroll industry stalwart to illuminate us on that?
David Ossip: Let me just begin by saying this. We’re a cloud human capital management company, and we don’t charge on batch processing. And I suppose for the kind of batch-based payroll companies or the legacy types of companies that used to charge on the payroll run process, which I guess is what they are doing in payroll controls or something like that. It’s a very archaic way of actually charging it isn’t how I would think of any cloud company actually charge in inside. I didn’t fully understand the other competitors or other players a dialogue in terms of automation I think when they talk about automation, they are talking about employees being able to view their pay slips online which I would think would be a base capability of a payroll system. And I can’t see how that should impact the revenue of a company. In terms of us, we’re going the other direction. We’re beginning to use now generative AI and autonomous payroll whereby we can make the payroll processes even more efficient. The entire continuous calculation engine was all designed around delivering efficiencies, 80% to 90% of time reduction across the payroll team, and we’ve been very successful since the start of depots and focusing on that. When we talk about innovation, we talk about making work life better for people. We talk about expanding the product across the full human capital management. We’re talking about real innovation into it. So no, we do not have any, as I’d say, sensitivity to batch-based process and processes impacting our revenue. That would be crazy.
Samad Samana: Great. I really appreciate that. I think that was an important topic to address for a lot of investors that are keenly focused on that. And I want to shift back to Ceridian and your key strategic initiatives. I’m curious maybe on the Wallet side of it. I know that you guys get some updated metrics, but how should we think about the traction towards the company’s targets that you’ve previously talked about there? And any puts or takes that have maybe changed the trajectory for better or for worse, especially as we think about maybe what’s going on in the broader macro environment? And thanks again, David.
David Ossip: Yes. The one is on track, will hit the ARR number that we spoke about previously. If I look at registration rates are now above 55%. We’ve also seen the percentage of eligible people kind of go up quite nicely as well. We’re about to release some new capability on the Wallet and around instant transfer and peer-to-peer transfers that will come out probably in Q1 of next year. If you look at the App Store, you’ll see the rating on the round the Wallet is exceptionally high. Steve spoke a bit about the actual amount of money that’s moving through the wallet, which is very helpful. We’ve also got the ability now to do direct deposit for customers that our employees that are not eligible for on-demand pay. So again, a very good program executing as planned.
Samad Samana: Great, thanks. Congrats on the strong quarter.
Matt Wells: Our next question comes from Bhavin Shah with Deutsche Bank.
Bhavin Shah: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, David, first, just on Autonomous Payroll or some of your generative AI announcements. Can you just maybe elaborate a little bit on how you’re thinking about monetization of both these services?
David Ossip: So, one, I think it will increase our win rate as we actually go forward. There maybe a possibility for us to actually increase the platform fees. So, we are going through the sensitivity analysis of that right now. We do believe that we will have a lead in the industry when it comes to generative AI and the copilots that Joe showed at INSIGHTS. Joe, anything that you want to add?
Joe Korngiebel: Yes. In general, Co-Pilot itself will be an additional product in our overall product suite. And so you can really enhance the productivity and the effectiveness of your employee by giving the ability to make tasks, complete faster. We demonstrated examples of being able to automatically send notifications to employees and managers when they need to close the end of a quarter or so or end of a pay run. We demonstrated what we can do to have questions answered simply to not backlog your people operations department with a bunch of the same questions being asked over and over again. With what we are doing where you can ask a simple question in natural language, get that answer. It will self-learn from itself. And so then the next question that comes in gets answered instantly and quickly instead of having to answer the same question multiple times. So, these type of efficiencies we see as a powerful way to enhance your employees, and we are looking to monetize that by saying, yes, you can have our core suite and you can add on top of it our Co-Pilot as a SKU and provide even more efficiency and productivity. So, you will start to see that as new SKUs showing up in our overall product suite as another important vector in terms of what we can grow from a revenue standpoint.
Steve Holdridge: And this is Steve. Just to add on that. From a go-to-market, it’s very simple. We believe the business case and value of what we have seen come out of generative AI will easily command a premium price in the market and companies will flock to it because of the savings and efficiencies they will get out of it.
Bhavin Shah: Very helpful. Just clarifying, will Autonomous Payroll be a separate SKU? Will that be included for all kind of Dayforce customers? And my second question is just in terms of just Dayforce recurring customer, saw a pretty nice uptick this quarter with accelerating growth from the last few quarters. Can you just talk about the drivers of that?
David Ossip: Well, the drivers of that, obviously, is the widening of the actual product suite and the back at 50% of the customers I will take in the actual full suite. In terms of packaging and bundling for next year, we are still going through that exercise at the moment. Joe, anything that you would add in terms of Autonomous Payroll and ability to charge for it?
Joe Korngiebel: Yes. I think an important point on the previous question that was asked as well is we are delivering and really transforming payroll. We are delivering modern payroll. And both Autonomous Payroll and what we are doing with wallet are the key components of that. And while we are finalizing the package you can see our offering very different than what the competitive landscape is where people are still clinging to printed checks and things. We have a new revenue driver and wallet is a great example. We have a new really revenue driver in global payroll growth and being able to be a global payroll provider to pay your people no matter where they are in the world in this new boundless workforce. And so we really take Autonomous Payroll. What we are doing with wallet and what we are doing with core global growth is what companies need for modern payroll, and we are leading the charge with really and disrupting ourselves in many ways by providing this next generation of payroll to really help companies and the changing workforce and the changing nature of business.
Bhavin Shah: Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the strong quarter.
Matt Wells: Okay. Great. Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.
Mark Murphy: Thank you so much and congratulations on a very differentiated performance. David, you are currently onboarding, I believe some of the largest customers that you have ever landed in terms of seat counts. Can you comment on how the system scalability is performing under that pretty heavy transactional load? And just how you feel about that massive onboarding process here into Q4 and beyond?
David Ossip: Yes. Thanks Mark. I am going to ask Joe to speak about the hyperscale payroll project that we have been doing over the last probably about 18 months. But at a high level, it’s going very well. Joe, do you want to just talk a little bit about hyperscale containers versus servers?
Joe Korngiebel: Yes, for us, to grow up market and to really push was one of the big reasons that I came here 3 years ago, and we have been really fundamentally changing our architecture. One, we started with data. Data is essential in terms of getting it right and having a single architecture to that. The second is horizontal scale, just moving in a vertical scale, the world has limits and has shortcomings. And so as we have gone live, we have taken our payroll capabilities, and I mentioned continuous pay, we are doing that as a payroll engine that can run horizontally. And so we can just – with our partnership with Microsoft and what we are doing with the Azure cloud, we can just spin up new containers and be able to run larger and larger customers. And that’s being paid off by exactly what you said, Mark, new customers going live. We are running them into what we refer to as our payroll engine as a service, running it horizontally at scale. And then scale also equals a complete change in user experience to do proper hyperscale, you need to change user experience as well. And over the last several years, we have been working on a complete new user experience that we are driving in to help customers with the scale and the user experience side as well. So, both of those factors, both the horizontal scale as well as the overall user experience have been in the works have been rolled out for the last several years, and now we are seeing it light up with these large-scale customers are going well.
Mark Murphy: Yes. Thank you, Joe. That’s very helpful. I appreciate that. David, I wanted to ask as a quick follow-up. Just given Q4 is your largest quarter for sales and bookings activity, it sounds like that’s been progressing very well. Can you comment on – you did comment on the pipeline, but could you comment on the business confidence you are seeing out there. For instance, our inflation and higher cost of capital affecting the psychology out there among prospects, or the new bookings patterns at all, or are you seeing ongoing health into spending mood?
David Ossip: Mark, we have always taken the approach of a very strong return on investment to our customers. And today, when you are talking about a 5% Fed rate and money is no longer free, the time to return is very important. We have always led the industry in terms of how quickly we can deliver a return to our customers. It’s making us much more competitive against the ERPs were not any are we very strong on the ROI side, but the customers, by the time they go live, which as you know is quite quick with us, are fully proficient with the actual system right away, which allows them to get a stronger return. The second part about it as well, as we broaden our platform, there is a considerable saving to new customers to buy additional modules at the time of purchase because they don’t have to pay for another database, another hosting environment and the integration that goes between systems. So, the system simplification ties into the very strong ROI. In terms of pipeline, as I mentioned, at a record level, but I also have to point out that Sam is up to speed and really is tremendous. And so that gives us a lot of confidence in the remainder of the year. And as I have said earlier, we are very focused, as you know, on the 2025 target of the $2 billion, 88% gross margin, 30% adjusted EBITDA and I think we will deliver on that.
Mark Murphy: Thank you very much. Congrats again.
Matt Wells: Our next question comes from Dan Jester of BMO.
Dan Jester: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just two ones. So first, on the full suite purchases, great to see the continued momentum there. I think my understanding is that full suite doesn’t necessarily mean everything that Ceridian makes. And so if you look historically, has the propensity of the full suite buyers to come back to you and buy additional modules over time like analytics and the like. Is that higher than the customers that maybe only buy one or two things out of the start? And then my second question, David, you gave some updates earlier this year about using generative AI within the organization to drive efficiencies and margin. Any update in the learnings as you have expanded maybe some of those trials? Thank you.
David Ossip: Yes. So, look, as Steve had mentioned, we are doubling down in terms of add-on sales next year in terms of the actual sales force. So, we do believe that there is a great opportunity for us to widen the use of the actual product with our customers. Part of our pricing strategy is actually focusing on the right modules for the customer at the time of an initial purchase so that they can get that very strong ROI and the quickness of ROI, which allows us to go back to them after the fact with the next set of, if you like, products. Again, it allows us to price optimize quite nicely from that regard. In terms of the use of generative AI with inside our internal operations and as well across our customers, it’s very similar in terms of thinking. When we look at the customer support side, we believe that we should be able to drive 10% efficiencies through the use of generative AI. We have spoken about the tool that we have actually built at INSIGHTS. We actually showed through the intelligence search and the Co-Pilots, we are now able for administration of users to ask questions, how do I do this, or what does this mean with inside the system. And the Co-Pilot is able to actually help the user through the administration of the actual product. That’s a form of self-service, which allows them to get quicker responses, but also reduce the inbound calls to our support team, driving that efficiency. Steve, anything you would add on that?
Steve Holdridge: No, I guess and in fact, I think we are ahead of the industry in terms of that. We are seeing real results on that. And to David’s point, we are seeing the benefit of both reduced inbound, but we are also seeing a better customer experience and an increase in our EPS based on that because customers can get to their answers quicker. And you will see us as we lean into that turning that into a more proactive outreach is not only helping customers respond, but proactively providing customers guidance to things before they ask a question.
Dan Jester: Great. Thank you.
Matt Wells: Our next question comes from Kevin Kumar with Goldman Sachs.
Kevin Kumar: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. It’s great to see the progress in EBITDA margin, which has grown nicely this year. But curious on cash flow margin, which has expanded a bit slower, so can you give a bit of color on how you think about the levers that can help drive better EBITDA conversion into cash flow over time?
Noemie Heuland: Yes. And we have talked about the drivers for enhanced profitability, which I think is one of the primary driver going forward. You will see us also continuing to shift the revenue from lower margin into recurring and within recurring into cloud recurring. So, as we migrate the customers over from legacy platforms into Dayforce, you will see corresponding expansion of profitability that will translate into cash flow generation as well. Specifically for Q3, we had a little bit of favorability in AR, which is driven by billings, very much back-end loaded in the second half of September. We have collected those billings, but that’s primarily the difference between the 50% that we have guided on average and the number that you see for Q3, but we remain committed for the conversions we have outlined for the remainder of the year.
Kevin Kumar: Thanks. That’s helpful. And then maybe just one on Dayforce Wallet, I wanted to ask about the traction in the European market. I think it’s been out for over a year now. And so just kind of curious on overall reception with clients in international markets relative to the U.S. Thank you.
David Ossip: Sure. So, international markets, I am assuming that you view Canada as part of North America, so I will talk about the UK. The UK, we have a slightly different model. It’s a cabin model because there isn’t the interchange in the UK market. We have seen good adoption across the customers in terms of the actual – in terms of the wallet there are no the real surprises or, I would say, differentiating patterns with North America.
Kevin Kumar: Thank you.
Matt Wells: Our next question comes from Alex Zukin with Wolfe.
Alex Zukin: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on another solid quarter. I guess I wanted to ask to my first one is around how well it seems like you have been executing and performing actually in the mid-market. Our checks suggested that you are seeing some pretty interesting tick-ups in win rates. So, maybe just any changes to the competitive landscape there? Any plays that you are doing that are working, or anything that’s changed there head-to-head versus the competitors?
David Ossip: Yes. Look, the mid-market for us, remember, is probably enterprise for almost every other player outside there. We find that in what we call the major market and the Enterprise segment, we are seeing more full suite deals. And the work that I think Joe has been doing over the last 3 years in terms of really lifting up the user experience, working on the actual data and the AI side and really broadening in deeply in the talent offerings that we have. Some of the experiences that Joe and I was in the product are just absolutely beautiful. And so when we actually go out, can we show the actual demonstrations, it just shows very well. And then on the other side of it, we have so many case studies now of very strong returns of investments across our customer base. And the last factor would be the system integrators that we discussed earlier on we have really taken an approach that SI Prime first to market. And obviously, we can do that because the product is robust and third-parties can administer the product as well as our own internal services, which I think is also just a very, very good factor. But yes, we have noticed that as well.
Alex Zukin: Perfect. And then, David, I guess, to the construct of some of these very large logos that you have been announcing even as late last year and even this last couple of quarters, if you look at your press releases, there are multiple logos that have tens of thousands and sometimes even hundreds thousand plus employees. But un are not landing all of those employees right away, and you are not landing the entire suite in those logos right away. So, I guess the question I wanted to get a better idea for is, as I look at the opportunity for Ceridian’s expansion notion within those larger customers, specifically, like if you look at the construction of your growth for maybe next year or 2025, how much is going to come from net new versus expand within existing customers?
David Ossip: So, remember, we have five growth factors. One, acquire new customers, new logos. Two, expand the number of modules that are used by each of the actual clients. Three, the enterprise. Four, go global. And five would be the wallet types of products. One change that we have actually seen, I would say, over the last year, maybe 2 years, is a number of these very large logos are actually buying multiple modules from us, not just payroll and time. So, if I look towards the large grocery chain, that really was kind of a takeaway from an ERP and a takeaway from one of our competitors at the same time. Where it is more than just a pair on the time side, there is a very high usage of the hobby experience, the analytics side. And I do think there is a strong potential to expand that footprint. If I look at one of the very large that we did out of the UK, that was actually a full suite HCM deal or the very large enterprise side. So, there is a lot of white space for us in market, a lot of land grab to be had, whether it would be in the major space, large enterprise, global, expanding the actual product side, and it ties down to that general theme of durable growth for the business.
Joe Korngiebel: And one other thing I would add to your point is on some of those large logos that we expanded, you are correct. That’s a multiyear rollout for them. And that’s another reason that gives us confidence in our long-term view because we have very clear line of sight not only to current year but 2-year and 3-year revenue streams as those phases come live, and we have shown our ability to execute against that.
Alex Zukin: Perfect. Congrats guys.
Matt Wells: Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Hey Raimo, we will circle back. Our next question comes from Matt Pfau with William Blair.
Matt Pfau: Hi. Great. Just wanted to ask on global payroll adoption, and any metrics you can give in terms of how that’s impacting interest or demand for Ceridian. And then also, I know you were testing a new payroll engine in the Middle East? Just wondering how that deployment model was progressing.
David Ossip: So, in terms of global, it is a very strong differentiator that we have in the marketplace. It’s one of the reasons that we are getting more of the wins in what we call the major markets. And the Enterprise segment, it’s not just a large enterprises that have global footprint. I think the work that Joe has been doing in terms of the net payroll engines, the global payroll interfaces really does differentiate us quite significantly from the people in the marketplace.
Matt Pfau: Great. Thank you.
Matt Wells: So, our next question will come from Michael, Wells Fargo. Okay. Raimo, we will circle back to you here, otherwise, Robert Simmons with D.A. Davidson.
Robert Simmons: Thank you. Do you hear me?
David Ossip: Yes.
Robert Simmons: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering first, could you update us on the ideal marketplace. So, it’s a pretty differentiated idea really you have to go in there, but so I am wondering kind of how the progress is coming along.
David Ossip: Yes. It’s going really nicely. For those of you who came to INSIGHTS, we actually had that on the main stage. We also did a number of breakouts around it. We have the first customers now actually going live on the ideal talent marketplace. By end of year, I think we will probably have three customers using the actual product which would be kind of the completion, if you like, of the charter pays. And then going into next year, we will start building out the go-to market properly. And I would expect by the end of the year, it should be coming along.
Robert Simmons: Got it. Great. And then any updates you can give us on the CFO search. How close are you to you find somebody? And what would be your ideal candidate?
David Ossip: Yes. I think we are progressing very nicely. We believe that we should have a candidate announced by the time or by the start of the year.
Matt Wells: Thank you, Robert and thank you everyone for joining us today. This concludes our third quarter earnings call.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-08-02 17:00:00) =====
Matthew Wells: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining. Welcome to Ceridian Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Matt Wells, Head of Investor Relations. And on the call today, we have our co-CEOs, David Ossip and Leagh Turner and our CFO, Noemie Heuland. [Operator Instructions]
 Now before I hand the call over to David, I want to remind everyone that our commentary may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause Ceridian's results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as the cautionary statements in our filings.
 Additionally, over the course of this call, we will reference non-GAAP measures to describe our performance. Please review our earnings press release and filings with the SEC for our rationale behind the use of non-GAAP measures and for a full reconciliation of these GAAP to non-GAAP metrics. These documents, in addition to a replay of this call will be available on the Ceridian Investor Relations website.
 And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to David. 
David Ossip: Thank you, Matt, and thank you all for joining us today on our second quarter earnings call. Today, I'll discuss our strong second quarter results, continued commitment to innovation in the HCM space and provide an update on our raised full year outlook. Leagh will provide more information on sales wins, successful customer implementations and continued scale across our organization and Noemie will add detail to our quarterly performance and updated full year outlook.
 Before I dig into our financials, I'd like to congratulate the team. Our global workforce, our customer base and our partner network. There is momentum across the organization and our HCM ecosystem. And these results are evidence of that.
 Now turning to our financial results. I'm pleased to report that we exceeded guidance across all revenue and profitability metrics in the second quarter. And we are pushing the full beat across all revenue and profitability metrics into our full year guidance raise. On a constant currency basis, Dayforce recurring revenue grew 39%. And Dayforce recurring revenue ex float grew 28% year-over-year at constant currency.
 Turning to the bottom-line metrics and cash flow. Adjusted cloud recurring gross margins of 78.1% continued to expand by 177 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $98.4 million or 27% of revenue and expanded meaningfully year-over-year by 640 basis points. This is a result of the revenue upside in the quarter and our continued focus on operational efficiencies. Adjusted operating income was $83 million or 23% of revenue and also benefited from these same trends. And we had record operating cash flows of $82 million in the quarter. Cash flow has been an area of focus for the organization. And so I'm happy to announce continued progress along this metric.
 As I mentioned, based on our first half performance, we are raising both our growth and profitability outlook for 2023. As the results show, we have and are well positioned to execute in the current macro environment and are confident that our focus on durable and profitable growth will lead to continued success and value creation. Our results are also the outcome of our commitment and our ability to continually innovate and deliver real quantifiable value to our customers. This has allowed us to win new customers while at the same time, increase product density across both new and existing customers.
 As Leagh will speak to, year-to-date, we've attached the full suite to 50% of new sales. This is validation of both our sales and product strategy. We're seeing healthy adoption of our talent solution and the new Dayforce Hub experience continues to resonate with customers.
 Dayforce Wallet continues to see healthy adoption across our new and existing customer base. We are attaching the solution to 80% of new sales, and we now have 1,640 customers sold and over 1,000 customers live on the wallet. And we expect to cross $2 billion of loans within a few weeks.
 And last quarter, Joe spoke to our AI road map. I'm pleased to announce continued progress on that front. We are advancing our usage of generative AI internally as well within our products. In our customer support organization, our generative AI support tool is now answering over 85% of directed questions, which is up over 10% from last quarter. This is on pace to provide a 10% gain in overall productivity in the customer support organization. All of this is a byproduct of training the model against implementation guides, knowledge bases and other internal documentation that is refined against customer questions and responses.
 Across the Dayforce platform, we see countless opportunities to add generative AI to up-level our analytics and augment our already intelligent solutions for customers. Joe and his team are thoughtful in their approach here and are excited to showcase what's next at our INSIGHTS conference later this year.
 And finally, I'd like to discuss global and enterprise. The Dayforce platform was built to address the global market from day 1. And part of our competitive advantage is offering native core HR, talent, workforce management and payroll solutions to almost every major geography. On this front, we are well ahead of our competitors.
 In the quarter, we developed an extendable formula-based global payroll engine that allows for rapid adoption of new native Dayforce global payroll for most countries across the Middle East and Africa.  And we continue to progress with our customers on our major payroll expansion into Germany. Our charter customers are now running payroll in country and we are progressing with the German ITSG certification Board. We expect German payroll to be generally available in Q1 of next year.
 And on the enterprise front. We brought live 279 net Dayforce customers in the first half of this year. Within that cohort of customers, our go-lives within the segment of customers of over 6,000 employees more than doubled year-over-year. And at the same time, year-to-date, average deal size has increased by 17%.  Another incremental data point validating our ability to sell a broader solution set, expand globally and to shift upmarket. 
 In summary, Ceridian remains positioned as an innovator and share taker in the global HCM market. And before I turn the call over to Leagh, I'd like to welcome customers, prospects and partners to our flagship INSIGHTS conference taking place, October 2 to 5 in Las Vegas. We are looking forward to another record-breaking year.
 One last item to discuss, I'd like to share that Noemie has decided to pursue outside opportunities. Noemie will be with us up until the end of the year and will help us onboard her successor. I'd just like to say thank you to her for the last 3 years.
 With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Leagh. 
Leagh Turner: Thank you, David. Echoing your comments, I'd like to underscore the strong momentum we are seeing throughout the entire business and the reason we're leaning into innovation across the Dayforce platform. Propelling both growth and innovation is this once-in-a-generation moment, driven by 3 intersecting opportunities that we are uniquely primed to take advantage of and which customers are reaching to us to help them through.
 The first is a complex macro environment. We help customers identify opportunities for productivity and efficiency, which they can then use to create real return and real value. Second, every organization in the world is navigating the mandate for a more connected workforce. Given the new social contract between employee and employer in this boundless world of work and Dayforce is a single global full suite people platform, which supports both the employee and the employer in this new world of work. Third, in this era of AI, jobs will be transformed, and work will get done differently. This is a historic moment, it really is, and we are being trusted to help our customers drive workforce transformation, not renovation in the era of AI.
 And if we continue to ride the wave of these 3 intersecting trends, which we have to date, we can be the people platform of this generation. Because the absolute toughest issue that companies face today is that the work is agile and flexible and efficiencies drive growth. And the other HR technologies are not known for their scale and flexibility.
 Moving to the quarter. As of Q2, we have nearly 6,300 customers on the Dayforce platform with more and more customers adopting our full suite. In fact, globally, 50% of new sales are full suite in 2023. That brings our full suite total customer base to 40%. We are a full suite company. Building on this motion, our add-on sales back to the base continued to trend ahead of expectations and represent approximately 30% of total sales year-to-date. As David touched on earlier, this validates our ability to land and expand and to deliver maximum value to our customers.
 Driving this momentum has been the realignment of our revenue and customer experience organizations under Steve Holdridge which we announced in Q1, and we continue to see both results and efficiencies from that decision. In this quarter, we announced the appointment of Sam Alkharrat as Chief Revenue Officer reporting to Steve. While we were not planning to hire for this role so quickly, Sam was a talent that we could not pass up, given his 30 years of experience as a global enterprise SaaS leader. He is a true operator who understands scale and durable growth, especially through the build-out of incremental revenue streams and sustainable ecosystems.
 His joining is yet another indicator of our ability to attract truly differentiated talent globally, and it's a testament to the fact that we are doing something very, very special here. Given the impact he's had already, we are so bullish about his future in this company and the benefit will be felt by our people and our customers.
 Now let me get into a few notable wins and go-lives. In Q2, new customer wins included a European aviation services company with 55,000 global employees, which selected Dayforce to support its people operations in 35 countries. A leading professional services company with 33,000 employees in 9 countries chose Ceridian as its trusted partner for global managed payroll. A U.S. consumer goods manufacturer with 35,000 employees globally added Europe, the Middle East and Africa to its partnership with Ceridian after choosing Ceridian for its Latin America and Asia Pacific operations in Q4 of 2022. And a leading global jewelry company with 30,500 employees selected Dayforce to provide a single workforce management solution across 39 countries.
 Also notable, organizations that we took live over the last quarter include: A multinational DAX 30 chemical and consumer goods company with 60,000 employees globally is continuing its very successful implementation with Ceridian, expanding its Dayforce deployment to 20 countries and approximately 27,000 employees to date. A leading global pet care conglomerate with 30,000 employees, launched Dayforce to its U.S. and Canadian workforces to help standardize operations and reduce turnover. And a luxury automotive manufacturer, piloted Dayforce HR and Workforce Management to a large group of their employees in Germany with plans to expand to its full German workforce of 10,000 as we move out of charter in early 2024.
 Also fueling the value our customers get from implementing Dayforce is the progress we are seeing in the partner ecosystem. It's really been phenomenal. In Q2, we announced the evolution of the Ceridian partner network to better align with our customers' journey by matching partners with customers at critical moments to drive continuous value. Within CPN, we saw Deloitte Australia, PwC U.K. and RSM accelerate the growth of their Dayforce offerings. And we also joined the Ernst & Young Global Alliance Partner program, bringing the transformational benefits of Dayforce together with EY's extensive array of services and industry insight.
 Now turning to product. Q2 saw meaningful advances across 4 critical innovation areas for our customers. Experiences, openness, compliance and intelligence. On the experience front, we made our differentiated experience hub available globally and enhanced our people search capabilities. On compliance, we continue to earn our placement as the absolute market leader with customer-driven features such as flex time pay and shift bidding. 
 On openness, we're accelerating customers' ability to leverage our ecosystem and create more connected systems with innovations like Dayforce Integration Studio, which now has interoperability across our entire partner network. And last, but far from least, we continue to deliver on empowering our customers with better intelligence, powered by AI with the launch of predictive tools like Dayforce Career Explorer and the burnout dashboard available in Dayforce people analytics. 
 On the topic of AI and as David noted, we're quite pleased with the progress we're making to integrate AI across our business because getting this right really matters, and we are seizing the opportunity to make radical breakthroughs in delivering trustworthy innovation with great care. Of course, this includes our product road map with the use of tooling in areas like talent management and career pathing, as Joe spoke to last quarter. But also ensuring that our entire company is finding ways to lean into AI to drive efficiency and value.
 We fully believe that AI innovation begins with our people. We have set up a labs function focused solely on the iterative work required to drive workplace use cases enabled by AI in addition to creating plans to roll out AI training internally ensuring that all of our employees, no matter their function are AI literate. It is this continued investment in our people that we believe is a foundation for our market differentiation as underscored by accolades in Q2, including being named one of Newsweek's top 100 Most Loved Workplaces.
 Our employees' passion for our customer success is also super inspiring as is their focus on furthering our commitment to ESG and to the communities in which we work. In Q2, we held our first ever global volunteer month, which are people rallied behind as only Ceridian people can, and we were honored to be awarded as 1 of USA Today's America's Climate Leaders in 2023. We also have earned an AA ESG rating and placement in the leader category from MSCI for the second year in a row.
 In closing, this quarter showcases that we continue to fire on all cylinders. We lean into every single part of the business to ensure that we are progressing and primed to be the go-to partner for HR organizations in this absolutely critical moment of opportunity.
 In one of the many, many conversations I had with customers this quarter, one of them said it best by noting. You are the closest thing to the Holy Grail of modern HR technology that has ever existed. You are set up for generational growth. You are everything that we thought you were. I think there is no better moment than INSIGHTS this October to connect and to communicate and to celebrate with the Dayforce community on all the goodness that we have in store for their people and organizations. It truly is a brand-new day for us.
 Now before I hand it over to Noemie to close this out, I'd also like to offer my very deep gratitude for her leadership and counsel these past years. She has been a wonderful colleague and an even more dear friend. And she's helped us drive Ceridian through a tremendous stage of growth, and she will leave us more than ready for our next stage. Thank you, Noemie. I wish you absolutely all the best, and I'm going to turn it over to you to bring us home. 
Noemie Heuland: Leagh, thank you. Our second quarter results are another proof point of the strengths of our business. I'm happy to report that all Q2 metrics exceeded guidance, giving us confidence to raise our outlook for the remainder of the year. Dayforce recurring revenue grew 39% at constant currency, underpinned by Dayforce recurring revenue ex float growth of 28% at constant currency. Growth here reflects stronger lives of larger customers and sustained employment volumes.
 Adjusted cloud recurring gross margins up 78.1%, expanded 177 basis points year-over-year, reflecting continued scale in the Dayforce business. The combination of healthy revenue growth and expanding cloud gross margins helped drive adjusted EBITDA of $98.4 million or 27% of revenue. Operating cash flows of $82 million is a record quarterly number for the company. This reflects continued discipline regarding expense management and working capital needs. As previously communicated, we continue to expect at least 50% adjusted EBITDA conversion into operating cash flows in fiscal year 2023.
 Looking ahead towards Q3 and the remainder of the year, our Dayforce revenue guidance reflects sustained employment volumes in addition to a strong quarter of go-lives. Notably, we continue to expect and remain on track to bring some of our largest customers live in Q4.
 In the third quarter, we expect Dayforce recurring revenue ex float to grow in the range of 26% to 27% at constant currency. And for fiscal year '23, on the back of a strong first half of the year, we are raising our outlook for Dayforce recurring revenue ex float and now expect growth in the range of 27% to 28% at constant currency. Our float revenue guidance of $38 million for Q3 and $160 million for the year reflects typical seasonality in the second half balances and relatively stable rates.
 With respect to total revenue, we expect between 17% and 18% growth at constant currency in Q3 and 21% to 22% for the full year. The full year raised outlook accounts for Q2 strong performance of Dayforce, Powerpay and float, while we manage the shift of our professional services revenue, especially implementation to our system integrators and partners.
 Turning to profitability. We expect Q3 adjusted EBITDA in the range of $89 million to $91 million and now expect fiscal year '23 adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $384 million to $392 million or a $15.5 million raise at the midpoint. Profitability in the second half of the year accounts for some level of investments into the business, especially in sales and marketing, as we prepare for INSIGHTS in Q4 which is typically our largest quarter, both in terms of new sales and go-lives.
 Last, Ceridian has undergone tremendous growth and scale since I joined in 2020. And our results continue to demonstrate the resilience of our business and steady progress towards our midterm financial goals. So after 3 amazing years working with the leadership team, I have decided to pursue other opportunities, but will ensure an orderly CFO transition in the upcoming weeks and months. It's been an honor to work with our colleagues around the world who are so deeply committed to our brand promise to make work life better. I'm very confident in the path ahead for Ceridian and our incredible community of customers.
 With that, Matt, I'll turn the call over to you. 
Matthew Wells: So we'll take our first question from Kevin McVeigh of Credit Suisse. 
Kevin McVeigh: Great. And Noemie, congratulations, and thanks for your contribution at Ceridian. I wonder if we could go back to the guidance, just a really, really nice outcome, boosting the revenue and really the outsized EBITDA. Is that EBITDA -- does it reflect, David, I think you mentioned a 10% increase in productivity as a result of AI. Or is that something that would be incremental as we think about it in the back half of the year? And again, very, very strong results. Does it factor in any macro change at the margin? Or just any thoughts around that, again, a really, really nice outcome. 
David Ossip: Kevin, thank you for that. Let me just unpack that question. First, we have flowed through the full beat into both our Dayforce recurring ex float and to the EBITDA. And to give clarity on that, we are raising the Dayforce recurring revenue ex float by $10 million, which is the combination of both the Q2 beat and the Q1 beat. So not only have we flowed the Q2 beat through, we've flowed the full half 1 beat throughout the year. 
 In terms of adjusted EBITDA, we are raising by $15.5 million at the mid, which is a combination of the Q2 adjusted beat of about $8 million and as well, we have increased our float expectations for the second half of the year by $6 million. And when you add the 2 together, we are raising by more than in combination. And so just we have clarity. In terms of where we are getting increased productivity, as you know, we have been very focused on the efficiencies of the actual business. As I mentioned, and Leagh mentioned, leveraging AI and generative AI is part of our strategy and would be included in some of the efficiencies that we would expect for the remainder of the year. 
Matthew Wells: And our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. 
Mark Marcon: Noemie, it's been a pleasure working with you. Congratulations and best wishes for the next stages in your career.
 With regards to the guide for recurring Dayforce revenue ex float, it looks like there's going to be some acceleration in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter and at the midpoint of the guide. Is that just because of the really high level of confidence that you have with regards to some of the bigger wins that you announced a few quarters ago that are just ready to go live and anything else that might be contributing to that? And how do you factor in the macro environment as it relates to those elements? 
David Ossip: On -- the macro side remains positive, and we remain optimistic. Regarding Q3 to Q4, there's typically some seasonality between the 2 quarters, and that would be indicative of that. 
Mark Marcon: Great. And then David and Leagh, you guys are obviously investing globally across the board, and yet the margins are expanding nicely. Can you talk a little bit about what that -- how that reflects on the scalability and the profitability of the business with existing clients? Because I would imagine that, that really suggest that what you're doing with your current clients that have been in place for a while, the profitability is really increasing substantially. 
David Ossip: Thanks, Mark. If I look at the gross margin on Dayforce recurring, which is 78.1%. It's up 174 basis points year-over-year. In terms of global, as you know, Dayforce was designed from day 1 to be global. I would say we have about a 10-year lead on any competitor from a global perspective. And I think the results reflect that we are operating at scale globally with a full global operational model. I think Leagh could add a bit more detail to that as well. 
Leagh Turner: Yes. The only thing I would add, just anecdotally, is that -- when we look at Q2, the results across the portfolio were very, very even, in it every region performed exceptionally well. And you would also have noted, Mark, from our sales win commentary, both in the prepared remarks and in the press release that we're now selling very large transactions in every region in which we operate, both full suite and land and expand. And so we will continue to do that. It's the reason that our add-on sales back to the base continue to be in the 30% range. And things are working really well as it relates to our entire global footprint. 
Matthew Wells: And our next question comes from Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho. 
Sitikantha Panigrahi: And Noemie, my best wishes as well. We are going to miss working with you.
 So my question is about large deals momentum. It's good to see now that 30,000-plus kind of deals back in Q2 versus Q1. So wondering how does the pipeline look like right now for the large deals at this point? And I saw that you've been expanded Dayforce platform to now Middle East and African countries. So can you help us understand the momentum in the pipeline in large deals. And I have a follow-up. 
David Ossip: So great questions. The best metric, I think we have in terms of momentum upmarket. If we look at the number of deals that went live in the segment above 6,000 employees, it is up 125% year-over-year. So we're seeing significant momentum upmarket and many of those are global accounts. In terms of global payroll, we have developed an extendable payroll engine that is deployable across most of Africa and across the Middle East. We already do have Dayforce customers in countries like Kenya and Mauritius and South Africa. 
Sitikantha Panigrahi: Okay. That's great. And then David, those large deals you signed last year, how is the go-live tracking so far? 
David Ossip: It's tracking very well. You see that again, if we look at the metric that I just spoke about, the number of deals -- the number of customers that went live in the 6,000 and above segment, which is the largest segment that we actually track and disclose is up 125% year-over-year. And I would say sales performance in the quarter in large enterprise and enterprise were both strong.
 Leagh, anything you would add about momentum in large enterprise or enterprise? 
Leagh Turner: I mean I just echo the 17%. Year-to-date deal size is up 17%, which is exceptional. And perhaps I'll say rolling 4 quarter pipeline is very strong. We're set up for a very strong back half and we're really pleased that Sam has decided to join us. He's an excellent addition. He's an exceptional technician and he's done a really good job of getting his feet in, really understanding the business. We'll make a few tiny tweaks to the go-to-market in order to get things to work even better but I would expect that we can continue to accelerate with his addition. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question comes from Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo. 
Michael Turrin: Great. Appreciate you taking the question. I just given the commentary on the macro continue to point to resilience, and it's maybe not the norm. I'd just love to hear if you can compare and contrast any differences you're seeing across regions or market segments. Is the resilience you're seeing, you think at all a factor of your move upmarket and some of the larger customers that you're addressing?
 And just -- I know you've gotten a few questions on it, but any details you can share around the visibility into those Q4 deals and some of the work you've put in place to enable that to remain on track given we're now -- August. And it sounds like a pretty healthy build between now and end of year. 
David Ossip: Michael, as Leagh pointed out, we believe that we'll have a strong second half on top of a strong first half. We saw employment levels come in above our expectations in the quarter and in the first quarter of the year. I believe what we've been saying about the macro is positive and optimistic and has been consistent over the last number of quarters. 
Michael Turrin: Just -- I mean, maybe a little bit more from Leagh on the go-to-market side. The appointment of Sam sounded like something you couldn't pass up. You've got some partner relationships that are referenced that are broadening out. Can you just speak to the signals that you're seeing some of the go-to-market investments you're prioritizing and just put some more context around the moves you're making. 
Leagh Turner: Yes, for sure. I mean, a little bit of digging would tell you that some of us have some past experience with Sam. And he's just -- as you said and I said, he's an exceptional addition and we just couldn't pass him up. As you know, not only does he have great, let's call it, sales and go-to-market and customer experience, but he's also excellent at analyzing and assessing how to grow a sales ecosystem.
 And we cited in the first quarter that we had a 76% increase in the number of consultants that had been trained on Dayforce and that were now in the ecosystem. And you can see that really starting to pay some serious dividends. The ecosystem continues to mature. We are ahead on -- have them sold with SIs, kickoffs with SIs, go-lives with SIs and since Sam has joined, he has some smart ideas about how we might accelerate that even further, not only with SIs, but with influence partners, third-party revenue partners, and additional relationships that we could use to generate incremental revenue streams.
 And if I could just say to your original question that David responded to, the macro, as we said last quarter, continues to be exceptionally favorable to us. Customers during tricky macro look for efficiency. They have no other way to drive growth, and we deliver efficiency. Secondly, everybody is still trying to figure out this debate through the future of work, do people -- how do people work? How do they collaborate? How do they stay aligned? And HR technology serves all of that.
 And then lastly, as it relates to AI, everybody is wrestling through this. What will work be? How will work be displaced and made different? And the reality is we're able to counsel our customers through that change, and we will even more so as the trend continues to emerge. So we see really good tailwinds for a very long protracted period of time. 
Matthew Wells: And our next question comes from Dan Jester of BMO. 
Daniel Jester: Great. David, can you just remind me about how you're thinking about the conversion of some of your past acquisitions to Dayforce and how we should be thinking about that trajectory going into next year? 
David Ossip: Yes. It's -- if I look at the APJ side of the actual business was -- inside the quarter, we had about $21.8 million of revenue. We now have effectively classified the accounts into green, yellow and red in terms of ease of movement towards Dayforce. Alongside that as well, as you know, we look at upselling them onto the talent and the workforce management component as part of that particular journey. We're beginning to start the migrations or position of the migrations right now and will continue for a number of years.
 Leagh, anything that you would add? 
Leagh Turner: No, I think you covered it. 
Daniel Jester: Great. And then with regards to implementation and sort of the push to more partners there, it was great to see that you had a partnership with an integrator to take a customer live. Maybe just an update as to kind of how you think that, that is going to progress again over the next year. At what stage do you think partners do a big -- greater chunk of the implementations, especially as you move increasingly upmarket. 
Leagh Turner: I'll grab that by saying -- first of all, great question. Thank you for it. As I said, our partner ecosystem, which started at like a standing start 3 years ago has now progressed very significantly. I would say when we look at our sales wins, I don't know, 2/3 of them have been influenced by a partner in some regard and that spans virtually every single segment in which we operate.
 And what you will continue to see is that the pipeline will increase as a result of that network effect. We imagine that more and more customers over time will be kicked off and brought live with partners. And as that happens, our partners build value-added services around Dayforce, which become very rich practices that they can continue to build their business upon over time, which is excellent for us and becomes in effect, irreversible. So I would say we're still in relatively early innings. It's working really well, better than perhaps we could have ever expected, probably as a result of the fact that our technology is so strong and the demand is so high. But as we continue to grow, I would imagine you'll only see that increase.
 And one thing I would note is that we're now seeing what we would call like mega deals happening with partners in the large enterprise space, brought to us directly by them, happening much more consistently and being brought live with real ease and proficiency. 
David Ossip: One thing I would add to that is if you actually look at the number of projects that were kicked off by SIs in the quarter, it grows to 35% on a global basis, which is up obviously significantly year-over-year. You'll also see that reflected if you do the breakdown of our total revenue line, you'll see that we're shifting the professional services now more towards the actual SIs. And as you go forward, you would expect less and less of our revenue -- total revenues, fee from professional services as our hope would be that we focus on becoming a scalable software company, leveraging our SI partners to do the majority of the implementation. 
Matthew Wells: And our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. 
Raimo Lenschow: If you look -- the highlight for me this quarter were like the wins with customers with kind of thousands of employees, which is kind of really a confirmation for the direction you are going there. What are you seeing in terms of the early-stage pipeline or the willingness of people to engage with you now like reference customer wise, you should have like a lot more. What do you see in terms of like considering the cycle and everyone is worried about what's going on in the economy versus kind of the success you're having there? Like what's the nature of the conversation there? 
David Ossip: Raimo, thank you. But we're very focused effectively on delivering quantifiable value to the customers. And in today's environment, that does come into focus, many of the organizations that look to us are looking for HR digital transformation, IT simplification, a movement towards those shared services and globalization, effectively improving decision-making through the use of AI, generative AI and just general, very powerful analytics. And obviously, we're looking at the overall experience as we move to a more simpler system that runs obviously at scale and runs globally. And that, as Leagh pointed out, has led to a very robust pipeline, I think, very good execution within the first half of the actual year.
 Leagh, what would you add to that? 
Leagh Turner: The only thing I guess I would add is just -- thank you, Raimo, for pointing that out. You would know a couple of years ago, we said that we were going to meaningfully push up into the enterprise and large enterprise space. And as you noted, every single customer that we listed either in prepared remarks or in the press release, are many, many thousands of employees. It's a real testament to us setting our mind to do something, saying we would do it and delivering. 
Raimo Lenschow: Yes. And then, Leagh, one for you, like, obviously, having tiny tweaks with like Sam joining, like tweaks is always something that makes kind of people a little bit nervous as it happens like more in the middle of the year. Can you think -- is this like kind of a little bit more moving more enterprise, getting more strategic? Or how should we think about that? 
Leagh Turner: Thank you. I mean I would say the following. I think that you prepare a thorough go-to-market and you launch it at the beginning of every year, together with sales SPAGs and quotas and any changes you might make to segmentation or territories. And it is very normal in the enterprise SaaS space to make minor modifications at the midyear point, which is all we're considering doing. 
 I'll give you an example. We're seeing real movement in our full suite sales and lots of interest in our talent products. Maybe we can add some overlay resources in order to continue to lean into that thrust, so that we can move faster to being a full suite company, and we can ensure that those customers in our current customer base who haven't yet taken advantage of that technology do. So that would be an example of a change we might consider making. No sharp turns, no major moves, just a few tweaks perhaps to drive greater increment in the back half of the year and to set us up for a great 2024. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question comes from Steve Enders of Citi. 
Steven Enders: Okay. Great. I didn't want to ask on the comment about deal sizes being up 17% versus last year. I mean, good growth there. I guess how should we be thinking about the components of that growth? Is it primarily being driven by these larger seats and moving more upmarket? Or how much is the expanded suite and more modules helping support that growth there? 
David Ossip: It's very balanced. If I look at the average number of modules across the customer base, it's up about 4x relative to 2021. So we're obviously seeing more products being used, higher module density across our client base. But as well, if we look at the number of go-lives in the upper market segment it's up 125% per year. And for us, it's very much about having a durable growth strategy that runs for a very long period of time. 
Steven Enders: Okay. Got you. That's helpful. And then on the guide, I think last quarter, you talked about seeing upside from employee levels and that not necessarily being rolled forward, I guess, was there any change in how you're thinking about those components to the current outlook and kind of what you saw this quarter on that front? 
Noemie Heuland: Yes. So in substance, what we've done is we've removed the hedge that we had in Q1, you may recall we talked about the approach around employment levels, and now we feel very confident with what we've seen in Q1 and the second quarter. So we flew the entire beat of the first half through the second half. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question comes from Matthew Pfau of William Blair. 
Matthew Pfau: Great. One question for me on the global payroll efforts. David, you mentioned that you're well ahead of competitors here. And I think clearly, some of your competitors have shown more interest in the space recently. Maybe you can discuss some of the challenges that you believe your competitors will face when trying to replicate what you have built? And how do you think your offer differs from what some of your competitors are doing? 
David Ossip: That's a very good question. There's a lot of complexity in terms of going global. It starts with the global HR model that you need to have in place. I don't believe it is possible to take a U.S. product and retrofit it to be global. There are certain data elements that have to be tracked and not tracked on a global basis. There are elements when it comes to the actual cloud environment that you're deploying and where the data actually resides.
 There are processes that have to be in place as well as to who is allowed to actually touch the data outside of country and how you operate on a global basis from that particular perspective. From a workforce management perspective, the way that time and attendance calculations work, whether it be over time, whether it be scheduling, whether it be premiums, whether it be penalty pay are not based on North American or U.S. paradigms.
 Off continent, if you go to Europe and you get into areas of like working councils, working directives that have no meaning here. If you go into geos like New Zealand, quite different from even what you would find in Australia when it comes to the way that they actually process the holidays. If you get into certain countries like Australia, you're going into kind of a construct called like multi awards where the pay policy follows the actual job classification rather than the actual employee. On the payroll side, very, very different in terms of how taxes are worked, how you actually -- to calculate pension in many cases.
 From a benefit perspective, the U.S. benefit paradigm doesn't carry outside of the U.S. It doesn't even carry into Canada. In certain countries, for example, Canada, there are national language acts where you actually have to operate equally in ways of their national languages, and that has to extend throughout your system documentation, training, website materials and the likes.
 In terms of record of employment and reporting out HR events to the various types of governments across the world, countries are very specific as to what record of employment information they want from the employees and when they want, in what actual format. When you get into the actual money movement system, very different from the U.S. going to Canada, going to the U.K., going to the EU, going to Australia, APJ, very, very, very different.
 We have built the company to be global from the onset. We started with global customers. In fact, our largest live customers are global. So I think we understand it very well. The work that Joe has been doing inside the actual platform to lift it up, very important in terms of language localization as well. I believe we are now deploying in about 165 countries and that takes a bit of work. And again, organizationally, we pivoted from being a U.S. company operating globally to a true global operating model several years ago with over half of our employees being off continent and we run the organization as a global enterprise.
 So again, I think we've got quite a long way to go. I would not want to be a new entrant into the global market starting today and competing against the likes of us. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question comes from Alex Zukin of Wolfe. 
Unknown Analyst: This is Patrick on for Alex. So during the quarter, with our checks, we've heard the Phoenix payroll system project in Canada starting to ramp. Wondering if you could give us an update on the project, what inning are we in for that initial $16.7 million pilot. And then are we still a few years out from decisions being made on the broader project there? 
Leagh Turner: Thank you for the question, Patrick. I think there's 3 things I can tell you about the work that we've been doing with the Canadian government, which we call next gen, which they call next-gen. The first thing I would tell you is that the testing results have continued to be exceptional. And we have concluded the testing.
 The second thing I would tell you is that the government is now preparing something that they call an initial findings report, which will summarize those testing results and they will present that to cabinet for consideration in the next few months.
 The third thing that I can tell you, which we view as a positive sign of momentum is that Alex Benay, who was originally with the government left to go to industry and has since come back, has been named Deputy Minister responsible for pay and that includes understanding the current Phoenix system and its limitations and thoroughly understanding the results that have emerged from next gen and helping to support the path forward. So great progress. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question comes from Robert Simmons from D.A. Davidson. 
Robert Simmons: So we've seen some consolidation in the partner ecosystem with larger partners buying some kind of regionals. Can you talk about what you're seeing there, would we -- more of that to happen and kind of the puts and takes of that dynamic? 
David Ossip: Yes. So it's very encouraging. As you know, you saw PwC purchase People Force in the U.K. People Force was a Dayforce consulting organization. And I would expect that PwC purchased People Force to handle the demand that they're seeing for our product. Likewise, in Australia, you saw -- I think it was the Deloitte purchase Enforce Consulting also Enforce is specifically Dayforce implementations in APJ and again, I would take it as a sign of very strong demand and the big SIs building out their practices. 
Robert Simmons: Got it. That makes sense. And then can you update us on the Ideal Talent Marketplace? Are you still on track to launch that this year? And then any kind of learnings you've learned so far from work you've done on it to date? 
David Ossip: We remain on track. We will be showing more of it at INSIGHTS. We would expect to go live with the first charter customers this year. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question comes from Bhavin Shah from Deutsche Bank. 
Unknown Analyst: It's Nick on for Bhavin this evening. And Noemie congratulations and best wishes on your future endeavors.
 Just looking at the back-to-the-base sales turning ahead of expectations. Can you dive a bit in on what modules have been helping to drive such strength? And how should we think about the sustainability of that growth going forward? 
David Ossip: I think part of it is what Leagh actually spoke about, was the change in go-to-market and segmentation of the actual sales force, having a dedicated overlay team going back to the base. We're quite meticulous about this. We map out the white space across all of our actual customers. We determine the right time that we can actually approach them. As we look towards a long-term and durable growth strategy, we do believe that sales back to the base has to be a big part of our success as it has been with other scaled software companies. Leagh, anything you would add? 
Leagh Turner: I guess the only thing I would add is that our retention rates continue to hold, which means that our customers are very happy with the level of service that they receive from us and the value that they receive. And as a result, happy customers buy more software. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question comes from Jackson Ader from MoffettNathanson. 
Jackson Ader: Great. I was just curious, when you look at some of these large deals heading through the pipeline or I should say, large go-lives coming at the end of the year. Can you give us a sense of what markers you either can or can't already see that say, yes, we feel really good about these or we might be able to tell in a few months' time, this isn't really a good sign. What are some of the things that you tend to look for as you head into those go-lives that mean that they are indeed going to hit in the fourth quarter. 
David Ossip: This is not a business run on luck and chance. We have a weekly meeting, a service forecast call where we go through every account that is currently under implementation. For each account, we assign a risk of them actually pushing, any account that has a risk of pushing of more than 30%, we go into actual detail. When we actually look at the actual forecast, which we do on a quarter-over-quarter basis, we have a forecasted amount that we hold the sales group account -- sorry, the services group accountable for and has run very well. I mean we have Steve here as well. Steve anything that you would add from a color perspective? 
Stephen Holdridge: All I would add is we actually have very good visibility. We have a very good understanding of what we expect to happen, and we have the ability, and we've shown the ability to accurately predict that. So in terms of our view for the second half of the year. I think it's based on a pretty solid foundation and experience, so we feel confident in it. 
Jackson Ader: Okay. All right. Great. And then, Leagh, on the full suite penetration, so if half of the kind of new wins in this year are full suite customer base, like 40% or so. What kind of timeline do you try and build toward after maybe an initial deal that doesn't go full suite that you end up kind of building toward a road map to getting them to full suite customers. 
Leagh Turner: Thank you. Great question. What I would say is done right, and we try and do this more and more consistently. We position a full suite right upfront. So we assess the full end-to-end white space in our customer, and therefore, the maximum value that we could contribute and if a customer decides to begin with a SKU or 2, they do it knowing what the total available white space and total available value is, which means that we have an opportunity to go back almost right away to begin talking about expanding the value, particularly so as we take those modules live, we prove that we're doing it on time and on value. You can imagine that customers are quite receptive to expanding their relationship. 
Matthew Wells: That concludes our conference call for the night. Thank you, everybody, for joining us. We'll catch up with you over the quarter.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-05-03 17:00:00) =====
Matthew Wells: [Audio Gap]  
 David Ossip and Leagh Turner; our CFO, Noemie Heuland; and our CTO, Joe Korngiebel. [Operator Instructions] 
 And before I hand the call over to David, I want to remind everyone that our commentary may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause Ceridian's results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission such as the cautionary statements in our filings. 
 Additionally, over the course of this call, we will reference non-GAAP measures to describe our performance. Please review our earnings press release and filings with the SEC for our rationale behind the use of non-GAAP measures and for a full reconciliation of these GAAP to non-GAAP metrics. These documents, in addition to a replay of this call, will be available on the Ceridian Investor Relations website. 
 And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to David. 
David Ossip: Thank you, Matt, and thank you all for joining us today for our first quarter earnings call. Today, I'll discuss our strong first quarter results and talk to our continued technology leadership in HCM. Leagh will give more information on recent sales wins, successful customer implementations and continued efficiencies in our organization. Joe is also in the call and will discuss our investments in innovation, including new products and Generative AI. And Noemie will then provide insights on our quarterly performance and 2023 full year guidance. I will begin with our financial results.
 We had another fantastic quarter, exceeding guidance across all revenue and profit metrics. On a constant currency basis, Dayforce recurring revenue grew 46% year-over-year. As that's a very high number, let me break it down. Dayforce recurring revenue ex float grew 29% on a constant currency basis, with tax modernization contributing approximately 600 basis points of growth. 
 Adjusted EBITDA was $105.4 million or 28.4% of revenue. This was driven by the revenue upside and a focus on operational efficiencies. Along these lines, adjusted cloud recurring gross margin was 78.7%, which expanded 320 basis points year-over-year as we continue to drive synergies across hosting and support while delivering industry-leading Net Promoter Scores. 
 Adjusted operating income of $88.5 million was also up significantly as we benefited from these trends. Looking towards the rest of the year, we are raising both our revenue and profitability targets for fiscal 2023. 
 Before I discuss the macro and why we see continued traction in an evolving market, let me say thank you to our exceptional employees, partners and customers. Obviously, Leagh and I are very proud of how we live our brand promise of make work life better every day and how this focus has led to quite simply impressive results. Thank you. 
 On the macro, the economy continues to adjust to the new ways of working, and we are finding that there are several trends that are driving selection and adoption of Dayforce. First, all organizations are very focused on efficiencies. As described on previous calls, Dayforce was built around to delivering quantifiable value to our customers. This is part of our DNA. Before we build any feature, we identify and measure that this feature will impact. The measure must be quantifiable and convertible into a dollar benefit to the client. 
 For example, with Dayforce Wallet, we have seen voluntary attrition rates decline by more than 20%, saving our clients significant employee turnover and trading costs. It is this focus that has delivered strong returns to our customers and helps position Dayforce ahead of the competitors and drives Dayforce demand even in today's macro. 
 Also, tied to efficiency is the focus on IT simplification and automation. All organizations are looking for ways to reduce the number of systems that they use as this saves duplicate hosting and licensing costs, expensive integration cost and unnecessary internal IT resources. As you know, Dayforce is a complete human capital management system that is differentiated in a single database and continuous rule engine design. This allows organizations to eliminate duplicate system costs, simplify user experiences and reporting and to leverage automation to speed up while further reducing costs. 
 Again, this drives demand and adoption of Dayforce. The third industry trend is delivering an exceptional experience for all types of employees. This applies to candidates, employees, flexible workers, alumni and pensions. Today's global market demands of employees are connected and aligned no matter their status or location. We have been laser focused on this. 
 Last year, we introduced the Dayforce Hub, which allows customers to imagine, easily deliver and manage a streamlined communication experience for all their people across both web and mobile. The adoption of the Hub has been amazing probably because employees use Dayforce every day to view their schedules, swap shifts, record time and see their pay. In other words, we always have the attention of the employee. 
 A few weeks ago, I attended the Dayforce User Group Meeting, where 3 customers proudly showcased their hubs. I was exceptionally impressed mostly because it's apparent that customers love the product. But how this differentiated from competing HR portal in that it is one with the core HR data model. This means if a person moves location, changes roles or status, the person is automatically assigned to the appropriate upgrade. And so the experience for that individual is always right and relevant. 
 And in terms of relevancy, what I mean is that the hub shows the HR metrics relevant to that person, such as what's my intra week wage percent, what's my turnover rate, what's my team engagement score. The hub also highlights any items requiring approval or attention, such as approving time off requests, providing performance feedback, selecting benefit choices or attending a specific training. And it allows the organization to publish any company or team news relevant to that person. 
 From an admin perspective, the hub is a powerful platform that leverages a single database, perform and workflow capabilities, the deep linking to both Dayforce and third-party systems. This allows customers and partners to build engaging and meaningful employee experiences. As you can tell, I'm quite excited about the hub and believe that it is too a driver of Dayforce demand and traction. 
 The fourth industry trend is growth. Many of our customers have grown either organically or through acquisition. In both cases, growth drives complexity and often, that complexity becomes a barrier to future growth. 
 Dayforce as a global people platform allows organizations to apply best practices such as standardization, job harmonization, shared services and globalization that allows companies to move quicker, to grow out adding as many HR resources and to take advantage globally of lower labor cost jurisdictions. This is exceptionally important given the current wage inflation. 
 Dayforce is differentiated by its global HR payroll and workforce management capabilities. And again, this too drives demand and adoption. Another trend that is driving product demand is compliance. Organizations globally are struggling to be compliant with wage now, data privacy, data residency requirements, cybersecurity and internal order and SOX controls. As you know, Dayforce is recognized in this regard. We are a leader in compliance, and so this too has led to increased demand and adoption. 
 The last trend is decision-making. Effective decision-making is essential for any organization and Dayforce helps organizations make better decisions by providing knowledge to the right person at the right time. Dayforce has hundreds of prebuilt reports, categorized across HR and operational categories. The reports and single database design allows data to be easily presented and visualized. This allows an organization to design, roll out and track the effectiveness of HR and operational strategies. The reports can be delivered through dashboards, messages, hub info cards or via intelligent nudges. And the nudges can be used to encourage employees to take action on operational HR costs. 
 I have seen customers highlight intra-week wage percent, overtime and attendance numbers that allow their operational managers to make same-day decisions to run their businesses more efficiently and more profitably. I have also seen customers highlight employee engagement scores, turnover rates, time and cost to hire that provide valuable insights into HR trends so that their leaders can identify areas for improvement and make the necessary changes. 
 And it should come as no surprise that we are actively exploring ways to integrate generative AI into our platform, our customer life cycle and our business. This is an area that I'm very excited about, and Leagh and Joe will take us there shortly. 
 In summary, Ceridian remains positioned as an innovator and a share taker in the global HCM market. Our Dayforce differentiation has allowed us in many ways to ride the current macro wave successfully. And before I turn the call over to Leagh, I'd like to welcome partners, customers and prospects to our upcoming summits in Chicago, Atlanta and Toronto. These events will showcase how Dayforce enables customers to transform their organization for today's world of work. 
 Now I'll turn the call over to Leagh. Leagh, the floor is all yours. 
Leagh Turner: Thank you, David. Echoing your comments, I'm pleased to report that Ceridian continues to deliver both top and bottom line results, demonstrating the durability of our business and our focus on efficiency, productivity and operational scale.
 Before turning the call over to Joe to talk about our product momentum and road map, I'd like to highlight a handful of recent sales wins and go-lives in addition to providing context on what continues to drive our success. In Q1, we saw strong growth across the entire Ceridian community. In fact, this quarter, we surpassed 6,000 customers on the Dayforce platform, with 52% of our sales this quarter representing full suite. To put this into context, over the course of the past 5 years, we've effectively doubled our customer footprint while continuing to build modules into our leading HCM platform that are increasingly appealing across every segment. 
 On top of this, we had strong go-live activity this quarter. Together with our partners, we brought live over 180 new customers, ensuring that we continue to help organizations around the world and across industry drive efficiency and transformation in this very complex environment. This momentum, in addition to a healthy back-to-the-base sales motion, which is tracking well against our full year target of 25% to 30% add-on sales, drives a very durable growth formula that underpins our results. 
 Now I'm going to get into a few notable Q1 wins and go-lives. In Q1, new customer wins include a humanitarian aid and community services not-for-profit in Australia, which chose Dayforce to support its 27,800 employees with plans to double this number over the course of the next 5 years. A U.S. provider of voice and data network communications with 11,500 employees in 30 states chose Dayforce as a single HCM platform to drive efficiency and manage workforce complexity. And the Canadian operations of one of the world's largest global automotive companies with 8,000 Canadian employees replaced its legacy platform with Dayforce Workforce Management, industry solutions and benefits to help reduce operating risk and increase data visibility. 
 Also, some notable organizations that we took live over the course of the last quarter include: a global leader in contingent workforce management, which recently launched Dayforce to improve the experience and increase the scalability across its 18,000 contingent workers in the United States; one of the world's largest payment processing corporations with over 15,000 employees in 79 countries went live with Dayforce HR, payroll and workforce management in Ireland and in Denmark. And a multi-brand retail company with approximately 11,000 employees at over 650 locations in the U.S. and Canada went live with Dayforce HR, benefits Time, Advanced Scheduling and Learning for its U.S. population. 
 Within this momentum, we continue to see Dayforce Wallet as a differentiated solution that best ties together our unique product leadership and ability to innovate. We now have more than 1,540 customers that have signed on to the wallet with over 930 lives. Registration rates have surpassed 50%, and we've seen loads triple year-over-year to $350 million in Q1, reflecting continued demand and healthy usage across the entire customer base. 
 While it remains a competitive differentiator for our sales team with over 80% attach rates to new sales wins and early traction in the U.K., where our PEPM model is being rolled out is very, very positive. And for those of you who don't know, pay cycles in the U.K. are monthly, so an on-demand solution offers real in-market differentiation. 
 Also fueling our momentum is the vibrancy of our growing partner ecosystem as we're seeing great progress across every single channel, including influence partners, private equity partners, software partners and of course, our system integrator partners. And we're seeing the impact of their work in the momentum behind our pipeline, our kickoffs and our go-lives. The energy of this community is very strong, and we're excited to make the most of it as we host our Ceridian Partner Summit this month in Chicago. 
 Related to that, I'd be remiss not to update you on the progress we're seeing from aligning our revenue and customer experience organizations together under Steve Holdridge, which we announced to you last quarter. I'm happy to report that Steve and his team are doing a great job, and we're seeing his leadership bear fruit in terms of driving alignment and efficiency across our teams and for our customers. It's clear that this is absolutely the right model for us to further activate our growth levers in this environment, and we remain focused on creating best-in-class operational effectiveness across the entire customer life cycle with proven leaders and programs that will continue to help us win. 
 As David teed up upfront, our one avenue we're leveraging to drive these efficiencies is threading AI across our business. More specifically, near term, we believe there's a strong fit for Generative AI to augment our customer support organization, allowing them to serve customer needs more efficiently and proactively. We have a proof of concept that currently involves training the model with Ceridian's product knowledge base, release notes and implementation guides, and we're optimistic that this will improve key metrics, including rep productivity, response times, customer satisfaction and overall employee empowerment and engagement. While this project is still in beta, early results have been very promising, and we believe that this is just the absolute beginning for the application of predictive and autonomous tech in our internal and customer-facing environments. 
 In closing, the macro environment is very favorable to us, and the demand for Dayforce has never been higher. Market-leading companies with strong balance sheets are focusing on the fundamentals, and they are investing, and we are taking share. This quarter gives me great confidence in our ability to continue to execute against our medium- and long-term goals. We have the right team, the right go-to-market strategy and the absolute right value proposition. And together with our partners, we are uniquely capable of helping our customers and prospective customers not just survive in this environment but thrive. In closing, like David, I'd like to thank our customers, our investors, our shareholders and most of all, our people for allowing us to seize this opportunity. 
 And with that, I'll turn it over to Joe to walk you more deeply through our product momentum and AI road map. Joe, over to you. 
Joseph Korngiebel: Thank you, Leagh. Our momentum continued to climb within our people platform in Q1 as we successfully delivered timely and impactful innovations to our customers. The most impactful and important part of our road map ahead is our continued AI and machine learning investments. 
 In Q1, our use of Generative AI within our products progressed substantially and is beginning to deliver quantifiable value for our customers and their employees with this technology. Even before a candidate starts in their career, all the way through every step along the way in their career, Generative AI technology is transforming our entire HCM suite. Let me highlight a couple of examples that we are working on with our customers.
 A talent acquisition copilot for recruiters. This assists with the authoring of job titles and job descriptions for requisitions instantly and provides a domain-specific large language model that provides them a personalized company-specific chatbot experiences for a candidate. It gets them the answers to their questions instantly that they might have about their potential employment, things like job details, benefits questions, company culture information and resources they need. They're answered instantly. This naturally extends into a career copilot for employees. This saves them time and improves their productivity by helping with things like writing personalized quarterly goals, authoring performance reviews. Yes, those time-wasting performance reviews are now a copilot assist me and provides much greater productivity with and generating personalized learning pads that are based on the data that we have around a person's career, especially their skills with our Dayforce skills engine. 
 We're also looking to leverage our strength in payroll and workforce management compliance with a pay and compliance copilot. This is for administrators to help shield our customers from operational risk. We're mining business process data so that we could automatically draft HR policies, and we can work as a copilot to help automate payroll, so we can find anomalies in the data before you even run payroll and really help to realize the vision of autonomous payroll, driving to resolution of these open anomalies and driving errors down to 0 with your payroll. 
 As always, we're embarking on this journey with our customers and keeping data stewardship at the forefront of what we're doing from security to privacy, to governance, to algorithm transparency and fair practices, keeping that in the foreground. You see our architectural approach of a single database without multiple systems are stitching together acquisitions that really fragment your data and provide it impossible to have a clean set of data for these powerful algorithms and really the source behind Generative AI. This is a unique advantage for us in the data age. 
 And as a trusted compliance leader for our customers, we are transforming the industry with this innovation. Really, we're doing it with responsible innovation together to redefine the value and impact that our HCM platform can have on making work life better for our customers and their employees. 
 I'm incredibly excited about our future ahead and really raising the bar for what our HCM can do for our customers in this time of efficiency and productivity. 
 But now let's look at the financials of our quarter with Noemie. Noemie, over to you. 
Noemie Heuland: Thank you, Joe. We entered the year with healthy top line momentum underpinned by Dayforce recurring revenue growth of 46% at constant currency, driven by Dayforce recurring revenue ex float growth of 29% at constant currency. This reflects sustained employment volumes, strong seasonal activities related to year-end and a 600 basis point benefit from tax modernization. Revenue upside dropped to the bottom line, and adjusted cloud recurring gross margins continued to expand, helping drive adjusted EBITDA of $105.4 million or 28.4% margin ahead of our initial guidance. 
 Operating cash flow of $11.3 million reflects a mix of typical Q1 cash outflows and some onetime items that we expect will normalize throughout the year. For example, there was a $13 million onetime reserve established for the National Trust Bank that impacted cash flows in the quarter. If normalized from these trends, our operating cash flows would have been in the range of $25 million still reflecting typical seasonality. 
 Looking ahead towards Q2. There are a handful of items I'd like to highlight that impact sequential growth. First, our Dayforce recurring revenue ex float for Q2 was 23% to 24% growth at constant currency, reflects sustained employment trends observed in Q1, in addition to about 400 basis points of growth driven by our tax modernization. It's worth noting that tax modernization does amount to about $3.5 million sequential headwind versus Q1 as the tax business is seasonal, which we previously highlighted. Second, float revenue of $38 million reflects a step down in average balances and an incrementally lower yield as compared to Q1. This is in line with pre-COVID trends. 
 Turning now to fiscal year '23 guidance. We are raising our top line expectations for the year and now expect Dayforce recurring revenue ex float growth in the range of 26% to 27% constant currency, reflecting sustained employment trends and go-lives weighted towards the second half of the year. And as the team previously mentioned, we continue to see healthy usage and customer trends for the Dayforce Wallet. And as such, we expect to exit 2023 with an ARR in the range of $14 million to $16 million. On the heels of improving efficiency across the organization, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook for the year by $6 million at the low end and $4 million at the high. Of note, we continue to expect conversion of full year adjusted EBITDA to operating cash flows of about 50%. 
 Before I pass the call to Matt, I'd like to echo David and Leagh in saying that as a company, we remain well positioned to deliver durable and profitable growth over the medium term. 
 With that, Matt, I'll turn the call over to you. 
Matthew Wells: Thanks, Noemie. Our first question is going to come from Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho. 
Sitikantha Panigrahi: Great. David, it's a really impressive Q1 a bit across all metrics. And even if I look at Dayforce recurring revenue ex float and ex tax migration, that's almost $7 million, $8 million bid. But my question about the Q2 guidance, just wondering, are you seeing any changes in terms of customer go-live or employment level or even our pipeline? Or is it mostly a factor of conservative guidance, which is kind of a slight change in your strategy? So any color would be helpful. 
David Ossip: Siti, the Q1 to Q2 is tied to seasonality of our business. In Q4 and Q1, we have the year-end processes that add additional recurring revenue. We called that out, by the way, at the end of last year. We mentioned that the tax modernization would be $11 million in Q1, dropping to $7.5 million in Q1 -- sorry, in Q2. And that is the delta that you see between Q1 and Q2. So it is nothing other than typical seasonality. 
 As referenced, I'd point you back to the last year of normality, which was in the first half of 2020, and you'll see the $4 million reduction between Q1 and Q2. It's a typical pattern that you can expect from us. 
Sitikantha Panigrahi: That's a fair point and good color. And just a follow-up. You talked about a lot of large deals last year. Wondering how is the go-live trend. You talked about second half mostly go live. So how is this trending so far? Is that on track? Or any color would be helpful. 
David Ossip: Yes, we were very pleased, by the way, with the go-lives in Q1, slightly ahead of what our forecast was. We're very confident in the go-live forecast for the remainder of the year. If you look at the implied acceleration rate on Dayforce recurring for the second half of the year, you'll see that the numbers are there, again, consistent with what we reported with our Q4 earnings call. 
Matthew Wells: And we'll take our next question from Mark Marcon of Baird. 
Mark Marcon: Congratulations to the team on the big increase in terms of profitability. One thing I was really impressed by was you ended up having a 53% increase in terms of gross profit on a year-over-year basis across the consolidated operations, and yet SG&A was essentially flat to down a little bit leading to this rapid increase in terms of operating profit on a GAAP basis. 
 Can you talk a little bit about the areas of leverage, particularly on the SG&A? Like what did you end up skinning down? And how should we think about those efficiency targets moving throughout the year because that was really impressive? 
David Ossip: Thanks for that, Mark. Appreciate it. As you know, we've been quite focused on the bottom line and driving efficiencies across the business. First of all, I'd point out that if you look at the most important metric, which is the cloud recurring gross margin, that was up 320 basis points year-over-year to 78.7%. One of our targets that we've communicated to the market is getting that number to above 80%. And you can see that we have obviously a direct line of sight to that. 
 As well right across SG&A, you will notice that on the G&A line itself, you see much more profitability. In Q1 of last year, we were at 11.9%, and that's now dropped down to 10.6%. You'll see the sales and marketing efficiencies as well flow directly through with about a 400 basis points improvement year-over-year as the changes that we've made in terms of sales and marketing are driving additional productivity. And then there is a little bit of seasonality towards that as well. Q1 typically, a lighter quarter for us from a marketing spend. That builds up as we get into the Summits and Insights towards the end of the year. 
Mark Marcon: That's great, really great to see. And then the other thing that was really impressive is just the number of international and multinational wins. Can you talk a little bit more about your ability to really differentiate yourself and where that market opportunity is? What inning we're in with regards to seeing these multinationals take on a modern HCM platform? And how should we think also about the time to go live for those multinational operations? How should we think about that as it flows through to revenue for the balance of this year and going into next year and the following year? 
David Ossip: I believe we're differentiated in our global approach from a core HR model. We've done a tremendous number of investments over the last probably about 4, 5 years in that. We're very, very comprehensive in terms of our global coverage in terms of core HR down to the compliance and the forms that required in the different geos that we play in. 
 As you know, on top of that, we have the payroll capability, which is quite differentiated in market. That is all in one platform across both our native and our global payroll interface pieces of capability. The Hub experience as well has become a very large differentiator, which is becoming the central means of communication and engagement, all global organizations to do comms across their entire business. 
 And what's nice about the hub is that is one with the underlying global HR model, which means as people move across geos, as they move across brands, as they change roles, as they change status, we present exactly the right experience for that person at that time. And that is leading to a lot of wins on the global side. 
 In terms of time to go live, we aren't seeing much of a difference. The only real difference is that we're not constrained to quarterly go-lives with the global deployments. We can go live typically on a monthly basis. In some geos, we time occasionally to a go live for a tax, yes. 
Leagh Turner: The only thing I would add, if I could, David, is that, Mark, if you look at our press release, 6 of 8 of the go-lives that we announced are global multinationals. You see the same reflected in our sales wins. And as David talked about, right off the jump, and we talked about this last quarter, as organizations look for efficiency and scale, they're globalizing their employee base, and we are set to capture share. And we are years ahead of anyone else in this regard with really modern tech that can help enable that shift. 
David Ossip: The one piece I probably would add is on the SI front because that is driving the success on the global. The -- our SI program and the adoption by the larger size and the local SIs in the different countries is really much more advanced than it was a year ago, and it's continuing to advance as we go forward. In fact, a few weeks ago, I was in Dallas attending one of the large global SI conferences, where they had their global partners come to Dallas to discuss ways that we can actually build out the partnership. And that's driving a lot of the lead gen that we have, and they are doing most of the deployments on a global basis. 
Matthew Wells: And our next question comes from Bhavin Shah, Deutsche Bank. 
Bhavin Shah: Just one for now. Just looking at Dayforce recurring revenue per customer, it looks like it accelerated on a year-over-year growth basis this quarter. Can you just maybe help dive into the sustainability of that kind of acceleration? And what are some of the key drivers behind this? How should we think about the continued benefit of attaching more modules versus kind of continuously seeing traction upmarket? 
David Ossip: Yes. So to put the numbers in perspective, it went from basically $196,000 per incremental customer to $225,000, which was up about 14% year-over-year. Obviously, that is part of the actual beat that you see. That tied to -- we also had a very good go-live quarter with 186 customers go live relative to 175  the year before, which was also up about 10% but that we would expect that to continue. 
Bhavin Shah: Got it. And then maybe just on the float balance side of things. I mean that only -- that kind of decelerated in growth. Any way to think about how we should be thinking about that float balance throughout the rest of the year? 
David Ossip: The float balance in Q1 does go up relative to the other quarters. In terms of the remainder of the year in terms of float, it was up about 3% in Q1 year-over-year. If I'm looking towards the remainder of the year, I would probably use that as a good guide, Matt, from that perspective, it will be slightly higher I think in Q2, but I think from a planning perspective, use the 3% [ bonus not such a being less in ] market than they were previously. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question is from Mark Murphy of JPMorgan. 
Mark Murphy: Congrats on all the success and the market share gains. I was wondering if you could first clarify that just on the disclosure about the 600 basis points tailwind from tax migrations, you've made that, I think, a couple of quarters in a row. We've always had some degree of tailwind from the bureau migrations for many, many years. Are we getting to the end of that process where we would have a minimal tailwind in a year or 2? Or is that something that you think should continue and you've just decided to be calling it out kind of more clearly on the earnings press release? 
David Ossip: So it's part of the move to the Dayforce type technology, right? So with the tax, we went from old bureau tech to move it around to the Dayforce platform. There are some other components still in what we're now calling other revenue as opposed to bureau revenue. You've got the pieces that are tied to the Ascender and the Excelity acquisitions, which I think you know there's about $85 million in the APJ kind of revenue stream for fiscal 2023 that over time as well will be moved over to the Dayforce side. In the nearer term, as well, we're looking at modernizing some of the underlying tech on the Powerpay. And so at some point in time, that also will become part of Dayforce. 
Mark Murphy: Okay. So it sounds like some of this is going to continue into the future. And then... 
David Ossip: I think you still have a couple of years left, yes. 
Mark Murphy: Yes, a couple of years left. Okay. And then, David, can you clarify -- there was a great discussion in there about all the copilots and wonderful insights on using them in many ways. Are your Generative AI copilots built on Microsoft ChatGPT as a large language model? Or did you architect that some other way or build something on your own there? 
David Ossip: So let me let Joe answer that. 
Joseph Korngiebel: I appreciate the question. We, of course, as our enterprise company, have to keep data privacy, data security, data governance, and most importantly, data ethics in the forefront of what we're doing. So we're building large language models, leveraging some of the open source capabilities that are coming out of the great work that's happening in the industry right now. A lot of what the industry is doing are really giving back some of the great technology and things that you're seeing just in the media everywhere. 
 But we don't use it right off of the shelf. We use it. We bring it into our house, and we make sure we put it within our tech stack, so we can still have that single source of truth for our customers in the right way we govern the data, make sure we're just stewards of our customers' data at the end of the day. And if we do it together and responsibly, like as you heard in the overall call, I see a transformation of our industry happening in front of us. And I think with the way we are architected, we have a distinct advantage. We don't cobble together a bunch of data sets and worry about having our customers wonder if there's data leakage and other things happening. Our architecture is incredibly sound when it comes to data governance and I'm looking forward to the continued innovation with our own large language models and our own use of this technology. 
Matthew Wells: And our next question comes from Samad Samana from Jefferies. 
Jordan Boretz: This is Jordan Boretz on for Samad. Congrats on the strong results. So David and Leagh, not to beat a dead horse, but you spoke to the really strong 1Q Dayforce go-lives. Obviously, really, really impressive. I'm trying to understand what specifically drove that significant increase year-over-year. Were there any notable changes to call out around your partners' ability to onboard clients? Were there any initiatives that you maybe started with them? Or is it more so just greater productivity on that end? 
David Ossip: So there's greater productivity on the go-live front. There also was a little bit of a tailwind from employment levels with inside the quarter of about $600,000, $700,000 that came into the actual quarter as well, but largely, it was just good execution. 
Leagh Turner: Yes. If I could just add, sales, kickoffs and go-lives by partners continued to increase quarter-over-quarter and exponentially so year-over-year. And we imagine this 3 or 4 years ago. We started to build the infrastructure to make this possible, and we expect that we will be able to continue to ride this wave in perpetuity. So you should expect that this is a trend that will persist in our business. 
Jordan Boretz: Great. That makes a lot of sense. And then a quick question for Noemie just on the guidance. So on the full year adjusted EBITDA guidance, you spoke to the increase there. And it looks like there was a really nice outperformance in 1Q, but maybe the full amount wasn't carried through to the full year. So I'm just curious, was any of that related to the accounting change you called out last quarter? And were there  any -- where are those incremental dollars being invested into the business? 
Noemie Heuland: No, it's really more like seasonality of spend. We're obviously carrying and flowing through some of the performance from the first quarter as we continue to focus on profitability and scale. But we're also continuing to invest in our product organization. You heard Joe talk about all the innovations around Generative AI as well as global expansion as well as the wallet. So those are areas of investments for us. 
 We continue to invest in sales and marketing as well in demand generation, in pipeline build and marketing campaigns, which you'll see materializing throughout the year. So those are areas that we are continuing to invest throughout the year. But we're -- again, we're flowing through a pretty large portion of the profitability beat from the first quarter through the year. 
 The other thing I want to call out as well is the cloud recurring gross margin. You saw the improvement in the first quarter, up 320 basis points year-on-year. We see the fruits of our efforts from last year in modernizing our support organization, shifting some of the work into lower-cost jurisdictions, embedding automation in the product to ease the burden on the support. So all those things that we've started a couple of years ago start to materialize now, and we continue to expect cloud recurring gross margin to grow throughout the year as well. 
Jordan Boretz: Great. It was definitely great to see it increase even ex the float. So congrats on the strong results there. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question comes from Matthew Pfau, William Blair. 
Matthew Pfau: I wanted to first follow up on the Generative AI discussion and just get your view in terms of how you're thinking about the sort of initial wave of impact in your business from the products you're developing. Is it more furthering your competitive differentiation? Or do you also envision a PEPM opportunity here with these products you're working on? 
Joseph Korngiebel: I'll take that. So I appreciate the question. And yes, we're going through a renaissance right now in all aspects of technology, but especially in the people applications that we really serve for our customers. The first and foremost is automation and efficiency. I think what we're able to do with the tech is to start to drive more efficiencies and automation in a time of need. We can take what tasks would take a long time to do. We look at what we're doing with some of the things to really recruit candidates and find candidates into a very labor intensive to go through resumes very labor intensive to have interview after interview to answer their questions. 
 You look at what chatbot technology can do and really powerful large language models. It can pre-write a lot of the content that you need, and then they can provide those answers instantly instead of a lot of back and forth. Those type of efficiencies we're seeing from our customers. They're making a meaningful value add to their business when they need to drive efficiency. Are we looking to then monetize that? Yes. 
 As we look through, I mentioned the concept of copilots. I look at the technology, and again, the business we're in is making people's work life better. We feel like fundamentally, we can do that with this technology. We can start to elevate people's work and provide them with more time for the value add that they can add to the business as opposed to more of the task be automated. And so we are looking to provide copilots for the different personas that we support, a copilot for an employee in their career, help them through it, copilot for a recruiter, a copilot for a payroll administrator who at time spends a lot of time in non-value-added work. And so yes, we feel like the copilot concept that we're doing is, over time, going to be monetized in new products that we can offer to our customers to really make work more efficient for their employees. 
David Ossip: Just a couple of points. We also have a number of initiatives with Generative AI internally. Specifically, if we look at the support group, 70% of the inbound tickets are what we classify as knowledge based. In other words, asking questions about the product, how do I do something. We have built a tool that when we are now testing it across 60 different support reps. We have found that the tool can answer 75% of the inbound questions, and we've trained it only with our knowledge bases and our implementation guide. In other words, what words have set the model not to look at the public Internet or any information, only look at the documents that we've actually provided and the ability for it to answer at a very high degree of confidence is 75% of the inbound questions can be answered by the tool. 
 There are some other smaller features inside the product that we're looking at. If you're configuring the application and you require a description, say, for a job, we can call an API that basically returns the job description based on the name of the actual job. When you work in different languages, when you create a record in the database or a particular one language, it can ask if you would like it to add the descriptions and the names and the other languages. So there's immediately some productivity features that will flow through the application. 
 And then as we get more sophisticated, you'll see it in the actual copilots. The same tool that we're using for support, we'll be seeing quite a good return in it being able to actually do some of the configuration work, writing reports, data migration types of tasks. So I do think you'll see an impact as well to the cloud recurring gross margin over time as well. 
Matthew Pfau: Great. Very helpful detail on that. And then one on the full suite uptake you're seeing and good to see the over 50% of new deals in the quarter taking the full suite. Is there any trend in terms of customer size that's adopting the full suite? 
David Ossip: It's right across the board. I'm seeing some very, very large organizations looking at the full suite. The hub experience and its attachment to the knowledge base with inside the actual system is very, very powerful because it allows you to centralize your communications tied to the HR model that is present at the moment. For the right experience, it's in front of the right person. And that cuts right across the whole HCM spectrum. So you can have a candidate experience, a retiree and alumni, an active employee and you're always publishing pertinent information to that individual. And obviously, the more modules you use within our system, the more information that you can make present from an engagement and communication perspective. 
Leagh Turner: The only other thing I would add, if I could, is just we said this last quarter, and we would underscore it again because it's showing up both on the sales side and the go-live side is that during a tough macro, platform players win. That's just all there is to it, and we're really seeing that in our pipeline. 
Matthew Wells: We'll take our next question from Jared Levine from Cowen. 
Jared Levine: In terms of the demand environment, were there any notable differences in terms of by employer size, geography or vertical here? And then in terms of the qualified pipeline, any noticeable change relative to the beginning of the year as well? 
David Ossip: Our large enterprise and enterprise pipeline continues to grow relative to last year, but that's tied largely to the changes we made from a go-to-market perspective and the build-out of the actual team. It's a healthy pipeline, I'll say, right across segment and across geo. 
Jared Levine: Okay. Perfect. And then in terms of sales force, can you discuss how the number of sales reps compared to the start of the year and how you expect sales headcount to land for the full year? 
Leagh Turner: Yes. I mean we were fully staffed out of gate, which is critical to a really good launch of the year and a good successful go to market. We're considering adding head count in areas where we're seeing real buoyancy, and we're doing that judiciously. But you should expect, frankly, that once you launch a go to market, they're only tweaking it really at the midyear point. And we think we have a great go to market that's producing excellent results. So that's about where we're at. 
Matthew Wells: And we'll take our next question from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. 
Raimo Lenschow: Can I stay on the pipeline question, please? Obviously, we are in -- the economy is impacted at the moment. Question is to what degree. What are you seeing in terms of early-stage pipeline and willingness of clients to think about big -- these projects that will usually take a while to kind of move over payroll, et cetera, like what are you seeing in early stage pipeline? Congrats from me as well. 
David Ossip: Thanks a lot. Well, first, Raimo, I would argue it's not a long implementation. We've had very successful implementations at the large enterprise side of -- in that 5- to 9-month time frame. So the move from one payroll system to Dayforce is very streamlined, very effective, and typically, it solves a lot of compliance and inefficiencies for the organization right off the actual bat. 
 As Leagh pointed out, the strength of our platform, and I would argue now that each of the modules that we have in the platform are very competitive even against the best of breeds. In other words, they're very, very deep, tied to the fact that we can really lift up the overall experience to the person through the way that it flows, information flows across the different modules gives us a strong advantage. 
 There is a significant savings to the customer when they move to Dayforce from a whole range of different types of technology. The savings comes from reduced subscription fees. You eliminate unnecessary IT integration and unnecessary IT resources. And at the same time, you can make the processes that the employees and the managers go through much more efficiently. 
 And there's a further benefit from an analytics or decision-making perspective that the information is all together, which makes reporting and visualization as possible. So those we find are actually driving it. And as I -- in my kind of longish type of talk today. Then the macro in many ways is a big wave, and we're riding that wave successfully. So a lot of that has actually become a tailwind to our business. 
Leagh Turner: If I could just add 2 things, Raimo, I'll say -- to echo David's last point, market-leading companies with strong balance sheets are focusing on the fundamentals and they're investing. That's just the basics. And we're seeing that at the top of our funnel. 
 The second thing I would say, just to answer your question very directly, you asked about deployment strategies. I mean, we cited in our sales wins in our press release a humanitarian aid organization in Australia with 27,800 employees with plans to double. So they go in with one tranche and then they expand to the rest of their organization. We also cited one of the largest auto manufacturers in the world, 8,000 employees in Canada with plans to expand. We talked about this a little bit last quarter as well. But that's a very, very common trend in our business that global multinationals look at taking bite-sized pieces. They make a holistic commitment. They roll them out one region at a time, generating results and using that result to drive further growth and efficiency. 
Matthew Wells: And our next question comes from Robert Simmons of D.A. Davidson. 
Robert Simmons: I was wondering could you update us on the ideal marketplace? 
David Ossip: Yes. The progress is going quite nicely. We're in the phase where we now are signing up customers. We expect to launch it towards the end of the year. 
Robert Simmons: Got it. Great. And then can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of the sales cycles? How much are the elongated relative to normal? Are you seeing any plans of that improving or getting worse? 
David Ossip: I don't think there's any real change. The only difference is that you typically have to run a couple of extra processes with the clients. If you do [Technical Difficulty] with the European clients, it's going to be a GPA process around data residency. There's obviously now a cyber piece that typically you have to go with as well. So as long as you basically go through the processes in parallel, you're not really seeing elongated sales cycles. 
Matthew Wells: And our next question is going to come from Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo. 
Michael Turrin: I just wanted to spend some time around what's assumed with the outlook for the rest of the year. I think the Q1 results are clean and you fielded a number of questions on those. But just any commentary you can provide on what you're expecting from employment trends? It seems like those are holding in steady. So is it fair to assume that, that is also what's assumed in the guide for the rest of the year? And then any color on just how you're thinking about the mix of growth from new customers' expansion or any additional drivers you'd flag for us just in thinking through the rest of the year? 
David Ossip: Yes. Look, we're not being an economist, so we're basically holding the employment levels rather constant for the remainder of the year. Obviously, we did see some tailwinds come into Q1, but we're not assuming that continues for the year. We're focusing, as Leagh pointed out, in the cross-sales across the actual base and the focus on new customers, investments with the SIs accelerating their generation of pipe and their ability to implement the actual product to get us to revenue quicker. 
Matthew Wells: And we'll take our last question from Dan Jester of BMO. 
Daniel Jester: So to start with, maybe I wanted to -- you to expand on the comments you made in the prepared remarks about the tailwinds from compliance and reporting. It feels like in Europe, in particular, that the compliance or reporting piece is going to get a lot more stringent over the next couple of years. So as you think about sort of adding new customers and expanding that new customer pipeline, is compliance and reporting, how much of that alone can be sort of a driver of a new conversation and then it expands? Or is the conversation always going to start with pay or workforce management and compliance is a piece that fits in nicely? 
David Ossip: So what I would say about compliance is that it gets us to the finish line very quickly that many of the other players in market really don't have the same capabilities that we do around compliance. And as people go deep into the actual product, they can understand what is truly meant about compliance. 
 And now remember, compliance is multifaceted today. You've got the basic wage in our compliance. And if companies aren't compliant from a wage in our perspective, the liability that they carry is very, very high. There is a piece around internal audit and SOX compliance and making sure that you actually have a system that is able to be used and to actually report correctly to your audit committee and your external audits is very important. 
 There's a HR reporting compliance, which in all the different geos, the various types of HR reports and employment reports that have to go to the various types of geos. There is obviously the cyber piece that flows into that as well. If you're dealing with Europe as well, they have data residency requirements, which you also have to adhere to, which is both where the actual data is hosted and second, who is allowed to actually see that organization typically tied to where that person actually resides as well. And on top of that, there's effectively the -- does the vendor have enough processes that are audited and conformed to the required standards. 
 You also get into various types of geos compliance by function. Like in Germany, there is effectively payroll compliance standards that you have to adhere and to report to as well. We definitely do have an advantage in compliance. Leagh, do you want to talk about the other ones? 
Leagh Turner: Yes. I mean I think the only other thing I would say is, first of all, Gartner rates us #1 in compliance, so just to attest to David's point. Second, you can imagine, right, we sell to a variety of different personas, CFOs, CHROs, heads of operations in every jurisdiction, frankly, in which we operate. And each of them have different needs. And as I mentioned before, in this macro, buyers are looking to consolidate point solutions and platform players with lots of different inroads to capture value and release value for our customers are winning, and it's a zero-sum budget game. So they're all taking a look at the opportunities that we bring to bear. 
Daniel Jester: Great. And then if I can just squeeze one last one in quickly. On wallet go lives, if I do my math correctly, it seems like it was a slower pace in the first quarter than you had for a while. Anything you'd call out there? 
David Ossip: We're focused mostly on penetration or increase in the eligibility of the wallets across the actual base. But if I look at actual loads, they're up 3x relative to last year. So we loaded, I think, about $350 million inside the quarter. So we've now passed $1.5 billion in terms of our loads onto the actual wallet. 
Matthew Wells: Thank you, everyone. That concludes our conference call.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-08 17:00:00) =====
Matthew Wells: [Audio Gap] 
 Matt Wells, Head of Investor Relations. And on the call today, we have our Co-CEOs, David Ossip and Leagh Turner; and our CFO, Noemie Heuland. 
 [Operator Instructions] Before I hand the call over to David, I want to remind everyone that our commentary may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause Ceridian's results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectation. A description of some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as the cautionary statements in our filings. 
 Additionally, over the course of this call, we will reference non-GAAP measures to describe our performance. Please review our earnings press release and filings with the SEC for our rationale behind the use of non-GAAP measures and for a full reconciliation of these GAAP to non-GAAP metrics. Both our earnings press release and SEC filings are available on the Ceridian Investor Relations website. As a final note, a replay of this call will also be available on our Investor Relations website. 
 And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to David. 
David Ossip: Thank you, Matt, and thank you all for joining us today for our Q4 earnings call. Today, I'll discuss our exceptional results for the quarter and fiscal year and talk to our continued strength in technology that positions us for 2023 and beyond. Leagh will give more information on our successful customer implementations and recent organizational changes that will help drive efficiency and continue to grow. Noemie will then provide insights on our Q4 performance, 2023 full year guidance and reaffirm our medium-term goal becoming a $2 billion revenue company with industry-leading cloud recurring gross margins of 80% and adjusted EBITDA up 30% by 2025. I'll begin with our financial results. I'm happy to report that we closed Q4 and fiscal year 2022 with strong momentum and financial performance.
 For Q4, we exceeded our guidance across all metrics. On a constant currency basis, Dayforce recurring revenue grew 35% and 24%, excluding float. Our adjusted EBITDA was $67.7 million or 20.1% of revenue with cloud recurring gross margins expanding by 250 basis points on an adjusted basis to 76.2%. Cash flow from operating activities were $41.8 million, a significant improvement from a year ago. 
 Our annual Dayforce gross retention rate remains best in class at 97.1%, and our cloud annual recurring revenue surpassed $1 billion, growing 34% year-over-year. In 2022, Ceridian demonstrated efficiency in its operations while achieving impressive revenue growth and enhancing profitability. We also saw healthy sales growth in 2022 from both new customers and add-on sales to the base. This provides an excellent setup for 2023 as evidenced by our strong 2023 fiscal year guidance of Dayforce recurring revenue ex float growth at constant currency of 25% to 27% and adjusted EBITDA of 24% to 25%. 
 I'm very proud of what our team has achieved and the value that we have all created for our customers. On this note, I would like to thank our employees and partners for their commitment and contributions to another successful quarter and fiscal year. It is our team, our differentiated tech and just the sheer size of the addressable global HCM market that drives my optimism, my confidence and my motivation to seize the growth opportunity ahead of us. 
 Our brand promise of Makes Work Life Better has never been more relevant. This has been evidenced in the hundreds of customer conversations that I have had throughout the year. It is evident that every company is striving to boost efficiency and productivity by adapting to the new reality of work, and our emphasis on providing tangible value through actual, verifiable investment returns has resulted in numerous customer success stories and increased demand for Dayforce. 
 Next, I will discuss our product innovation that continues to set us apart in the market. First, the size of our target market continues to expand as we add new modules to the Dayforce platform and by expanding our global payroll capabilities. Today, we offer the most comprehensive HCM suite in the market that is also unique in its payroll capabilities for 57 countries. This allows us to deliver a differentiated solution to enterprise and global customers. 
 Another significant area of differentiation is that Dayforce is a single solution with a single database and single continuous calculation engine. This means that Dayforce offers greater efficiencies and compliance than any other solution in the market. It is our continuous calculation engine that enabled us to launch Dayforce Wallet, which lets employees get paid when they want, improving their financial wellness and reducing employee turnover and cost for our customers. 
 Over 1,450 customers, an increase of 500 year-over-year have signed up for Dayforce Wallet, and 889, an increase of 462 year-over-year are live. The average registration rate is trending above 45% of eligible users and the typical Wallet user interact [indiscernible] about 25 times a month. Dayforce Wallet remains a key competitive differentiator with high attachment rates to new sales and frequent usage among employees. 
 We expect Dayforce Wallet revenues of approximately $14 million in 2023, which is growing over 100% year-over-year. On the data side, intelligence is central to Dayforce and we continue to integrate AI seamlessly into the platform. Our newly released intelligent search allows managers and employees to get answers to their questions easily and quickly. Also, our Dayforce People analytics features provides customers with metrics and analytics across the entire employee life cycle, covering DEI, performance, compensation, [indiscernible] benefits and more. 
 We have also added intelligent automation today for recruiting, making the talent acquisition process more efficient and accurate. And we have improved our best-in-class user experience to meet changing work needs, including a focus on mobile experiences. With the [indiscernible] Mobile Benefits Enrollment, employees can fully manage the benefits on their mobile devices. And the Experience Hub, which we released last year allows our customers to easily put their branding on the application and personalized content and communications for specific groups. 
 And we continue to offer differentiated features at the very core of Dayforce that extend across the suite to meet the demands of the modern workplace. For example, our Dayforce skills engine, the backbone of Dayforce talent intelligence creates an open standard-based approach to skills. It is a skilled engine that allows us to match candidates to open jobs, and we are using this tech to build the ideal talent marketplace. We shared this upcoming solution at Insights. It will help customers increase the flexibility of their staffing models and adapt to the future world of work. 
 And finally, Ceridian Tax Services has always stood out due to its competitiveness. In 2022, we modernized the architecture of our North American tax systems, and now customers can access the tax submission through the same technology as the Dayforce cloud platform. This will enhance our differentiation and drive more growth. Once more, we are very proud of the progress we are making with our distinctive product line, which once again has been recognized as a leader in the 2022 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud HCM Suites for 1,000-plus employee enterprises, with us being the only pure-play HCM vendor named as such. In conclusion, our product innovation, broad reach and impressive performance this past year gives us great assurance in our ability to achieve sustained profitable growth. Now I'll turn the call over to Leagh. Leagh, the floor is yours. 
Leagh Turner: Thank you, David. Like you, I am so pleased that Ceridian continues to perform beyond expectations and even in this complex operating environment. Last year, we adjusted our business to a more balanced growth and profitability plan. We shifted our operating model to leverage our APJ resources, and this allowed us to continue investing in and growing the business. And in 2022, Ceridian operated above the Rule of 40, with total revenue growing by 24% in constant currency and adjusted EBITDA being 20.1%. 
 And as David mentioned, our guide for 2023 continues to improve on the Rule of 40. On the investment side, we continue to hire meaningfully and especially so in sales, marketing and engineering, which has allowed us to drive the innovation that David spoke to and the sales results that I am going to speak to. And we did all of this while at the same time, meaningfully globalizing our business, and the way in which we support and service our customers, driving customer NPS scores up across both our support and services businesses, while also decreasing the number of support tickets logged in year by 13% and maintaining our world-class retention rates of 97.1%. 
 We grew our partner ecosystem significantly in 2022, now with more than 170 partners globally. Today, more than 40% of our global bookings are supported by partners and 14% of our kickoffs in year were also completed by partners, and that's a trend that will continue to increase significantly in 2022 and beyond. We are seeing the effect of our partners in our pipeline as well. Our pipeline coverage is strong and the maturity of our pipeline and level of qualification is high. In 2022, we saw triple-digit growth in our global markets, and our average overall deal size increased by 22% in 2022, signaling our growth upmarket while maintaining our leadership in small- and medium-sized companies. 
 Companies of all sizes, segments and parts of the globe are reaching for digital transformation, efficiency and globalization of their employee base to drive the efficiencies required to support growth. And these tailwinds are not going anywhere. In fact, IDC says that technology budgets are growing in 2023, with SaaS spend increasing by approximately 15% year-on-year. 
 Our growth levers will continue to prove to be the right ones at the right time. We entered the year with a seasoned and efficient sales organization. We have reps with time and territory and strong pipelines, particularly as we continue to make demonstrable strides in the large enterprise market. Over 25% of our sales were back to the base in fiscal year 2022 and 39% of our customers have bought our Dayforce suite. Coupled with retention rates in excess of 97%, this positions us well for durable growth over the medium term. These are proof points that our platform strategy works. Continued innovation and happy, satisfied customers are the combination that drives profitable, long-term growth. Now let me get into some of the specifics of our Q4 customer wins and go-lives. 
 From a customer wins perspective, a global auto parts manufacturer with 40,000 employees in North America chose to further unify its workforce on a single HCM platform with Dayforce. This deal was brought to us by a partner, and the business process transformation that will follow will be done by both the partner and Ceridian, a multinational hotel and restaurant company based in the U.K. selected Dayforce to fuel its growth and transformation by leveraging a modern, intuitive and engaging experience for its 38,000 employees. 
 A U.S. consumer goods manufacturer with 35,000 employees globally chose Dayforce for its Latin America and Asia Pacific operations, standardizing on a single global solution for payroll and workforce management and driving a more efficient and lean organization. A major global airline based in Canada with 22,000 employees focused on driving efficiency in their global payroll and WFM processes, selected Ceridian and one of our key global partners to transform this part of the business. This deal was brought to us by that same partner. We also took live some notable companies in the last quarter. A global professional services firm, recently went live with Dayforce, streamlining payroll and taxes for 55,000 employees in the U.S. and Canada. 
 This customer went from signing to live in less than 9 months. They had very sophisticated requirements and excellent teaming between both Ceridian and the customer made this possible. They also happen to be one of our partners. One of the world's largest express transportation and shipping companies migrated to Dayforce for a modern payroll experience for 12,000 employees. A leading global retailer successfully migrated to Dayforce for HR, payroll and workforce management for 10,000 employees in the United Kingdom; and a major American cargo and passenger airline launched Dayforce for payroll, time and attendance and managed benefits for 7,400 employees. 
 For those of you following us for some time, you will have noted that virtually all of the customers mentioned have employees in excess of 10,000. A few years ago, this would have been an anomaly. And now it's the norm. We've been relentlessly focused on scaling this business, and this is one of the results. Speaking of scale, as we look ahead to fiscal year 2023, I'm very pleased to share the promotion of Steve Holdridge to President, Global Customer and revenue operations. In this new role, Steve will lead our entire global field operations. We have always known that this was the structure we intended to move toward, and this is the right time to bring our sales, revenue and customer functions together to drive toward our growth goals and to continue delivering the quantifiable value that we promised through every single touch point of the customer experience. 
 To support this new structure, we've also allocated additional resources to marketing in support of our brand and go-to-market efforts. We are providers of real business transformation. And at a time when every single customer everywhere is searching for a partner to help them convert efficiency into growth, Steve is absolutely the right leader to bring these teams together and to help us meet this moment of opportunity. His track record is exemplary, both since he joined Ceridian and in his years prior to joining us. A true global transformation leader, well known in the industry and well loved inside our 4 walls. I would like to personally take this opportunity to congratulate Steve on behalf of all of us at Ceridian for this latest endorsement of his leadership. 
 Before I turn it over to Noemie, I would like to thank Rocky Subramanian who will leave our business on March 3. Rocky was instrumental in leading our revenue organization to truly sell the value of transformation working side-by-side with Steve to ensure that the quantifiable value we commit to in the sales process is realized when our customer goes live and again, when they renew. He set us up for this next stage in our evolution, and we are grateful for his numerous contributions and we wish him well. 
 In closing, the demand environment remains healthy. Our pipeline is strong. The market opportunity is growing. Our ecosystem is expanding and succeeding and our renewal rates remain best-in-class. When customers reach for transformation and sustained efficiency, we are the answer that powers their growth, accelerates their productivity and reduces their cost. Above all else, we have the right team, further aligned to deliver who I would be completely remiss if I didn't stop to think, along with our customers and our shareholders for their steadfast commitment to our brand promise and purpose to make work life better. 
 And with that, I will turn it over to Noemie to walk you more deeply through the quarter and the year and to review our guidance. Noemie? 
Noemie Heuland: Thanks, Leagh. I'd like to provide additional color on our fourth quarter performance and full year 2023 guidance, both of which are detailed in the press release published on our Investor Relations website. As David highlighted, our fourth quarter results exceeded guidance across all revenue and profitability metrics despite persistent FX headwinds. 
 Notably, at constant currency, Dayforce recurring revenue grew 35% and total revenue grew 23%. Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.1% exceeded the high end of our guidance range, and operating cash flows was $41.9 million above Q4 last year, driven in part by revenue upside and operating margin improvements. 
 I am very pleased to report that on an adjusted basis, the cloud recurring gross margin was 76.2%, an increase of 250 basis points year-over-year. In the month of December, we also benefited from a $3 million change in estimate of sales commission amortization period. We will now amortize our deferred commissions over a 10-year period, a change of estimate from a 5-year period, reflecting higher customer retention rates and length of our customer relationship. This revised estimate is also embedded in our fiscal year '23 guidance. 
 Turning to fiscal year '23 guidance. I want to note that we expect about 85 basis points of FX headwinds to Dayforce recurring revenue ex float for the full year, with the primary impact being felt in the first half of the year then moderating in the second half. The same trend will persist across total revenue, where we expect about 110 basis points of total FX headwinds. For the full year, Dayforce recurring revenue, excluding float is expected to be in the range of $936 million to $946 million, growing 26% at the midpoint at constant currency. 
 As noted in our press release, we have modernized our tax infrastructure and now provide our North America tech solutions under the Dayforce platform. As such, this modernization effort in our tech business is expected to contribute approximately 460 basis points of Dayforce recurring ex float revenue growth in fiscal year '23. In addition, I would like to note that our largest enterprise deals take over 12 months to achieve full run rate type of revenue. And our float revenue guidance reflects a more normalized interest environment. 
 As the pace of rate increases moderates, we expect less upward variability as compared to fiscal year 2022. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $360 million to $375 million or margins of 25% at the midpoint. Our guidance assumes a degree of float reinvestment back into the business as well as continued scale, primarily driven by cloud recurring gross margin expansion. As it relates to operating cash flows, we expect an adjusted EBITDA conversion ratio in the mid-50s for the full year 2023. Commensurate with progress made in '22 and as implied by our 2023 guidance, we remain committed to our medium-term goals. 
 In closing, I'd like to echo both David and Leagh in saying that we're very proud of the progress we made in 2022 and are eager to continue executing on our shared vision in 2023. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Matt to open it for Q&A. 
Matthew Wells: Our first question comes from Mark Marcon from Baird. 
Mark Marcon: Congratulations. When I was at Insights, you have a number of large enterprise clients that I talked to that were very complementary. And a lot of them were global in nature. And then I noticed with the sales highlights you're mentioning all of the various global deals that you've signed. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the global marketplace as an opportunity relative to single country opportunities? It sounds like your competitive advantages really shine with regards to the multinational deals. And obviously, that would speak to bigger deals as well. What are the key drivers in terms of the growth there? Is it just the native payroll and everything being able to translate smoothly? Is it the single database? Is it the continuous calculation engine? And to what extent is Dayforce Wallet attractive internationally? 
David Ossip: Thanks, Mark, and great to speak with you. What I would say about this is that most organizations are now looking at how they can transform their companies to take advantage and be relevant in today's world. On that line, one of the initiatives that most organizations are looking at is how they can move to shared services on a global operating model basis. 
 And so we're finding that all organizations beyond a certain sites are looking at using the Dayforce technology because it provides them with a global operating model for their people. It allows them to have payroll process in a single system. It allows them to do the analytics altogether in constant currency, and it allows them to work on areas like standardization and shared services to achieve there more strategic initiatives. And so we're finding that's resonating very nicely inside the market. Leagh, what would you add to that? 
Leagh Turner: First of all, Mark, it's nice to hear from you. Thank you. And I would echo what David said, and I would just refer you to our press release where we talk about global customers that are sort of beginning 1 country at a time. I think that that's something we're seeing as well. You're right to say, David, that companies are globalizing in order to achieve efficiency, but what we're seeing in our pipeline is that many very, very large global multinationals, we refer to a global auto parts manufacturer with 40,000 employees in North America. They actually have 350,000 employees globally. We refer to a global professional services firm with 55,000 employees in the U.S. and Canada that we brought live. They have 276,000 employees globally. So this land and expand strategy is a huge part of our go-to-market, and you should expect to see more of that over time. 
Mark Marcon: That's great. And can you just mention to what extent the Dayforce Wallet capabilities are helping? I listened to a large European staffing company, Randstad just put in place early wage access for their European clients. So I'm wondering to what extent we're starting to see some traction outside of the U.S. as it relates to early wage access. 
David Ossip: Mark, if you look on LinkedIn or social media, you'll see that we did the big launch of the Dayforce Wallet for the U.K. populations, and it was a tremendously well-attended event with tremendous excitement in market. In the U.K. and inside Europe, typically, the payroll periods are monthly as opposed to biweekly or weekly as they are in North America. So there is a big demand for it inside the market. We obviously are doing it in a pragmatic way because of the partnerships we have to have along the movement of money. And so we are very encouraged what we're seeing currently with the U.K. kind of adoption of the system. 
 And as we bring Germany live, we'll probably look towards that geo and adding it. We also obviously are looking towards the ANZ market where there is a requirement as well for early wage access as well within the APJ market. 
Matthew Wells: And our next question comes from Mark Murphy of JPMorgan. 
Mark Murphy: Yes. Thank you very much. And congratulations on the very strong guidance. First of all, it's great to see the $40 billion expected wallet revenue next year. I was curious if that is assuming this continued registration rate of around 45% of the eligible users? Or do you see potential perhaps to convert some of the holdouts and maybe what would be the -- what are the hurdles to get that to happen? And then I have a quick follow-up. 
David Ossip: Yes. So Mark, honors, it's still early days for the actual wallet. I'm not sure if we got the number correct, it's $14 million, not $40 million in the 2023 time frame. It's growing well beyond 100% year-over-year. If I look at the actual volumes of loads, we've crossed over $1 billion a few months ago. And if I look at the daily loads or the number of times the application is used now, we're probably around 30,000 to 40,000 loads per day. So it's growing very, very quickly. But from a revenue percentage contribution, it comes in now, I don't know, what is it about less -- about 1%, I guess, of the overall size of the company. 
Mark Murphy: Okay. Understood. David, thank you for clarifying. I didn't hear it phonetically on the call properly. Thank you for clarifying that. As a follow-up, how did you interpret the recent monthly nonfarm payrolls data? It was a stunning number. Unemployment rate was the lowest since, I think, the late 1960s. And I believe leisure and hospitality were the strongest there where you do have relatively high exposure. Is that something you view as kind of noisy or anomalous? Or do you think it's instructive on the overall employment backdrop that you're seeing today? 
David Ossip: I didn't really talk about the seasonality of those particular segments. And you remember that in December, you typically have the highest level of employment in hospitality and retail. Typically, you'll see a drop-off of that as you go through Q1 and then begins to build up again starting with Q2. So I didn't see -- I wasn't surprised by the numbers. And remember, we have pretty live data when it comes to employment numbers by segment, by geo as well. So it's what we had expected. 
Matthew Wells: And our next question comes from Bryan Bergin of Cowen. 
Bryan Bergin: I guess I want to start with demand. Just are you seeing any KPIs that would suggest recessionary behavior or imminent slowdown? Anything like that? Can you comment on maybe new business momentum through January, please? 
David Ossip: It's kind of a strange time. Usually, on the sales cycle, sales activities, after Thanksgiving, you typically see a bit of a slowdown that continues through December and into January. Last year, we didn't see that. The Solution Advisory team was exceptionally busy throughout the month of December towards the very, very end. And then came right back very, very high active sales activities in the beginning of January. 
 So there seems to be still a very robust market for our type of system. What I will say though is I think the inspection that is going into every single deal, the amount of diligence that each and every customer is doing is definitely up several at times and the focus on kind of quantifiable value, in other words, delivering a very hard IRR to the company has become very important in order to get the approvals for the projects. But on the macro side, I can't speak anything specifically that talks to the slowdown in the economy. 
Bryan Bergin: Okay. That's helpful. And then pivoting to margin here. So the cloud recurring ex float gross margin, solid close here. Where do you expect that to land in 2023? And then just on the change in commission expense amortization. Can you just give us a sense of what the '23 impact is from that? 
David Ossip: Yes. So I'll start with the latter. If you look at kind of the month of December, Noemie, I think it was about a $3 million benefit. 
Noemie Heuland: Benefit. 
David Ossip: Benefit inside that. So I assume we could just extrapolate for the year. In terms of the gross margin on recurring. As you mentioned, we ended the year on an adjusted basis at 76.2%, which was up about 250 basis points. If we look towards Q1, we would expect that it would go up probably between 1% to 2% relative to Q1 of last year. And for the entire year, I would expect us to probably make progress towards the rule -- to the 80% target that we're hitting by 2025. And so you'll probably see it go up by about another percentage also over the course of the year. 
Noemie Heuland: Yes. Bryan, I think the best way to look at it, if you look at our cloud recurring gross margin progression, we've always said that we're aiming to be close to 80% by 2026, and we're going to make progress every year, and that's going to be pretty linear until then. And when it comes to float, you may remember that when we come out of 2022, we had a pretty significant increase in our cloud recurring gross margin with the work we did in automation as well as using our shared services centers in APJ. So we continue to see the benefits of that throughout 2023, but you'll see less of an impact and progression in 2023. It's going to be more linear going forward until we reach 80%. 
David Ossip: Just Mark, one thing that I would do on the long-term range plan is that I do believe the 30% adjusted EBITDA target with the sales commission changes moves to -- by the end of 2025 as opposed to 2026. So it moves the -- it brings it in by about a year. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question comes from Bhavin Shah of Deutsche Bank. 
Bhavin Shah: Congrats on a strong quarter. Just following up on some of the exact changes that you made just on the promotion of Steve, can you just maybe elaborate a little bit more on why you think it's best to consolidate the role of CRO under him versus maybe replacing Rocky? And then how are you thinking about or handicapping maybe the potential for any disruption, if at all? 
Leagh Turner: Yes, I'll take that. First of all, nice to talk to you, Bhavin. Thank you very much. I'll say a few things that we noted during the call. We -- David and I talked about this, I don't know, David, what, 4 years ago about moving toward this structure eventually. In order to be able to do it, we needed stability and scale in each of the customer-facing functions. And we knew that we had to go on a journey to be able to do that. But it's a structure and a target model that we always wanted to move to because of the fact that we allow -- it allows us to have like complete full visibility and alignment throughout the entire customer life cycle.  
 We care a lot about delivering quantifiable value to our customers. So this allows us to set the measure for quantifiable value in the sales process to bring it to life through the renewal -- or excuse me, through the go-live process and then to measure it consistently throughout the renewal process. And we believe that, that will make us market differentiated. And it will allow us to be the transformation partner, not sales partner, services partner or support partner, but actual life cycle transformation partner that we believe that we can be and that we can focus deeply on value. 
 I will say, I think that there will be 0 disruptions. Steve is here with us, as is Greg George, who leads North American sales. And as you would know, that's the lion's share of our business today and they have been well aligned all the way out through this entire last couple of years and through this change. I would also say Rocky did an awesome job. He was with us for a couple of years. He did exactly what we asked him to do, which was to upgrade and globalize our team to increase our value-based selling and transformation-based selling. 
 And he and Steve have been partners for the last couple of years, really working on that quantifiable value throughout the entire customer life cycle. And I think he's built a great culture, great leaders. And I think that there will be little-to-no disruption at all. And so what we've been able to do as a result of this change is to take some of the savings and efficiency and drive it back into our business, investing in brands and telling our story. So I think, frankly, we're going to see forward momentum. As a result, the team is super happy, and we're just like onwards and upwards. 
Bhavin Shah: Appreciate the valuable response, Leagh. Just maybe 1 question on float to follow up. Can you just maybe help us understand maybe the delta between the 1Q guidance of $45 million versus the full year of $150 million which roughly implies $100 million for the following 3 quarters. I would have thought if anything, that should be stable as we go into 2Q and beyond. Anything that we should keep in mind as it relates to this going forward? 
Noemie Heuland: So on Q1, you got to -- there's a bit of seasonality going on, higher volumes in Q1 with the end of the year processing and the tax volume as well. And then we've reflected the most recent interest rate environment. But as we -- as I said on my prepared remarks, I think the upward variability for 2023 is going to be a little bit of less magnitude than it was in 2022, simply because the interest rate environment starts to normalize, and we factored that into our guidance for '23. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question comes from Robert Simmons of D.A. Davidson. 
Robert Simmons: I was wondering what countries of [indiscernible] you to add native payroll to that you might in the relative near term? 
David Ossip: I'm sorry, I didn't quite hear the question. 
Leagh Turner: What countries will we add native payroll to in the relative near term, I think. 
David Ossip: Well, the focus at the moment is to get Germany online. We're starting to do the implementation of the charter accounts this year. And as we go through, it will go through a limited release to GA by the end of the year. We've already, as you know, got quite a backlog for customers in Germany. At the same time, we are extending our footprint across APJ with the countries that we already have acquired. 
 So we launched Singapore last year, and there are a few geos around that are very similar in nature to Singapore that we probably will add. And we're continuing to invest in our global payroll interface which allows us to, if you like, bring the engines, as you know, we've already acquired into the Dayforce platform. 
Robert Simmons: Got it. That makes sense. And then can you talk about the competitive landscape? Have you seen any changes in the last 3 to 6 months that you'd call out? Or is it pretty much business as usual? 
Leagh Turner: You know that we play in a variety of different segments, right? So I would say it's not changed demonstrably. But we're playing -- in the emerging -- we had great growth in the emerging market, very traditional competitors there. In the mid-market, which is very clouded space, I would say we continue to see relatively the same competitive landscape. But when we get up into the top end now, I would say, typically, we see the 3 large ERPs who we are now in the Gartner Magic Quadrant leadership quadrant alone with. And many of our wins that were noted in the press release, the global auto parts manufacturer, as an example, was a win against UKG, Workday, SAP and ADP. 
 When you look at the deal that we did in Australia and New Zealand, it was actually a multimillion dollar deal done with a global multinational that does provisions of explosives and oil and gas -- for the oil and gas and mining markets. That was a deal that was done in 17 days, competitive, against ADP, partner-led. But I would say the one thing that you're seeing more demonstrably than perhaps in the past is that because we're working with partners so much, our deals are really prequalified, and we're not competing to the same degree that we might have in the past and our sales cycles are accelerating. As a result, we're able to maintain our value, not only to our customer, but to Ceridian. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho. 
Sitikantha Panigrahi: Congratulations. Great quarter. David, when you look at enterprise momentum, it's very impressive. And I remember you guys started investing pre-COVID. But the last few quarters, we are seeing this large deal size momentum. So how is the pipeline right now heading into 2023. These enterprise deals versus '22 last year. And remind us like what's the deal cycle time for these large deals? 
David Ossip: So thanks very much for that. So look, the metric that I would point to, which Leagh spoke to is that the average deal size went up by 22% last year. There are a few things that are running kind of in parallel would be here. First of all, we have a kind of in-seat large enterprise and enterprise sales team. And so the pipeline that has been generated by that team and the business development organization over the last year means that we go into 2023 with an enterprise pipeline that is several times larger than the one that we went into at the beginning of 2022. 
 The second is we've made tremendous progress with the system integrators, and we're seeing more large deals being sourced by the system integrators. Leagh spoke about a few of those, the large global automotive manufacturer that was sourced by one of the large SI.  The Canadian airline organization, That was also sourced by another very large SI. 
 The chemical organization based out of Australia that was also sourced by another SI. And so we're seeing now the pipeline being positively influenced by the SI channels, which, as you know, we've been investing in for probably the last 3 or 4 years. So when you take all of those together, we go into year with a much healthier and much more robust sales pipeline. In terms of the average deal size, it really varies. If I look at the chemical company, that was a lightning quick. It probably was somewhere like 12 to 16 weeks from identification to actually contracting. 
 If I look at the airline company, which also is about 20,000 employees, I think that was probably about 6 months at most in terms of the time to move it through the pipeline. But I think those are outliers. As you would expect in the large enterprise space, it would be typically 12 to 24 months to mature those types of opportunities. One other point I would make on the large enterprise size has to do with the implementation. And we've gotten very good at taking very large populations live very quickly. 
 The large consulting company that Leagh spoke about, which is upwards of about 50,000 or so employees, the project kicked off in April, and they went live in December. And that's not an anomaly at all. So I'm very encouraged with what we're seeing in the large enterprise space. 
Sitikantha Panigrahi: That's great color. And as a follow-up to that, you talked about SIs getting involved in the deals. Is that the reason why the professional services revenue, Dayforce professional services revenue was up 3% year-over-year? Or is there anything else? And how should we think about professional services revenue for 2023? 
David Ossip: Yes, that is correct. I don't think it's -- I think 3% you're talking about is inside the actual quarter. But if you look at it for a fiscal basis, it was actually up by 14% year-over-year. But yes, we are trying to move more and more of the implementations to the system integrators. And the number of projects that the system integrators are now -- primarily, I think, is 15% of the overall amount. 
Leagh Turner: 14%. 
David Ossip: 14%. And so we would expect that to grow quite significantly again in 2023. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Pfau of William Blair. 
Matthew Pfau: I wanted to ask a few on the ideal talent marketplace. So how are you thinking about this opportunity in terms of its size. When would you expect this to start contributing to revenue meaningfully? And then how do you go about sourcing labor for this product in a tight labor environment? 
David Ossip: So thanks for the question on that. We're still building out the actual products. It will be some time before we see a revenue benefit from it. In terms of where we are, we expect to be able to take the charter accounts live in the Q3, Q4 time line. In terms of the sourcing of the actual labor, there are already 2 classifications of people. We call the first known employees, which would be the active employees of the company as well as the alumni of that company. 
 And then the second categorization will be something we call trusted employees, which are people that we have done the background screen for, we've done the --  used the Dayforce skills engine to validate their particular skills so we can do the actual job matching. In terms of the identification of the charter accounts, we've been quite active in speaking to our clients and getting them to a stage where we should be in a position to start contracting with the first few customers in the next few months. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo. 
Michael Turrin: Appreciate it. Employee growth on the platform is still strong this year at 17%. You mentioned the environment you're seeing still looks healthy. Can you walk through some of the assumptions you're making on the employment environment in the fiscal '23 guide? And then secondarily, there's a tax migration impact mentioned in the press release as part of the Dayforce revenue guide. Noemie, maybe you can just give us some details on what's driving that? Is that something you're expecting as the user base matures? Or maybe what's driving that now? 
Noemie Heuland: Sure. So in terms of employment assumptions, David referred to it earlier, we're expecting the employment trends to normalize. Remember, in last year's Q1, we still had little bit of peak-up from the employment level recovery from the COVID period. So that's completely normalized now. We're expecting a slight decline in Q1 in employment levels, seasonal trends and then peaking back up again. So that's for the -- that's what's embedded in our guidance for 2023. 
 And on the tax migration, we've talked about the effect, and we -- David can talk about this, too, but we've modernized our existing infrastructure. This is no different than what we've done in the past for our Bureau customers where we migrate them from an on-premise types of delivery into cloud. And that really enabled us to generate a lot more profitable margin with the tax customers as well. And we classify the revenue as cloud and Dayforce recurring. That contributes to about 460 basis points of growth in 2023. And we have an aggressive marketing plan as well as branding activities to really grow that market and that business because there's really big demand for it. That's a competitive differentiator for us, and customers actually appreciate the services offering. David, do you want to add something on that? 
David Ossip: Yes. I think you did it well. It's no different than what we did with all of the legacy payroll business. So over the last number of years, we've actually been rewriting the tax component into the Dayforce platform such that it becomes a true cloud system, but also that it allows us to get a foothold in the actual customers that gives us future growth and hence, the branding exercises and the marketing exercise that Noemie is talking about. 
 A few things, though, on the gross profit. We were able, as we did the actual movement into the Dayforce kind of tech stack to improve the gross profit -- the gross margins on the recurring tax business up quite significantly as well. And so the gross margins on the tax recurring are now within a few basis points of what we see on the entire Dayforce platform. We also did make some changes to some of the services. For example, things like printing. We no longer do that directly. So kind of the low-margin types of services. We worked out other ways to deliver that to customers outside of Ceridian. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jackson Ader or MoffettNathanson. 
Unknown Analyst: The first one is on the deal size increase up, I think, 22% year over year. I'm curious whether you can parse out how much of that was attributable to the customers being larger, like customers having more employees versus maybe holding employees steady, but actually uptake of more product. 
David Ossip: Look, we've got 5 growth vectors for the business. The first one is that we acquire new customers. The second is that we increase the actual platform. We go back to the base and we upsell them. As Leigh pointed out, 25%, I think, of the sales that we did with inside fiscal 2022 were back to the base. 
 And then the third growth vector is that we go into the enterprise and the large enterprise space. And as you can see from the list of customers and such, we've obviously done that very effectively. So it's really kind of looking at the growth as a rectangle. And we're looking at effectively growing the area all the time by selling more modules and at the same time, sell into large organizations. 
Unknown Analyst: Okay. All right. And then just a quick follow-up on the wallet. Any expected impact or quantifiable impact on margins that you can talk about for the wallet, either in '22 or on the expectation for that $140 million in revenue in '23. 
David Ossip: Not $140 million, again, $14 million, 1-4. Obviously, you have to stop mumbling when I speak. 
Unknown Analyst: Sorry about that. Yes. Got it now. 
David Ossip: Yes. In terms of the margins, the margins obviously go up as the scale of the business actually goes up as well. I think if we look at it at an overall probability, it is kind of in line with the rest of the Dayforce application. But I would expect the profitability of that business to obviously improve. But again, it's a small business today, growing well over 100% year-over-year. And I think that growth trend will continue for some time. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research. 
Aleksandr Zukin: Guys, can you hear me okay? 
David Ossip: Nice to speak with you. . 
Aleksandr Zukin: Likewise. So excluding the $200 million in the Dayforce Wallet -- no, I'm just kidding. I guess on -- if you think about the guide for Dayforce recurring revenue, if you do actually exclude the $14 million wallet and the 450 basis points of tax migration, it does appear a little bit more conservative than your historical guidance methodology for Dayforce recurring revenue. Is that just delivered, taking account of the more volatile macro? Is it something else? .
 And just, David, also help us understand, is this a one for one, what we were charging for the tax piece on-prem now moving it into the cloud? Are you getting a cloud migration dollar boost from that as well for that service? And how much is left in that Bureau business to migrate or convert over to Dayforce. 
David Ossip: First of all, Alex, remember as a tech company, we make investments in engineering, and we do that in order to get the Dayforce recurring revenue in both the case of Dayforce Wallet and in the tax. We put significant resources into the kind of the development, if you like, of the Dayforce components for that. It's no different and us going off and building a different module and trying to get recurring revenue against it.
 So I don't think what you're saying holds because, obviously, we invested in the P&T line, product and technology in order to get the growth on the Dayforce recurring from those 2 specific modules as I would frame that. In terms of the pricing, yes, you're correct. We were able to increase the prices that we have been getting for tax over the last year. And that's when I mentioned that the margins had improved to be in line with those of Dayforce. Obviously, there's a cost savings on the infrastructure side, but there's also a revenue look that we get from that, too. 
Aleksandr Zukin: And then in terms of just the latent opportunity that still exists in that Bureau base to convert over to Dayforce or over the course of the next few years, either in tax for Bureau. 
David Ossip: No. We did it in a way that we're able to do it kind of all in. So if you actually look at the growth for Q1, it's about 550 basis points lift from that particular migration. And so if I look towards the Bureau kind of run for the year, the makeup effectively is the remaining North American payroll and fiscal 2023 is like $1.5 million to $2 million. 
 Tax all moves across over to Dayforce this year. We've got that small business Freedom product that still holds probably around the $9 million level. We have no more HRO business inside that. There's still a little bit of allocation of float that goes towards the Bureau business in the neighborhood of $1 million to $2 million. And then we have the APJ products that we will be migrating over the next number of years. And that, if I look at it for the year, in total, it's probably about $84-or-so million. 
Aleksandr Zukin: That's super helpful. Maybe just sneaking one last one in, David. How the thought process around inorganic contribution as you look at the market seems to be getting a little bit better for private valuations as you think about just generally for -- by adding incremental functionality into the business. 
David Ossip: We're not looking at doing any significant scale M&A within 2023. We're focused quite honestly, on hitting the $2 billion of revenue, the 80% gross margin on recurring and a 30% adjusted EBITDA organically. 
Operator: And we'll take our last question of the night from Raimo Lenschow, Barclays. 
Raimo Lenschow: Can you talk a little bit the enterprise wins of [indiscernible] impressive, like where -- what are you seeing there? Are there any patterns in terms of where these customers are coming from in terms of like having tried it out other cloud vendors where the [ people ] offering is not very strong, some of the old legacy stuff is getting dated and people are moving. Are there any things that you can see that kind of creates a trend here? 
David Ossip: It's right across the board. We're replacing some of the cloud vendors that you obviously know of. We're obviously replacing some of the legacy payroll bureau companies that you would expect that we've always had. We're also replacing some of the ERPs in the market, but I don't think that's changed. Look, when I look at it, I think we are differentiated in that we're the only pure-play HCM vendor in that Gartner leadership quadrant. 
 And specifically, we are #1 for compliance. We're #1 for payroll. We're #1 for customer set. But also we completely differentiated on our global capabilities, whether it be global HR, global workforce management, global payroll. So I do think we're quite unique inside the market when it comes to the large enterprise companies. And as I spoke about at the very beginning, the move of all companies of scale to shared services and globalization of the operations is just the reality of a post COVID world.  Leagh, what would you add to that? 
Leagh Turner: I think the thing I would add is that the driver is consolidation and efficiency. So in many of our wins over the course of the last quarter, we're replacing like multiple systems. I'll give you an example. The win in Australia that both David and I referred to as a replacement of 34 different systems. This is a really common trend as companies look to drive efficiency in order to be able to fuel growth. And so I would say that, that's a really key driver. 
Raimo Lenschow: Yes. Okay. And then 1 quick follow-up, more for the future around like your revenue recognition usually started when you get the customer live. Other vendors are starting actually from almost Day 1 because the client is using system integrators in the client [indiscernible].  How are you thinking about that as you evolve and as more system integrators coming on stream? Have you changed it? Are you thinking about changing that? Any help there as well. 
Leagh Turner: Yes. I mean, I'll ask Noemie to add a little bit of color, but I'll simply say that's a business model that you can imagine we're moving towards. As we partner with system integrators, we come in with a joint value proposition. We sell the software. They sell the implementation. Together, we do the transformation services. And you should expect that over the course of the next few years, that we will continue to mature that model. Noemie, what would you add? 
Noemie Heuland: No, you covered it, Leagh. We've actually started doing that a couple of years ago and some opportunities and customers have [indiscernible] that starts right upon signing the contract. We're moving in that direction. Obviously, when you sell the full suite and you have a SaaS offering that includes more ACM and additional modules on that payroll, it's obviously a bit easier to do, but the -- we're also making big strides in that model with a payroll and time and attendance customers as well. 
Operator: Thanks, Raimo. Thanks, everyone, for joining the call.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-11-02 17:00:00) =====
Matthew Wells: Hello, and welcome to Ceridian's third quarter 2022 Earnings Conference call, I'm. Matt Wells, Senior Director of Investor Relations, and on the call today. We have our Co-CEOs, David Ossip and Leagh Turner and our CFO Noemie Heuland. [Operator Instructions] 
 Before I hand the call over to David. I want to remind everyone that our commentary may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause Ceridian's results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as the cautionary statements in our filings. 
 Additionally, over the course of this call, we will reference non-GAAP measures to describe our performance. Please review our earnings press release and filings with the SEC for our rationale behind the use of non-GAAP measures and for a full reconciliation of these GAAP to non-GAAP metrics. Both our earnings press release and SEC filings are available on the Ceridian Investor Relations website. As a final note, A replay of this call will also be available on our Investor Relations website.
 And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to David. 
David Ossip: Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our Q3 earnings Today, I'll speak about our very strong performance in the quarter and continued company momentum as well as some exciting product highlights as we prepare for our global customer conference insights taking place next week. Leagh will elaborate on both our market momentum and our continued ability to scale. And then now Noemie will provide commentary on the Q3 results and full year guidance before we open the call for questions.
 Let me start with our financial performance. We had a very strong third quarter. We exceeded the high end of our guidance across all metrics despite the headwind of a stronger U.S. dollar. Our PEPM revenue growth remains strong and float income continues to benefit from a return to a more normalized interest rate environment. On a constant currency basis, Dayforce recurring revenue grew 32% and 27% excluding float. 
 Our business continues to scale very well. I'm pleased to report that adjusted EBITDA was $63.5 million, a 61% improvement year-on-year, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.1% of revenue and expansion versus a year ago when the business was operating at 15.3%. Adjusted cloud recurring gross margins of 74.8%, expanded 50 basis points year-over-year. We continue to invest in sales and product innovation to fuel durable revenue growth while also demonstrating our ability to scale operations.
 Third quarter operating cash flows were $52.1 million in the third quarter, doubling from last year and driven by operating margin expansion and great benefits. Our brand promise has always been to make work life better. The reality of the post-pandemic world is the way people work has permanently changed. And as a result, the demand for Dayforce remains robust. Furthermore, in a difficult market, every organization worldwide is focused on efficient growth and the most significant asset companies have is its people. Dayforce has always promised the delivery of quantifiable value, meaning real money saving and ROI back to our customers.
 We are the engine that helps companies determine the most efficient high-value way of engaging employees across the enterprise while also providing real-time insights and reported. This delivers quantifiable value for the organization. Given the new reality of work and the fact that every organization is striving to operate efficiently in today's market conditions, it's clear why demand for Dayforce is growing. Year-to-date sales are up significantly, and our pipeline remains strong, all of which I will ask Leagh discuss in more detail in a moment.
 Turning to technology and product innovation. We are very pleased to report that for the third year in a row. We have been named a leader by Gartner in its Magic Quadrant for Cloud HCM Suites for organizations that have more than 1,000 employees. It's worth noting that we are the only pure-play HCM vendor in a leader quadrant alongside the ERP vendors. We have continually said, our ability to innovate at pace and scale were resulting us separating ourselves from our competition. We believe that been clearly validated and at a point in time when demand for what we do remains strong. A consistent pace of innovation allows us to expand our addressable market across all segments and geographies simultaneously, whether it's serving the world's largest global multinational, delivering full suite capabilities in our native markets or breaking centuries old models around how and when people get paid.
 So far in 2022, we've delivered more than 840 new features to our customers and we're not done. In the quarter, we delivered the following technology that makes work life better for our customers. HR knowledge management, which provides HR professionals with the ability to create knowledge bases that empower employees to find answers to their common HR and compliance questions proactively. HR Knowledge Management is delivered seamlessly to employees through our engaging employee experience hub. 
 Mobile Timesheet Management that provides managers with a fast and efficient way to view and edit and manage time information for their teams directly on their mobile devices and Integration Studio which provides self-service enterprise integration capabilities, enabling customers to build, deploy and manage the integration for Dayforce. 
 Integration Studio automates many of the traditional manual integration reporting tasks that companies wrestle with and in doing so makes our customers more efficient. Further, it's the strength of our highly differentiated technology a single solution and continuous calculation engine that allows us to deliver innovation like Dayforce Wallet where we continue to see incredible market momentum.
 Today, more than 1,340 customers have signed for the Dayforce Wallet and over 750 are live. Average registrations continue to trend at 45% of eligible users and the typical wallet user uses the wallet about 25x per month. These trends illustrate what our customers are telling us, which is that Dayforce Wallet is modern payroll. It's increasingly becoming an expectation from employees across organizations of all sizes and industries.
 Recall, Dayforce Wallet is differentiated in that it allows employees to get paid when they want in real time with no additional cost to the employee or the employer, thereby improving employees' financial wellness by avoiding costly alternatives and while significantly reducing employee turnover and cost for our customers. All of this and more will be on full display at our annual customer conference held live for the first time in 3 years, starting next week, November 7 to 10 in Las Vegas. Reflective of our market demand, we have a high number of attendees across both customers and prospective customers, and we look forward to introducing you to what I believe will be another paradigm breaking innovation.
 Before passing it over to Leagh to give you more details on our results, let me conclude by saying I'm very pleased to see us continuing to execute on all of our growth initiatives and making meaningful progress on our path to 30% adjusted EBITDA and operating cash flow generation. We have a long committed to being the market-leading global HCM company and this quarter is continued proof of that. 
 Leagh, I'll turn it over to you. 
Leagh Turner: Thank you, David. As David noted, we're continuing to execute on our growth levers, while at the same time demonstrating our ability to drive scale. In Q3, we saw continued momentum across all segments of our business from emerging to large enterprise and in every region in which we operate.
 Year-to-date sales are up significantly year-on-year. This is driven primarily by net new customer wins and after 2 years of significant investment in the strength of our sales engine, we continue to see sellers productivity increase. For the 9-month period or year-to-date, deals above $1 million are up over 50% year-over-year, which is indicative of both our move up market and also the breadth and relevance of our offering in the mid market. Global traction continues with a stellar sales performance from our EMEA region in the third quarter, we're in -- we have strong momentum in the mid-market that's becoming consistently augmented by large global transactions with notable large enterprise EMEA-based customers.
 Our fourth quarter pipeline is strong, and while our teams are focused on delivering in Q4, they are simultaneously building pipeline on the back of very strong market demand. I'd also like to note that amongst our customer base, 38% now take Dayforce suite, and we maintain a healthy back-to-the-base sales motion, which represents approximately 25% of year-to-date sales. 
 The customer wins listed in our earnings release illustrate the strong demand for Dayforce. As we've said all along, our platform scales and this is evidenced by several very large global customers selecting Dayforce as their platform of choice over the course of the last quarter.
 As already reported, one of the world's largest shipping and logistics companies chose Ceridian to provide Dayforce Payroll and Dayforce Wallet to modernize its payroll processes and to offer unique recruitment and retention benefits. At seasonal peak, we will handle approximately 700,000 employees on our platform for this single customer, and we have shifted to the critical work of getting them live successfully. As well in Q3, a leading U.K. retailer chose Ceridian to provide its full suite of Dayforce capabilities, including managed services to support 50,000 employees across Europe and Asia Pacific. And the largest flat-rolled steel company in North America selected Ceridian to provide its 25,000 employees with payroll and workforce management in a complex and highly regulated environment. 
 In line with our growth lever strategy, we've delivered momentum in the global large enterprise while continuing to win in the mid-market and in selling back to the base. A U.S. financial services company with 8,000 employees globally chose to expand its Dayforce use to include payroll with workforce management already in place, the company was focused on streamlining its payroll processes with the help of Dayforce. The key differentiator in this win with Ceridian's modern technology that provides continuous calculation and the ability to increase payroll accuracy and efficiency. A global leader in packaging machinery manufacturing chose Dayforce as its unified human capital management solution with 5,000 employees in 27 countries, the company was looking for a single system to replace multiple platforms. With pay, time and HR in the single global Dayforce platform, the company will have better visibility into its data and can strengthen security and compliance. 
 In addition to great sales momentum, we're now operating at 74.8% adjusted cloud recurring gross margin and have a clear path to greater efficiencies ahead as we continue to leverage our global footprint, international shared services centers and as we scale our platform. All of this operational scale is being driven while we continue to improve the core service metrics, our customers have come to expect from us. Customer retention rates remain best-in-class. Customer SAT scores, which we monitor daily continue to exceed expectations. Support tickets, which are a proxy for both customer and product efficiency continue to trend downward despite us supporting a record number of customers. Our SI ecosystem essential to our ability to grow and scale is now comprised of more than 170 partners, many of which are priming our customers' implementations of Dayforce globally.
 And looking internally, we are so proud of the way that we are growing and developing our people to reflect the customers that we serve and to ensure the long-term health of the business. As examples, more than 50% of our employees globally are female, 50% of our VP level and above our female. As a result of these stats and many more, we were welcomed earlier this year on to the Bloomberg Equality Index, and we have completely eradicated pay disparity inside our 4 walls.
 By every measure, this is a very healthy business, prime for continued success. And before I pass it on to Noemie, I'd just simply like to thank our customers and partners who have registered for our Insights conference, starting next week. We deeply appreciate customers like Coca-Cola and Blackstone and Danone North America and Fourteen Foods and so many others, taking the stage to showcase how Dayforce has made their people's work lives better while delivering the value and return on investment that is just so critical during these uncertain times that we are all navigating together. 
 As I do each quarter, I would like to close with a broader thank you to our customers, to our shareholders and to our people. Thank you. Thank you for the faith that you have put in us while we make it our mission to deliver on that in the day-to-day and quarter after quarter and year-over-year. And with that, I'll simply turn it over to Noemie. 
Noemie Heuland: Thank you, Leagh. I'd like to provide additional color on our third quarter performance and full year guidance, which is detailed in the press release published on our Investor Relations website. As David highlighted, our third quarter performance exceeded guidance across all revenue and profitability metrics despite approximately 200 basis points of FX headwinds to growth. Notably, at constant currency, Dayforce recurring revenue, excluding float, grew 27%. Cloud revenue grew 28%, and total revenue grew 25%. 
 Adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.1%, exceeded our guidance range driven by revenue upside in the quarter as well as operational efficiencies and as illustrated by our adjusted cloud recurring gross margin of 74.8%, an expansion of 50 basis points. Third quarter operating cash flow of $52.1 million doubled versus last year, driven in part by operating margin expansion and float benefits.
 Turning to updated fiscal year 2022 guidance. I want to reiterate that our growth is impacted by additional FX headwinds driven by a stronger U.S. dollar compared to what we previously anticipated. However, on a constant currency basis, we are raising the midpoint and narrowing our full year guidance range across all revenue metrics. For the full year, we now expect Dayforce recurring revenue ex float growth of 27% to 27.5%, Cloud revenue growth of 26% and total revenue growth of 23% at constant currency.
 In reviewing Q4, I want to note that FX impact in the quarter is the greatest we've experienced year-to-date. On average, these FX headwinds impact our growth metrics by 300 to 400 basis points. Now the last point I want to make is we're raising our fiscal year 2022 adjusted EBITDA guidance to reflect revised float assumptions and flow-through of profitability upside in Q3, partially offset by increased sales and marketing spend in Q4, historically, our largest sales quarter.
 At the midpoint, full year adjusted EBITDA guidance margin of 19% represents a significant improvement year-over-year. As said before, we are committed to investing for future growth while continuing to drive scale and efficiencies across the organization.
 Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Matt to open it for Q&A. 
Matthew Wells: Our first question will come from Bryan Bergin of Cowen. 
Bryan Bergin: Wanted to just start at a high-level demand question. Can you just give us a sense, have you really seen any impact to pipeline or the pace of buyer decision-making? Just given the increasing macro uncertainty. And I'm just curious if you could talk about client segment size and by geography, it would be helpful. 
David Ossip: Alex, we haven't seen any impact as Leagh pointed out.-- Brian, we haven't seen any impact at all. And as Leagh pointed out, in Q3, we had very, very strong sales. Year-to-date, our sales are up significantly, the Q4 pipeline looks quite robust. Leagh, anything you would add? 
Leagh Turner: No. 
Bryan Bergin: Okay. That's great. And then a follow-up, just on the sales force. You talked a little bit about that. Can you dig in a little bit more on productivity levels, how you're feeling about sales force staffing here and just overall retention in the sales force? 
David Ossip: Retention has -- it's quite good. We're fully staffed. Sales productivity is up, as Leagh pointed out significantly over the last 2 years. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question comes from Mark Marcon from Baird. 
Mark Marcon: Congratulations on the strong sales results. Wondering -- can you talk a little bit about the guidance? You clearly ended up beating here by a fairly material amount in the third quarter. Appreciate the FX. In the commentary, you mentioned Bureau being down 13% to 14%. Can you talk a little bit about what some of the drivers are there and how we should think about it? 
David Ossip: Sure. On the Bureau side, if I look at the Ceridian payroll business, Bureau payroll business, which in Q3 was about $3 million, it drops down to about $2 million in Q4 that's largely just an end of life of one of our [ respected ] platforms. There was an accounting true-up on the Excelity side of about $1 million that benefited Q3. And so obviously, there's a drop going down into Q4. 
 The other line items are largely consistent quarter-over-quarter. So it's mostly those 2 items. One is the movement of end of life in an old Ceridian platform and a onetime true-up for Excelity. Noemie, maybe if you can add anything? 
Noemie Heuland: Maybe a couple of other things on the Q4 guidance for revenue specifically. We have -- now we're not expecting to grow 18% to 19% at constant currency. As you noted, there's a bit of FX headwinds on a GAAP basis of about $5.7 million versus our previous guidance. On Dayforce recurring ex float, we maintained our 23% to 24% guidance range at constant currency. So that hasn't really changed from last time we issued guidance. Remember, in the second half of 2021, we had some employment level recovery from COVID, which gave us a little bit of a boost. So the good compare on the second half is a difficult one, but we're maintaining our growth rates for Dayforce recurring at slow. We're expecting a bit of float upside as a result of the continued sustained interest rate environment, which we've reflected in our top line guidance. .
 And the other lines, David touched on them. The other thing I would say is Powerpay is still expected to decline single digit, but primarily due to FX headwinds. The core business on Powerpay is holding very well. We actually had a strong performance in Q3, and we'll continue to maintain that throughout the end of the year. 
Mark Marcon: Great. And just to be clear, with regards to Ascender and Excelity in terms of new sales and client retention, those continue to go well, correct? 
David Ossip: They do, and we actually are still selling a Ascender in market quite successfully. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question comes from Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho. 
Sitikantha Panigrahi: It's very impressive to see these large-sized deals like another 700,000 users deal. And in the last few quarters, you talked about 100,000, 50,000 users kind of deal. So what's really driving such demand lately? Is it something to do? Have you started seeing disruption by a legacy vendor? Or what's really driving such demand? And could you talk about pipeline of such large deals? 
David Ossip: Well, again, Siti, thanks for that. Remember, this has been a journey over the last 3, 4 years, starting with the restructuring of the sales force, building out quite an extensive part in network and obviously, proving to the market through successful deployments that the technology can scale to very large organizations. Our global footprint has also helped differentiate us relative to the other players inside the actual market. So I'd say the combination of those 4 things are coming together, and we're seeing continued traction quarter-over-quarter into the very large enterprise. 
Sitikantha Panigrahi: And then typically, December is year one of your big go-live month. How is the pipeline this year? How does it look like? And also, could you comment about some of these large deals you closed recently, when do you expect them to go live? 
David Ossip: Sure. Well, we have a -- the large accounting firm that actually will go live in quarter, I believe, which is actually quite successful. So a very quick deployment of probably it must be about 7 or 8 months or well over 50,000 people. And as you know, we've had quite a few of those going line about the same time period for that. We do expect a strong go-live quarter inside Q4. And from a sales perspective, it's also our largest quarter, and we're expecting another successful sales quarter as well. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question comes from Bhavin Shah of Deutsche Bank.
 We'll take our next question from Matthew Pfau of William Blair. 
Matthew Pfau: Wanted to ask on the EBITDA margin improvement. Maybe you can just discuss more specifically what operating efficiencies you're seeing? And then in the future, what operating efficiencies, do you see that are going to get you to the 30% EBITDA target -- EBITDA margin target that you mentioned? 
David Ossip: Sure. We're quite focused as you've heard us speak about this over the last number of quarters. Firstly, we're committed to taking the cloud recurring gross margin from the 74.8% where it is currently to 80% by 2026. The areas that it's coming from as Leagh pointed out, we've seen efficiencies on the customer support and on the operational side coming from having more robust software and better processes in place. She actually mentioned that the number of support calls coming in is actually at a record low. Even though we've had many more customers live, which is one example. We've obviously used a lot of automation and technology to get to that particular type of point. .
 On the actual sales and marketing side, P&T side, the goal [indiscernible] to hold them relatively flat as a percentage of revenue as we continue to expand. And a lot of the actual margin comes from 2 trends of recurring.
 The first is every year, as you know, the percentage of total revenue that comes from recurring revenue goes up by about 1%. And the second part that happens is the percentage of recurring revenue that come from Cloud versus the Bureau side. Recall that the Cloud has a 74.8% margin, and the Bureau currently has got a 61% margin. As that shifts more towards the Cloud recurring side, it lifts up the overall recurring margin of the actual business. By 2026, we expect that movement to be quite significant, and that drives quite a lot of the improvements. 
Matthew Wells: And our next question comes from Dan Jester of BMO. 
Daniel Jester: Maybe just to expand on that margin comment, David. Can you just -- it feels like a lot of that is organic, the natural evolution of the business. If we do see a slowdown next year? Are there levers you could pull to sort of accelerate that? Or is that sort of a linear progression as we get to 2026 on the margin opportunity? 
David Ossip: Our businesses are highly plannable business, as you can see by our guidance for the second half of the year as Noemie spoke about that when we expect about the Q2 results, we said we would grow, the Dayforce recurring by about 25% in the second half, and it remains the same. So we get tremendous visibility, which means we can also control the business quite well. And so if there is a slowdown, which, again, we don't see that in any of the trends in the market, in the pipeline, the buying decisions to go live, et cetera. But if it yes, we can obviously improve the profitability quicker. 
 And if you recall, if you go back to Q1, you saw us not being shy about making operational changes to drive efficiencies. And furthermore, if you go back to the acquisitions that we did in APJ in Asia, part of our thesis was that we could leverage the global footprint of those organizations to drive efficiency through our business. And we are doing that, whether it be on the product and technology side, the customer support side, the implementation side, finance, G&A, et cetera, we're taking advantage of the lower footprint -- cost footprint in those offices. 
Daniel Jester: Great. That's really helpful. And then just a follow-up on the Wallet. I appreciate providing the detail here about the pace of customer go lives -- it's -- if I look back over the past year, it's been somewhere between 100 to 135 a quarter. Are we now at a pretty stable pace for go lives? Or is there a possibility that we see Wallet further accelerate on a go-live basis from here? 
David Ossip: I think it's a constant stream. If I compare it, we've effectively got about 500, 600 accounts in backlog for go live. And so it's just a matter of activating those particular accounts. And then once we do that, there's a bit of a time when we go from taking them live until we get the registrations and the active card users for each of the different clients. When I look at it, we do probably around 700 to 800 registrations on an employee basis per day, and that has been somewhat constant over the last little while. 
Matthew Wells: We'll take our next question from Mark Murphy of JPMorgan. 
Mark Murphy: So David, in your script, you mentioned this focus on quantifiable value. And I'm interested in whether you think the value proposition of the Wallet it's actually going to resonate stronger if we do get into an economic slowdown, perhaps you'd have the typical business with more employees feeling a little strain and maybe wanting to access their pay sooner, maybe there'd be a little extra catalyst to keep moving that registration percentage higher? 
David Ossip: So Mark, a few things. Wallet today has become really the same as modern payroll that I don't think there's any organization out there that's looking for a modern payroll system that doesn't expect to have Wallet embedded in the solution. From a financial wellness perspective, it is definitely a huge benefit to people through the flexibility that the Wallet provides, especially that given that we do not charge the employees any fees to use the Wallet in North America that is paid through the interchange. The benefit that we've seen from a quantifiable value perspective for our customers is that the voluntary attrition rates have improved by more than 20% at those organizations that have rolled out the Wallet which is a tremendous savings to those organizations and cost between $5,000 to $10,000 to replace a person at a typical organization. 
 So a huge savings, if you can say, hundreds of not thousands of people leaving our organization. We're seeing very, very high attachment rates on to new payroll customers and I don't expect that to change. 
Mark Murphy: Okay. Great. And as a quick follow-up, again, I clearly understand you're not seeing -- it sounds like you're seeing health, which is impressive, and you're not seeing macro issues. But just to check on it, if the macro does end up manifesting amongst some of your customers at some point in this cycle, do you think they're going to be able to find the resources and the bandwidth to keep the Dayforce go-lives, kind of running on time. Because part of the reason I ask is that it sounds like they are. And I believe you have better capabilities than ever to be migrating the data and providing that deployment help and then providing all the support. So I'm just wondering if you think you're going to be actually in a better place there, for instance, then when the pandemic hit. 
David Ossip: From the onset of the Dayforce, the goal always has been to make every employees think like a CFO. So very much a strong, strong focus on return on investment to our customers. In an economy where people may be nervous or more focused on cost and efficiency. Our messaging really resonate nicely. Because as you know, we ranked #1 for payroll, #1 for client compliance by Gartner. We have I believe the fastest return on investment in market, which our customers have spoken about, I think Forrester and others have done case studies on that as well.
 So our messaging resonates very, very nicely. We've become quite efficient on the implementation side. Earlier [ day, I ] mentioned that one of the large accounting firms, probably the leader in the world when it comes to taxes and such, is going live, I believe, with the product in Q4, and that I believe was the Q1 sale.
 So you're talking about [ $100 ] a year in terms of go live and obviously, tremendous complexity around that. So I do believe that our customers will continue with the implementations will continue to take in life because of the savings that we're able to get from our system. And in addition, the compliance side does lower their liability and payroll and workforce compliance and HR compliant today are becoming more and more difficult. 
Noemie Heuland: The only other thing I would add is that we aren't constrained either. So we spent the last couple of years as you well know, building out an SI ecosystem. And so there are far more hands in the market to be able to bring our customers live. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question comes from Robert Simmons of D.A. Davidson. 
Robert Simmons: How much of a catalyst do you think that the inside conference coming back in person is going to be for you guys, not so much this year, obviously, but for next year? 
David Ossip: First, we're very excited with the Insights Conference. When we look at a number of prospective customers that are attending, the levels are very, very high. I would think that there's probably close to $100 million of recurring revenue in terms of opportunities across the prospective customers that are attending. And in addition, we expect very healthy attendance from our customers. The agenda looks fantastic. The customer speakers, I think, are wonderful as well. And as you know, we've always seen a high conversion rate of prospective customers to live customers. So it should be a very good conference. And hopefully, we'll see you there. Leagh, anything you want to add on that? 
Leagh Turner: I mean I think all I would say is it does 2 things. It accelerates deals in the current quarter, which is important, and it helps us build pipeline for the future year, which is also important. So what we accomplished in 3 or 4 days is really meaningful to the next year and to the success of closing out this one. 
Robert Simmons: Got it. That makes sense. And then I guess just kind of the competitive landscape, are you seeing anything you call out from the [ company ] that's different in terms of pricing, marketing, sales approach, product. Anything about that? 
Leagh Turner: I mean, Dave is looking at me. I would not say that there's a demonstrable difference the competitive landscape. What I would say is we were very pleasantly surprised by the Gartner Magic Quadrant and the fact that we are now alone as the single HR-only vendor in the leadership quadrant, which I think will make a demonstrable difference going forward with respect to the way that we compete. 
Matthew Wells: And our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh of Credit Suisse. 
Kevin McVeigh: Noemie, I think you'd referenced some incremental sales and marketing in the fourth quarter. Is there any way to quantify what that incremental investment was relative to initial expectations? 
Noemie Heuland: As you know, we're having -- we just talked about our Insights Conference that we're hosting next week. So that's definitely part of the investments we're making in Q4. We're also increasing, obviously, our travel capabilities for our sellers and implementation teams because we want them in the field talking to customers in the fourth quarter, which is our historically largest quarter. 
 So there's a little bit of incremental travel as well, which was expected and which we're supporting fully. So those are the main items. But the rest in terms of adjusted EBITDA guidance for the full year, we're flowing through the excess profitability from Q3 and the additional float upside, and we're continuing to make investments to fuel our largest sales quarter. 
Kevin McVeigh: Great. And then just a quick follow-up on that would be, what type of rate assumptions are assumed in the Q4? 
Noemie Heuland: Yes. We're assuming the current rate environment that you're referring specifically to the recent Fed rate hike that's actually embedded. But remember, because our portfolio is laddered and we have half of it invested in core, the effect will be throughout 2023 and beyond. And so that's -- the float guidance embeds the current rate environment and continued ladder of our portfolio. 
David Ossip: [indiscernible] answer the question, we ended off Q3 with the float balance of -- sorry, of a rate of 2.19%, and we would expect it to be about 2.7% in the fourth quarter. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question comes from Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo.
 Our next question comes from Alex Zukin of Wolfe. 
Aleksandr Zukin: Guys, can you hear me? 
Matthew Wells: Yes, we can hear you. 
Aleksandr Zukin: Perfect. I guess maybe just 2 or 3 for me. First, I wanted -- there was a deal that you mentioned -- that you talked about in the press release, the diversified metal solutions provider that you guys was 11,000 employees, 40 unique operating companies with multiple products. And that was led by an SI partner. I guess could you talk a little bit more about that deal? What was unique about it? What was interesting, was this a global SI or a strategic partner. 
 And the reason I ask about that is, again, it seems like a highly complex deal, not just a single module for a big company, but really an entire suite. And so I wanted to just understand a little bit of is that, do you have more of those in the pipeline? And I've got a quick follow-up. 
Noemie Heuland: Yes, it's a great question. Why don't I grab it and just say, you're right. First of all, I think it was 12,000 employees. I believe there were 315 locations, 12 countries. We replaced 35 separate disparate solutions across to your point, 50 unique operating companies. And yes, it was a full suite, and it was deployed by a partner. 
 And you asked I think the subtext is, are our partners capable of doing that? And the answer is, yes, they are. And the partner who did this deployment is actually a long-standing partner. They've been with us for some time. They would be on the further end of the learning curve. So this isn't a brand-new partner to our ecosystem, and they were able to bring that customer live successfully in record time. The question is, is there more of those out there? And the answer is yes, many. And you can imagine that it's our ambition, as you well know, over the course of the next couple of years to shift significantly in that direction. And so what we're doing in many cases, is we're solving in other partners into our projects in order to be able to learn and develop at rapid speed so that we can do even more of that over time. 
Aleksandr Zukin: Perfect. I guess, maybe also just a broader question. So maybe for David, I know we go back and forth on this. I wish we could get bookings from you guys, particularly when it sounds like they are very, very good. Absent that, is there a way to kind of qualify what you're now -- what you saw in Q3, the incremental opportunity that you see in Q4? And more specifically, again, you're putting up really strong bookings performance in the backdrop of a very, let's call it, scary macroeconomic environment. You're not seeing demand cycles lengthen or anything yet. I want to understand why? And more specifically, you've been through these types of economic cycles before in various companies. 
 Are you just going to see it later? Is there something that is making this space more resilient given the backdrop of coming out of COVID and these deals getting delayed. How do you see this playing out, not just this quarter but over the course of the next year? 
David Ossip: So that's a few things. First pandemic world is much more global than it was beforehand. The work from here is now quickly becoming work from anywhere. And so we're finding the requirement for global capabilities to be greater than before. And there isn't anyone else really in market that has a single system where you can handle the construct of a global employee record with native payroll capability native workforce management capability built into the actual product. And so that's driving a lot of the decisions that we see on the enterprise side where customers are coming to us because I don't think there are other really viable solutions in market.
 In the majors market, which goes for us up to 3,500 employees and even the enterprise space, which goes up to 10,000 employees. There is a significant cost savings when you move to a single application because you don't have to pay for the database, the infrastructure, the employee record across each of the different modules that all come together. So there's tremendous efficiencies just from a subscription payment perspective. And then from an operation of the system, it's obviously much more efficient and much more natural for people to use it. And I think that's driving a lot of the decisions inside the market. 
 And then finally, we always have been the strongest in compliance. And in many cases, customers come to us because they've had issues with other vendors in the space about paying people accurately. And we obviously do that very well. In fact, that inside is one of the features that Joe's going to show is now an add-on to the employee hardware there is a compliance dashboard, that provides information by jurisdiction about what the changes are in terms of compliance and payments requirements and such. So I think that's a very big part of it. 
Matthew Wells: And we'll take our next question from Samad Samana from Jefferies. 
Jordan Boretz: Sorry about that. This is Jordan Boretz on for Samad. David, Noemie, Leagh, congrats on the strong results. So I wanted to maybe touch on the bookings mix. So Leagh, you noted that in the prepared remarks. The number of greater than $1 million deals are up 50%, and obviously, that's extremely impressive. So could you maybe give us some color on how the bookings mix by customer segments or maybe mid-market versus enterprise trended this quarter versus the prior quarter? 
Leagh Turner: Sure. I mean maybe what I'll say, just to pick up the point that you put down is that it is true that a number of million dollar deals are up 50% this year. I would just underscore that those are deals in the upmarket, so let's call it, enterprise and large enterprise. But we're also seeing a significant number of $1 million-plus PEPM deals in the mid-market as customers buy a full suite. So I just put a finer point on that. With respect to momentum, I would say, we are categorically seeing it everywhere. We're seeing it in our emerging market. We're seeing it in our mid-market, that's in North America, EMEA and APJ.
 We're seeing it in the enterprise, which to David's point, is between 3,500 and 10,000. And we're seeing it in the large enterprise, above 10,000. There is not 1 segment that we operate in, where we are seeing a slowdown or any degradation in our pipeline momentum. 
Jordan Boretz: Great. That's helpful color there. David, I want to ask you a quick question on M&A. So the last acquisition that you guys closed was out of HCM in December last year. And broadly tech valuations have come in quite a bit since then. So has there been any change in how you're thinking about M&A? And maybe for future M&A, are there any specific regions you're targeting more so than others globally? 
David Ossip: There's been no change. In terms of M&A strategy, obviously, I think there's still a bit of a lag between the expectations of privately held companies versus the public markets. And we don't have any burning buyers we have to jump on. So we're quite patient to wait and see what comes out. Areas that we always see or inquisitive would be around the DAC countries into the Nordics, where we have a bit of white space at the moment. We all, by the way, launching German payroll in 2023, and we have a huge backlog of customers for the German payroll, which is actually quite exciting. 
Jordan Boretz: Congrats on the strong quarter. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question comes from Steve Enders of Citi. 
Steven Enders: I want to ask some more on the channel initiative. I think you called out some good opportunities that you were brought in from channel partners. I guess how much is the channel at this point bringing you into opportunities versus more in a fulfillment engine for you? 
Leagh Turner: It's a great question. I would say, plus or minus 50% of our pipeline is influenced through partners, and that's partners all kinds, that's system integrators, that's brokers, but they're touching a lot of our pipeline now. And what we're seeing when they do that is that our win rates in that segment of the pipeline are increasing quite significantly because the pipeline is better qualified. 
Steven Enders: Okay. Got you. That's helpful. And then maybe just another quick question on the guide here. Just in terms of EBITDA and how you're thinking about float income kind of flowing in there. I think you mentioned in the past that we're kind of thinking about 50% of float up side, going to the bottom line. Is there any change in and how you're thinking about utilizing the float upside here? And then how you're kind of thinking about kind of further investments kind of beyond 4Q there as well. 
David Ossip: No, there's no change. we've been quite focused, as you know, on what -- when we look towards 2026, we see about $2 billion of top line, [ 8% ] recurring margins and about 30% EBITDA. We also believe that operating cash flow will be very close to the EBITDA numbers, adjusted EBITDA number as well. .
 Regarding float, we invest the float in a AAA-rated fund, which means that we are quite limited in the types of securities that we can invest in. It's largely government and AAA-rated corps and there are certain rules around the amount of levering that you can do as well. 
 We put about 50% of the balances into a liquidity portfolio. And there, we typically get the overnight. And the other 50% goes into a portfolio that we typically lever out about 2.5 years. And so it gives us -- this is a little bit of time before we get the full impact of the raise of the interest rates. But if they do come down, which I expect they will come down at some point, it takes longer for that to actually kind of wind down as well. The rates that we're in at the moment, I would call that more than normalized rate environment. quite similar to prior to 2008. So -- and it's always been part of the operating model, if you like, of our type of business. 
 In terms of investments, we continually invest heavily in product and technology. If you look at the year-over-year investment growth that we've made in products you can actually see what we're actually delivering from that investment as well. Sales and marketing, we continue to invest in sellers. Q4, we have the investment in our Insights Conference, which is probably about a $6 million investment in that particular event alone. But we're very mindful of making sure that we do get return on all the  investments. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. 
Raimo Lenschow: David, I wanted to go back to one of the earlier questions when people were questioning demand and why demand for HR. What are you seeing post pandemic? You mentioned compliance already, et cetera. But like talking to people in the market, other vendors as well. It does seem like HR got elevated as a pain point post the pandemic and hence, it feels like it's more strategic again. I don't know if you could see that as well as you comment on that one. 
David Ossip: So coming out of the pandemic, you had the increase in attrition rates across clients. So it became more important to have things like succession planning, our property outline and have proper strategies around that. There was more of a movement, as I mentioned, more global workforces. And so finding an HR system that could manage a global workforce and report on that. Analytics became very important. Because all of a sudden, you had to think about did you have enough people to handle the capacity that you were trying to put through your business? And without having metrics around your people, that's obviously very, very difficult to do. 
 So the movement to architectures lighthouse, where it's all 1 database that makes that type of analytics much easier. Compliance has become more difficult. It started during the actual pandemic where tax rules were changing almost weekly. And this continual focus on things like employee privacy, ways that kind of fairness rules for the employees, payment rules for employees, minimum wage rates for the employees. And you need a sophisticated system that can handle those types of requirements. -- yes, in a world of today where we are almost at full employment.  You have to make sure that you can get as much as possible from your people. You have to make sure that the experience that you have for those people is as best as possible, so that they want to stay and continue to build out their careers at your organization.
 And if you do have vacancies, you do have to have strategic talent acquisition systems that need to leverage AI and ML to make sure that you have the right candidate experience and that you are bringing on the right people. And when there is churn, you have to rely on learning management systems because you need to have embedded learning throughout the experience of the actual people. 
 So all of that, I think, has become very, very important. And probably the last piece I would add is that, as you know, workforces today are more distributed, there hasn't been a return back to the office. And I think the deal with kind of error is over and people aren't going to go back to cubes.  And so you do need to have HR systems that can really help with collaboration and idea sharing new ways of doing performance management in this new world of work. 
Leagh Turner: The only thing I'd add, if I could, to that very thorough answer, is that we used to manage people shoulder to shoulder inside an office. Given that people aren't returning to the office, organizations are relying on technology to support that work. And as a result, to your question, a direct answer is HR and HR technology has become significantly more strategic post pandemic. 
Raimo Lenschow: Congratulations. 
Matthew Wells: And that concludes our Q&A session for the evening. Thank you, everyone.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-08-03 17:00:00) =====
Erik Zimmer: Hello, and good evening. I would like to welcome everyone for the second quarter earnings call for Ceridian. I'm Erik Zimmer, Head of Corporate Development and Investor Relations. I am joined on the call today by our co-CEOs, David Ossip and Leagh Turner; our CFO, Noemie Heuland; and our Senior Director of Investor Relations, Matt Wells. 
 I will now turn it over to Matt, who will run through our legal disclaimers. 
Matthew Wells: Thanks, Erik. 
 [Operator Instructions]
 Before I hand the call over to David, I want to remind everyone that our commentary may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause Ceridian's results to differ materially from historical experience or expectations. A description of some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in addition to statements included in our current and periodic filings.  
 Additionally, over the course of this call, we will reference non-GAAP measures to describe our performance. Please review our earnings press release and filings with the SEC for a rationale behind the use of these non-GAAP measures and a full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP measures. As a final note, our earnings press release and other SEC filings are available on the Ceridian Investor Relations website.  
 With that, I'll turn the call over to David. 
David Ossip: Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our Q2 earnings call. Today, I'll speak briefly about our strong performance in the quarter, what we are seeing in the macro environment, and I'll highlight our technology differentiation. Leagh will then give more color on our sales momentum and outlook for the second half of the year, and she'll go into details on how we are driving efficiencies across the organization. And then Noemie will go into the numbers before we open up the call for questions.  
 Turning to performance. We had a very strong quarter, and in constant currency, we exceeded the high of our guide on all of our metrics. Dayforce recurring revenue ex float grew by 30%, and 31% including float. Adjusted EBITDA came in at $61.8 million or 20.5% of revenue versus a year ago when the business was operating at 15.9%. This is a significant improvement in profitability and in scale. A large part of our EBITDA beat came from the 230 basis point year-over-year increase in adjusted gross profit on Cloud recurring to 76.4%.  
 On the macro side, we have not seen any slowdown in sales or any slowdown in decision making. Year-to-date sales are up significantly year-over-year, and growth appears to be accelerating. We have seen continued momentum across all segments. Deals above $1 million are up 50% year-over-year. Mid-market sales are above plan. Add-on sales to the base continues to be a healthy 30%. The number of customers who have brought a suite is up to 36%. And global traction continues, with EMEA and APJ sales both up year-over-year by more than 50%. In other words, we are firing on all cylinders and are quite confident on the outlook for the second half of the year. 
 And turning to technology. We continue to build great tech that continually expands our addressable market by extending our platform with new modules, adding capabilities at scale for large enterprises and adding global HR, payroll and time features that service the needs of global organizations and those headquartered outside of North America. All of which deliver more value to our customers and drives recurring revenue, growth and profitability.  
 And as you know, we're differentiating the market through our Dayforce technology in a number of ways. First, we have a single solution with a single database that spans across HCM. This drives efficiencies and cost savings for our customers. Second, our continuous calculation engine also drives significant efficiencies and much better compliance for our customers. In fact, we are seeing payroll processing times drop from over 20 hours to less than 2 hours at our customers.
 And we are broadly recognized as a worldwide leader for payroll, workforce management and compliance. It is this continuous calculation engine that has allowed us to bring Dayforce Wallet to market. Dayforce Wallet allows employees to get paid when they want, improving their financial wellness by avoiding costly alternatives, while significantly reducing employee turnover and cost for our customers.  
 Today, more than 1,200 customers have signed for Dayforce Wallet, over 650 are live. Average registrations are above 40% of eligible users and the typical wallet user uses the wallet about 25 times per month. These trends illustrate what our customers are telling us, which is that Dayforce Wallet is a modern extension of a payroll process and is the best expectation of today's new employee.  
 Another advantage we have relative to the ERP is our payment and tax services capabilities. In fact, I would argue that selling payroll without tax and money movement is like selling a bus without wheels and an engine. And on the global front, our global capabilities for HR payroll time and talent allows customers to have a single system for their global operations, which is a significant competitive differentiator for Ceridian.
 And finally, our focus on driving returns for our customers has led to our success. Each time we build a module, we determine which KPI we can impact with that module. That measurement needs to be quantifiable and convertible into a money saving. This focus on ROI has led to powerful customer case studies and reinforces our value messaging, which resonates so well in today's macro environment, and our results standard as proof. 
 I'll now turn it to Leagh to go into more details on sales productivity and how we're driving efficiencies across our business. 
Leagh Turner: Thank you, David. As David noted, this is an organization that is firing on all cylinders and in many respects, is buoyed by a macro environment where our customers and prospects value productivity and profitability more than they have in some time. Our technology delivers hard dollar returns at a market-leading TCO and our sales reflect that. After 2 years of significant transformation in our sales and go-to-market organization, we are clearly seeing the fruits of our labor. 
 Sales productivity has returned to an all-time high after significant investments in getting the right people in the right roles in the right geographies with a market-leading value proposition. The result is that we are winning at an accelerated rate in our key markets. 
 In the North American, EMEA and APJ mid-market, as detailed in our shareholder letter, we are seeing tremendous momentum in full suite sales, now more than 36% of customers buying the Dayforce suite. Momentum in selling back to our base. Now more than 30% of our sales are back to our current customer base. And real speed to value realized by our own implementation organization and that of our now more than 30 SI partners worldwide.  
 The time we took to build a fully native, full suite offering, easily deployable in record time and high quality by a global network of partners tuned to service the mid-market is paying off in both accelerated growth and in profitability. 
 In the global enterprise and large enterprise space, a market where we have been investing for several years, we are again seeing the fruits of our labor. Our shareholder letter tells the story.  
 In the second quarter alone, customers in the 10,000 to 12,000 employee range, buying the full Dayforce suite are becoming commonplace. We have always said we are not limited by our technology, our platform scales. And we are now selling and taking large customers with hundreds of thousands of employees. One of the largest e-commerce logistics companies in the world chose to expand their relationship with Dayforce to support their more than 100,000 employees in the U.K. 
 One of the largest grocers in the world with 350,000 employees will leverage Dayforce to support their profitable growth. And in the first weeks of the second half, we cemented a relationship with a global customer who will move more than 700,000 of their global employees to Dayforce in a phased rollout. 
 In each one of these wins, we are replacing antiquated technology, disparate systems that are glued together with people and undue cost. And in so doing, we are driving real ROI at market-leading TCO for our customers in a market where that's more valued than it has ever been.  
 Finally, a word about scale. We have been relentlessly focused on driving scale for the last many years. Again, the results stand as proof. We are now operating at 74.6% adjusted Cloud recurring gross margin and a clear path to greater efficiencies ahead as we continue to leverage our global footprint. All of this, while improving the core metrics, which our customers have come to expect from us.  
 As an example, the retention rates remain best-in-class while we globalized our support organization and simultaneously reduced ticket volumes by 15% year-on-year. This is but an example of hundreds of initiatives we have in place to support our continued accelerated growth and profitability. And I would be completely remiss if I didn't stop to thank our own people and our customers who have put their trust in us when we told them that we could do what we are now in fact doing.  
 And with that, I'll turn it over to Noemie to take you through the numbers in more detail and to discuss guidance. Noemie? 
Noemie Heuland: Thank you, Leagh. I'd like to provide additional color on our second quarter performance and the guidance, which is detailed in the stockholder letter. 
 In reviewing our second quarter performance, I want to reiterate that growth across Dayforce recurring revenue, Cloud revenue and total revenue faced FX headwinds driven by a stronger U.S. dollar compared to what we expected. These headwinds amounted to approximately 200 basis points of growth in the quarter. 
 On a constant currency basis, Dayforce recurring revenue, excluding float, grew 30%; Cloud revenue grew 28%; and total revenue grew 23%. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.5% exceeded our guidance range driven by revenue upside in the quarter as well as operational efficiencies, as illustrated by our adjusted Cloud recurring gross margin of 76.4%, an expansion of 230 basis points.  
 Turning to third quarter and fiscal year 2022 guidance, I want to note that in the second half of the year, we faced FX headwinds of approximately 150 basis points to revenue growth. These FX headwinds are incremental to our previous assumptions and are detailed in our stockholder letter. Despite these FX headwinds, we are raising and narrowing the range for our fiscal year 2022 gross expectations both reported and at constant currency across Cloud revenue and total revenue on a healthy Q2 performance and increased float revenue.  
 For the full year 2022, we're adjusting our guidance for Dayforce recurring revenue ex float to reflect second half FX headwinds. Growth is now expected to be in the range of 25% to 27%. However, we maintain our prior constant currency guidance range of 26% to 28% growth. When attributing float revenue to Dayforce, expected growth is in the range of 27% to 29% and constant currency growth is in the range of 28% to 30% for the full year.  
 In addition, we are raising adjusting EBITDA to reflect our float revenue guidance and flow-through of half of the profitability upside for the second quarter. Our 2022 adjusted EBITDA guidance implies margin moderation in the second half of the year as we continue to invest across our growth initiatives. That said, at the midpoint, we now expect to achieve adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 18%, which is an increase of about 200 basis points versus our prior guidance, midpoint of 16%.  
 As we continue to manage through an evolving macro environment, we remain committed to investing for future growth while continuing to drive scale and efficiencies across the organization.  
 Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Matt to open it for Q&A. 
Matthew Wells: Thank you, Noemie, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. I believe our first question is going to come from Willow Miller of William Blair. 
Willow Miller: Congrats on the quarter. So my first question is, what are you seeing in terms of employment within your customer base? Have your customers pulled back on headcount growth? 
David Ossip: I'll take that. Thanks for the question. We haven't seen a growth slowdown at our customers. If I look at my headcount reports, they continue to be about 4% up over the last 90 days, which would be in line with our expectations. 
Willow Miller: Great. And then just a quick follow-up. How does your pipeline look like now versus 90 days ago? 
David Ossip: As I said before, sales have done tremendously well year-to-date. As Leagh mentioned, we've had a very strong start to July. The pipeline looks very healthy. And we believe we have adequate coverage to have a good sales year. 
Matthew Wells: Next up, we have Mark Marcon from Baird. 
Mark Marcon: Everybody, it's Mark Marcon. My cousin, Emmanuel isn't on the line. With regards to the strong quarter, can you talk a little bit more about some of the big wins that you mentioned, Leagh? In particular, the large grocer who's being replaced there. And then you mentioned the large employer that's got 700,000 employees that you signed in the first couple of weeks. When would that start going live? And what were some of the key reasons why you were selected for some of those really big impressive wins? 
Leagh Turner: Yes. So first of all, I'll just take them head on. The large grocer headquartered actually in EMEA with 11,500 stores is going to leverage us for WFM event scheduling to expand the profitability of their operations, and they're going to operate in over 20 languages leveraging Dayforce. The global e-commerce and web services company that I referenced is going to use us for payroll in their U.K. operation for over 100,000 employees that actually builds on, which we're most proud of, a preexisting relationship. They're doubling down their relationship with Ceridian with opportunity, frankly, to continue to scale that relationship globally. And we replaced a major competitor -- a major payroll competitor. 
 And then with respect to the win in the first part of July, which you can imagine, dramatically affected our linearity for the second half. They intend -- we intend to provision their system within the next couple of weeks. And we're going to begin loading data into that system this quarter with the intention to begin a phased rollout in year. And we replaced an existing competitor. We competed with the masses in order to win and in fact did. And as I said, when we are completed there, we will have rolled out to 700,000 employees with the opportunity for expansion from payroll into full HCM over time. 
 So those are some patterns that we are seeing in the market. Our pipeline is full of opportunities like that. And what we're finding is that we're accelerating our ability to win them. 
Mark Marcon: Congratulations. That's terrific. And then Noemie or David, question with -- the gross margin improvement and the EBITDA margin improvement was really impressive. Nice to see that. Can you talk a little bit about some of the key drivers behind the improvement? And how should we think about those -- the Dayforce recurring gross margins on a go-forward basis as we start looking to next year and the year beyond? 
David Ossip: Yes. So I'll start that, and I'll let Noemie add some more color to the conversation. On the gross profit on recurring. A lot of it is driven by the efficiencies we're having across our support organization.  
 Earlier in the year, we moved to a model that allows users to support one another, and that has led to a reduction in support tickets year-over-year and has obviously increased the profitability of the recurring revenue. 
 The second piece is, as we've mentioned, as we extend the platform and we sell the add-on modules and 36% of clients today have a suite of modules they are using, we get additional revenue, but we don't really change the cost of hosting or the cost of support but that drives up the profitability of it as well. And then overall, just from a process perspective, more automation, [indiscernible] type of approach to the actual business has led to it. 
 On a longer-term basis, we're consistent with what we've said beforehand, we expect that gross profit number on recurring to go up to about 80% or so over the next about 3 years. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question comes from Jared Levine from Cowen. 
Jared Levine: In terms of the sales headcount, can you update us on those staffing levels, including those additional hirings that you're expecting within the enterprise segment? 
Leagh Turner: We're fully staffed in our sales organization at the moment, including the large enterprise segment. 
Jared Levine: Okay. Great. And then looking at your Dayforce recurring ex float constant currency guide for the year, can you help us in terms of the attribution across new logos, upsells, pricing increases and employment growth within the base? 
David Ossip: About 30% of it is sales to the base and largely the remainder of that would be new sales. So 70% new sales, 30% back to the base. 
Matthew Wells: And our next question comes from Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho. 
Sitikantha Panigrahi: David, I want to ask you your favorite topic, Dayforce Wallet. It's very impressive to see now 40% now registration rate. It looks like your employee -- the referral program working. So it's been now 2 years, how far you can go in terms of employee registration within the base? And how do you feel about the adoption at this point? And also, if you see any slowdown -- macro slowdown, how do you see the -- how the wallet with that? 
David Ossip: So on the macro side, again, we haven't seen any impact to the business. If I look at the number of uses of the wallet, if I look at the amount that people are spending per transaction, it hasn't changed. Over the course of the year, it has been largely constant.  
 In terms of registration rates, it seems to be going up by a few percentage points every quarter, and I think that trend will continue. We've seen a number of registrations per day go up quite significantly over the last 3 months. And so I'm confident that we'll see more people being live and more of their registered users. The play over there still largely is making -- is working with the customers, if you like, to increase the number of employees that are eligible for the wallet. 
Sitikantha Panigrahi: Okay. And then a follow-up to your one comment where you said how you differentiate your payroll and tax -- with your payroll and tax with ERP vendors. What sort of -- like how are you seeing the success in terms of competing in the enterprise segment, more selling HCM product in the enterprise segment? 
David Ossip: So I'm not sure if I heard the question correctly. But as I mentioned, the number of deals over $1 million is up 50% year-over-year. So we're having much more success in the large enterprise space. And in Leagh highlighting some of the wins of the very large customers, ERP vendors would have been at the table in all of those. Leagh, any other parts that you could answer? 
Leagh Turner: Yes, I'm just going to try and get to the root of your question, Siti, if I understood you correctly. Basically, what you're asking is, talk to me about your tax and money movement offering? And like does that really help you when you're selling full suite HCM? And the answer is, yes. And the reason that it helps is that in a down market, everybody is driving for consolidation. So lowest possible total cost of ownership. So if you can eliminate integration points or alternative providers or duplicative teams internal to your business, that's a win, which is why anything that we do that complements our full suite and allows us to be 1 single provider to our customer is part of the reason that we're winning full suite deals, payroll deals, in a down market. I would argue more than people who don't offer what we offer. 
Matthew Wells: And your next question comes from Dan Jester of BMO. 
Daniel Jester: Great. Maybe another one on the wallet. So if I heard correctly, you've got 1,200 signed customers now in the wallet. If I look at my math, it looks like it's about 100 new customers sequentially, and that's the lowest pace in a year. So I guess I'm just wondering, in terms of clients signing with Dayforce, how are you seeing the momentum there? And should we expect the pace of signings to pick up as we go into the back half of the year? 
David Ossip: Daniel, as I said before, the focus at the moment is working with the customers that have signed the 1,200 to first go live, 650 are live. So there is 550 more to take live, and then to work with those that are live to increase the populations that are eligible.  
 When we just look at the number of employees that we've signed across the 1,200, it's a considerable amount. And so we're focusing more now on activation to get the usages. You heard earlier, there was a reference to the referral program. We launched that last quarter, which effectively is -- in the first time, if you give your referral code to a buddy, the first time they use it, they get a bit of money, you get a bit of money. And we've seen an impact in terms of the registrations coming from that as well. 
 So our focus at the moment really is driving the eligible population mostly. But there's still a runway to go in terms of the number of customers we sign up. And we still are seeing above 80% attachment rate of wallet to payroll. And I know that Leagh would argue that, you know what the wallet has now become table stakes from a modern payroll system. Any employee out there today does expect to have the ability to get paid when they want to. And we're seeing that reflected in the RFIs, RFPs when people are asking about the features that they do expect to have in a modern payroll system. 
Daniel Jester: Okay. Great. And then maybe for Noemie, on the EBITDA margin guidance. If I caught what you said correctly, is that you didn't necessarily flow through all of the upside into the back half of the year. Are there specific investments that you'd call out that are keeping that from flowing through? Or are you just being conservative given kind of the world that could look a little bit more uncertain in the next 3 to 6 months. I'd love just a little bit more color on the margin outlook. 
Noemie Heuland: Of course. So as you saw, we raised both the low end and the high end by $20 million. So that's essentially all the float upside that we saw. We're flowing through the second half of the year, the full year guidance. And then we're flowing through half of the adjusted EBITDA beat from Q2, which is substantial. We continue to make investments in sales and marketing. We have our big event in November in sites in Vegas, where we have a lot of prospects and customers attending, and we continue invest in marketing and then in product innovation as we saw in the stockholder letter. So those are the main puts and takes of adjusted EBITDA for the remainder of the year. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question comes from Robert Simmons of D.A. Davidson. 
Robert Simmons: I was wondering on your international revenue. How much of it -- excluding things like Ascender, but how much is related to multinational is to kind of start off the view in the U.S. or their own Western market and then to international to other divisions versus companies that are native to those countries, taking you like in, say, Australia alone that sort of thing. 
David Ossip: So we're actually seeing success on both fronts. I mentioned this in my piece upfront that when we look at EMEA and APJ and that's where we sell to companies that are headquartered in either EMEA or headquartered in APJ. We've seen the sales figures go up 50% year-over-year. So we are being successful at selling in the local markets against the local competitors. As well, we are seeing additional rollouts of global employees from companies that are already live on Dayforce, which obviously will be companies that are headquartered in North America. The 1 logistics company that Leagh mentioned has been our customer in North America for a few years, and they have now extended their relationship to the U.K. population. So that's a perfect example. Leagh, anything you would add to that? 
Leagh Turner: No, I don't think so. I think you covered it. 
Robert Simmons: Awesome. Great. And then can you talk about what impact you're seeing from higher inflation rates or high inflation rates, I should say. I know that you passed on price increases generally at renewal. But how do new deals look? And then also, what are you seeing on the cost side of the equation? 
Noemie Heuland: Yes. On the price increase, as you know, we have a contract terms that allow us to increase upon renewal. We're obviously applying those and at the same time being mindful of the customer-specific situations. And we've also increased our price list to reflect the effect of inflation. But again, we're mindful and we're looking at competitive positioning of our offering in some deals, especially in the large enterprise sector. So I think we're mindful of applying price increases as well as looking at what others are doing and compete efficiently, especially in the large enterprise space. 
David Ossip: The one thing I would add is we're taking advantage of our global workforce to know the actual labor cost for us as well. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh of Credit Suisse. 
Kevin McVeigh: Great. Congratulations on the results. Is there any way to think about what the revenue opportunity is if the remaining clients were to adopt the full Dayforce suite. I think the number -- it's 36% today. But if that flows across the entire enterprise, how much revenue would be associated with that? 
David Ossip: That's actually a good question. So just a few parts of breaking that down. Even across the 36% that have a suite, there's still significant upsell capabilities across them. So at the moment today, I think we have 18 different modules that are available -- 24 modules that are available, sorry, excuse me. So there's a lot and every year, Joe adds on average about 2 to 3 new modules, which drive additional PEPM. So there's still a significant -- and I think there always will be a significant opportunity in terms of going back to the base. I don't have the math to work out the 30% compounded. I'll give it to Noemie to try to answer that one. 
Noemie Heuland: No, I think we -- David covered that there is significant upsell opportunity to the customers who already have the full suite by virtue of adding additional modules. And then if you look at the large enterprise wins that we're having today and that Leagh talked about, we're pretty much landing with payroll and time and workforce management for the most part. And the idea here is obviously once we land those customers, they go live on payroll, we expand with additional modules. So the opportunity is humongous. 
Leagh Turner: And the only thing I would add is that we're starting to see some of that. So you'll see in our shareholder letter that there's a long-term health care provider with 11,000 employees that bought the full suite from us. It's an example of consolidation and driving down TCO. They amalgamated a bunch of point solutions and went with our Dayforce. There's a global veterinary services company, 40,000 employees bought the full suite from us to manage complex scheduling requirements and to roll out frankly, Dayforce Wallet in order to be able to drive up employee retention. 
 And both of those, 11,000 and 40,000 employees, what it's been unheard of a couple of years ago that they would have thought more than pay and time from us. But now they're buying larger footprint, and they're a really good example of what Noemie said, which is we expect the customers that are in the 100,000, 350,000 and 700,000 range will buy more from us over time if we land with pay and time and service them well. 
Kevin McVeigh: Very helpful. And then just how long is the conversion on that 700,000 employee win? And what would that have taken 3 years ago? Because obviously, you've had an amazing amount of efficiencies from an implementation perspective. Is there any way to just think about the time factor on the conversion of a client of that size relative to maybe 3 years ago? 
Leagh Turner: What do you mean by conversion? What's your question specifically? 
Kevin McVeigh: When you're cutting over the actual HCM process from the legacy provider to Ceridian. 
Leagh Turner: Oh, I see. So your question is, how long will it take for us to get to 700,000 employees live on our platform? 
Kevin McVeigh: Yes. 
David Ossip: Look, it depends on the actual rollout of the client. We've seen big clients. Last year, we had a health care organization with 60,000 go live in 7.5 months. In terms of the U.K. logistics company with about 100,000, I would expect that to be about a year rollout to get them live. In terms of the other logistics company that we signed early this quarter, there's a bit of seasonality into that base as well. So we'll probably take up their base employee base, which I think is about 500,000 relatively quickly. It will peak up as opposed over the Christmas period to that 700,000 or 800,000 level. But I would expect that to be a one-tier project. 
Leagh Turner: The only thing I would like to augment that is that in the shareholder letter, this is an example of a holiday company based in United Kingdom, with 10,000 employees going live with WFM and a few other things, all within a 6-month period. They need to do it for business reasons, and we can accommodate that, whereas, again, a couple of years ago, that would not have been possible. 
 So just as an example of what David said, we've gotten much, much faster, getting customers live on time and on value and this 700,000 person customer. We'll do it at their own pace and what serves their own business, but we can accommodate their needs. 
Matthew Wells: And our next question comes from Mark Murphy of JPMorgan. 
Mark Murphy: I'll add my congrats. So you've mentioned a customer with 350,000 employees; you mentioned 1 with 100,000; 1 with 40,000; and now the 1 in July. Is it safe to assume that your win rates are improving? When we look at the upper market segment where they have these more complex international deployments, do you think that, that win rate is improving because you can handle some of that payroll natively? And then, I guess, with the expansion of the partner ecosystem to handle some of the deployments. Just trying to understand if it's a win rate or for some reason, they're just more of a cluster of these coming to market at once? 
David Ossip: So Mark, a few major themes in this. In 2018, when we spoke about enterprise, we already meant above 10,000 employees. Nowadays, when we speak about large enterprise, we're speaking about hundreds of thousands of employees. What's allowed us to do that is really 2 things. The first is that Joe with the product and technology team has significantly improved the scalability of the solution. From a payroll agent perspective, they've added the capability to horizontally scale into different containers that allow us to do these calculations very, very quickly. 
 A lot of that, we actually had to do to support the Dayforce Wallet, which as you can imagine, at any instance of the day, we're running a payroll for someone just based on consumer demand. So we've created tremendous more scalability.  
 Also on the product and technology side, we added some features that are required for the larger organizations to do payroll. So things like the global system of record, the ability to do a more complicated tax calculations are examples of that. 
 And then on the sales and marketing side, as you know, we rebuilt the sales organization about 18 months ago, when Rocky joined the organization. And we went to market and we brought in a lot of exceptional sellers who are familiar, sell into the large enterprise market. And remember, to sell into the large enterprise market, you have to sell value, you have to sell software, you have to get PEPM provisioning because you're a software provider, not a service provider. You have to know how to position value to the C suite and you have to be able to run through a more complex sales process. And I would argue that Rocky has done a tremendous job in changing the way we actually go to market that has allowed us to win those accounts. 
 So yes, I think we should be very proud of what we've accomplished in the large enterprise market, and I expect the momentum to continue. And I think we are beyond the tipping point of becoming the recognized leader for compliance for the very large enterprise. 
Leagh Turner: The only thing I would add is they just to hit your point on the head. There are more of these deals in our pipeline than there has ever been. Our win rates are increasing, and we believe that the competitive landscape is going to allow us to win at an increasing rate. And we have the most global solution on the market. 
Mark Murphy: Okay. That's extremely helpful. And just as a quick follow-up, you -- the shareholder letter mentioned significant traction in the month of July. And I think we understand now it includes a mega deal. Is it fair to assume it's also a healthy volume of business in your normal or traditional customer segments as well in the month of July? 
Leagh Turner: Yes. I'm just going to say, our mid-market business in all markets, not just North America, is on budget for the year, and that includes July. 
David Ossip: In fact, I would actually even add to that. If I look at the small business performance year-to-date as well for the half year, it's also above plan. So again, I think we're doing very well on a sales momentum basis. 
Matthew Wells: Your next question comes from Alex Zukin of Wolfe. 
Aleksandr Zukin: So I guess, clearly, I think you've talked about increasing momentum, which is obvious given the very large customer logos you're announcing which I think is more than -- at least I can remember you guys talking about on a single earnings call. So what I'm trying to reconcile is, given Leagh, you talked about accelerating momentum; David, you're talking about both businesses above plan. Just help us understand and bridge. If I look at the sequential dollar increase in Dayforce recurring revenue constant currency ex float, on a dollar basis, it's actually going up less than this time last year. 
 And in the context, I'm wondering, is there a linearity component here where some of these deals because they're larger, they're bigger logos, maybe they're more complex, there's a longer time a lag between the booking and the revenue recognition. But just help me understand that and then maybe couple that with why keeping the guide unchanged. 
David Ossip: Alex, it's largely the COVID sales basically moving through the income statement. And we spoke about that all the way down, I think, in Q3 and Q4 of last year that we had to just basically see the sales impact of COVID make the way through the income statement. We're going to see most of the impact in the middle to late part of this year. And then that's what you are seeing. But we now have seen a reacceleration of sales. 
Aleksandr Zukin: Okay. And I guess maybe just -- if I look at the -- is it a similar question around the go-lives or the net adds. I think it's less in Q2 than it was in the last 2 years in Q2. Is that again it's just larger customers, so less but larger deal values? 
David Ossip: It is up and down by quarter, as you know. You have to look at it more on the half year basis more than anything else. If you look at it, it was 175 last -- in Q1; 119 in Q2; 207 in Q4; about 63 in Q3 of last year. So it fluctuates quite a bit, and it always has fluctuated quite a bit. I would say if I look at it just on an absolute basis, 119 to 125 or 123 for the last 2 years, it's largely constant. And yes, we have gone up market. The average size of the deal is up about 10% year-over-year. 
Matthew Wells: And our next question comes from Bhavin Shah of Deutsche Bank. 
Bhavin Shah: Just following back up on upmarket. I know in the past you've talked about how important the asset partnerships will be for this segment of the market. How these relationships evolve relative to your expectations? And where are they in terms of adding to new deal wins as we think about this quarter and even going forward? 
Leagh Turner: I mean they're critically important. As I cited at the top, we now have more than 30 SI relationships globally. And by relationships, what I mean is we have contracted with the SI. The SI has trained their staff. They have people on a bench being utilized in deployments globally. And that is critically important to our ability to grow, I'll call it, exponentially rather than incrementally, both in the mid-market and in the large enterprise space globally. And it is also a key to our ability to perform like a software company with gross margins in excess of 80%, which is what we're tracking towards. 
Bhavin Shah: Super helpful. Just a quick follow-up on float revenue. I just want to clarify your commentary in your shareholder letter talking about the assumptions here. Taking into account the current rate environment, should we take that to imply that it assumes all rate increases thus far? And if we get anything additional in September or beyond, that could drive additional upside? 
Leagh Turner: Yes. The $13 million increase in our full year guidance reflects the most recent rate hikes. Remember, we also have a portfolio of investments that is laddered. So you have half of the portfolio that -- where that repricing immediately applies and half of the portfolio where you'll see that flow through a little bit later in time. But yes, potentially there's some additional rate hikes, you may see a little bit of upside there. 
Bhavin Shah: Great. I fully understand the dynamic, and that's helpful. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question comes from David Unger of Wells Fargo. 
David Unger: So it's great to hear the positive commentary on international sales and EMEA and APJ. Anything you can mention in terms of changes in pricing dynamics with those enterprise customers? 
Leagh Turner: I mean I'll start, and I'll ask David or Noemie to chime in. I guess state of the obvious, and I said it earlier. When you're servicing 100,000 employers, 700,000-employee customer for pay and time, you can imagine what our approach is, which is we see the customer and we go back and expand the PEPM over time. So that's our approach with these large customers, and it will continue to be as we continue to grow. David, would you add anything? 
David Ossip: No, I wouldn't be. I think that's good. 
David Unger: Okay. Great. And then great to see full suite sales 36% holding study. Any internal targets you could share with us over, let's say, the intermediate term? 
Leagh Turner: With respect to full suite sales, is that your question? 
David Unger: Yes. 
Leagh Turner: I mean I'll give you a general answer, and I'll ask Noemie and David, if they want to sharpen it. I guess my general answer would be, our goal is to sell full suite to the mid-market to go back and make sure that every single 1 of those customers owns the complete 24 SKUs that we have to offer to then plant seeds in the large enterprise, which is what we're doing and expand just as we will have in the mid-market there over time. That's our goal. David, would you add anything? 
David Ossip: No, I wouldn't. I would say we've always leveraged our leadership in compliance, which is payroll and time. We know that we can do that better than anyone else. And we know that if we win that and we get system of record, it is very likely that we will get the talent components as well.  
 Again, in 2018, that would have been true at the major -- in the mid-market. We now are also quite successful up to the enterprise space, which is about the 10,000 employee level. And on a longer-term basis, we would like to get system of record as well for the large enterprise, which we do believe will allow us to also win the talent components. And by the way, we have seen success even in large enterprise on suite sales. 
Leagh Turner: As I noted before, 40,000 of employee company, global veterinary services company bought our full suite just in this last quarter. So it's a really good example of what David just said. And the only other thing I would add to that is in a down macro environment, every customer is looking to rationalize total cost of ownership. So he who provides a suite wins. 
Matthew Wells: And our next question comes from Samad Samana from Jefferies. 
Samad Samana: Great. Maybe first one for you, Noemie. Just as I think about EBITDA, clearly, the company has done really well in getting the gross margins up and kind of keeping an eye on OpEx as well. So we're seeing that. I'm just curious, how should we think about adjusted EBITDA translating into free cash flow? Just how is that conversion. I know in the past, it hasn't converted quite a lot. Just should we start to see free cash flow inflect as well? Or how should we think about adjusted EBITDA converting into free cash flow? 
Noemie Heuland: Yes, absolutely. So if you just look at Q2, if you look at the operating cash flow, we grew by $5 million in Q2. So most of it is [indiscernible] ability. We had a bit of working capital movements in Q2 that we would expect to normalize over time. So the answer is, yes, as we expand on profitability, expand our plan recurring gross margin, getting more efficient on our G&A ratios and the like, you expect that to flow through the free cash flow as well. The other thing I would add is this quarter, similar to the previous quarter, we had severance payments as well as a result of our workforce action to move and leverage our APJ services center, and that will also normalize over time. 
Samad Samana: Great. And then, David, I know that the content, the pipeline sounded great. I guess I just wanted to maybe ask a follow-up. Is there -- in terms of the newer geographies that you guys are still ramping in and where you're -- where you have made it payroll. Are you seeing any changes in any particular geography or any particular geography shining that you could call out? 
David Ossip: There are three things. In EMEA, I believe the team has done a very good job over there, and they've got a very good partnership network, which I spoke about last time that are helping influence the actual deals and the win rates. 
 In APJ, we did a lot of restructuring of the go-to-market over the course of the last year, and we are beginning to see great benefits from that. As I mentioned, APJ sales, as is EMEA, by the way, are both up 50% year-over-year. So I'll say it's working very nicely. 
 We're also about to launch in Germany on the payroll side. And already, we've seen significant traction in terms of taking orders against the German payroll solution. So we're quite optimistic. And the 350,000 growth that Leagh spoke about is actually  based out of Germany. 
Matthew Wells: Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. 
Raimo Lenschow: David, can I stay on that subject? If you think about that, those kind of large customers are really a game changer and it doesn't happen very often that someone is breaking into the world of the SAP's, Oracle's Workplace there. Can you speak to who are you replacing there? And what's the situation in terms of setup? Was it a native software guy? Or was that a combination of someone doing payroll taxes somewhere else and then some software and you basically are coming in with 1 solution, 1 suite, as you said, and are able to kind of consolidate the solution there. Can you speak to that a little bit? And congrats from me as well. 
David Ossip: Yes. Raimo, as Leagh mentioned, the grocer is actually a workforce management client. The reality of it there is they were an existing client with a much smaller footprint, and they have now extended it globally. And I think there's actually still an upside over there of a few hundred thousand more employees that we expect to win over time as well. So it's just based on really performance of the Dayforce platform and the capabilities that we've built enable them to then run their business. 
 When we look at the other global deals, typically, there is a domestic provider. Sometimes it's a big ERP that we're coming in and actually replacing. Large enterprise is still largely vessel breed. So we get our foot in, if you like, with the compliance modules, and then we expect over time to get the system of record followed by the talent. We've had some success with customers like Costa, which is part of Coke, where we are the system of record. We've rolled out full talent capabilities to them, and that's obviously resonating very nicely in market. 
Matthew Wells: And we have, I believe, our final question of the evening from Scott Berg with Needham. 
Scott Berg: Congrats on the really good bookings. I guess I have 2 quick ones. Follow-up on the gross margin impact from someone's earlier question. In the response for the improvement in the quarter, I didn't hear about the impact of the improved float revenues. Dayforce float revenues were up $3 million sequentially from Q1. So I assume that also drove some of the benefit in the subscription gross margins or the recurring gross margins. But I guess, A, correct me if I'm wrong. And then B, can you talk to that impact. 
Leagh Turner: Absolutely. But ex float, we're also seeing a pretty significant bump in our Cloud recurring gross margin as well. But yes. 
Matthew Wells: Sorry, Scott, you had another question. Are you still there? Okay. Everyone, thank you for joining our second quarter conference call. We look forward to connecting with you over the following weeks.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-05-04 17:00:00) =====
Matthew Wells: Good evening, everyone. My name is Matt Wells and I'm the Senior Director of Investor Relations at Ceridian. I would like to welcome everyone to the Ceridian First Quarter 2020 Conference Call. 
 [Operator Instructions] 
 As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Joining me on the call today, we have Co-CEOs, David Ossip and Leagh Turner; CFO, Noemie Heuland; and EVP of CorpDev and Investor Relations, Eric Zimmer. 
 Before I hand the call over to David, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks may include forward-looking statements and projections. These forward-looking statements are based on management's reasonable assumptions and current beliefs. There are a number of factors that could cause Ceridian's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release and shareholder letter we issued earlier this afternoon on our website and in our SEC filings. Ceridian undertakes no obligation to revise any forward-looking statements made on this call, except as required by law. 
  With that, I'll turn the call over to David. 
David Ossip: Thanks, Matt, and good evening, everyone. Thank you for joining in the call today. Before we go into Q&A, I want to spend a few minutes highlighting the quarter. We had a strong start to the year, executing well across sales, implementation, customer support and product, and technology. Dayforce recurring revenue, excluding float, grew by 31% year-over-year, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Total revenue grew by 25.1%, and adjusted gross margin on recurring increased by 220 basis points to 75.5%. Adjusted EBITDA margin exceeded the high end of our guide by 347 basis points. 
 On the customer side, we added 175 customers and now have 5,609 customers live on Dayforce. At the same time, the average recurring revenue per Dayforce customer grew by 10%. And on new sales, we saw over 35% of customers acquiring a full suite. 
 Dayforce Wallet continues to do well. We now have sold over 1,100 customers on the Dayforce Wallet, of which 530 are live. Registration rates have increased to 36% across the eligible employees. Float balances also increased by 17% year-over-year. So overall, a very strong quarter. 
 On the macro environment, our business remains resilient, and we continue to benefit from healthy employee indicators and rising interest rates. And as such, we are raising our fiscal year 2022 guidance for revenue and profitability, as detailed in our shareholder letter. 
 With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Matt, who will guide us through the Q&A. 
Matthew Wells: [Operator Instructions] 
 First question from Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho. 
Sitikantha Panigrahi: Just wanted to dig into the Wallet. So it's almost like 2 years, maybe first year was the trying period, trial period and now full year. So it's good to see the momentum and even registration, 36%. Just wondering what's -- how is it trending compared to your expectation so far? And also, what sort of feedback you're getting on the new products like cash back and rewards you've introduced? And what should we expect in the remaining -- remainder of 2022? 
David Ossip: Siti, to answer your question, it's tracking well against our expectations. Also of note is that 89% of our new U.S. customers are attaching Wallet, which is obviously an increase that we've seen year-over-year. We've seen good reception from the cash back partnership that we have with DOSH. Also within the quarter, we added support for minor employees, which allows us, obviously, to deliver the solution better to hospitality and retail. 
Sitikantha Panigrahi: Okay. And just a quick follow-up to EBITDA margin, seems to be pretty good this quarter. Is there any kind of onetime thing? Or how should we think about the remainder of the quarter given how some of your realigning workforces? 
David Ossip: No. Siti, I'll start by just saying that we've raised guidance for the year. We've raised both the low end and the top end by $10 million. I'll ask Noemie to add a bit more color to that. 
Noemie Heuland: Yes, sure. So for Q1, Siti, we had a couple of things. We've increased our cloud recurring gross margin that actually exceeded our expectations. Last quarter, as you remember, we've discussed that we took some actions to rebalance some of our workforce into our shared services center in APJ. We've executed that very well. We've gained efficiencies on cloud recurring gross margin, and that will continue throughout the year. That's very important because that also helps us scale in the long term. 
 We had also taken a little bit of an upside on Bureau. We had a better volume than expected in our tax and payroll in North America. So that flew also directly to the bottom line. And we had a little bit of float upside as well. So those are the main things that happened in Q1. 
 Of note, we also continue to make some investments in our product and technology as well in Q1, and we'll continue to do so in the second half of the year in Q2 as well. 
Matthew Wells: Next up, we have Jared Levine from Cowen. 
Jared Levine: Can you discuss how 1Q bookings performance came in versus your internal expectations, including contributions by employer size segment and geography as well? 
David Ossip: Leagh, do you want to take that one? 
Leagh Turner: Sure. I mean, here's what I'll say. Q1 was an excellent bookings quarter, really solid result, and really robust customer demand. Solid growth in the North American mid-market, an excellent quarter in EMEA and a really good out-of-the-gate performance in APJ. As David said, more than 35% of our sales in the first quarter were full suite. And we are seeing continued innovation on the platform and therefore, ability to go back into the base and continue to sell. And we're seeing that our retention rates and Net Promoter Scores remain very, very high, which makes for a very warm base to be able to sell back into. 
 The pipeline for the full year, rolling 2 quarter and rolling 4 quarter, is very strong, and our win rates have gone up pretty demonstrably year-over-year as a result of a number of things, one of which is our consistently building SI ecosystem and the referred pipeline that we're seeing from that ecosystem, which is well known by the SIs and, therefore, drives greater win rate. So a really solid bookings quarter overall. 
Jared Levine: Okay. Great. And then in terms of sales force productivity, is that trending higher? So is it basically improving sales force productivity as well as a healthy demand environment? It sounds like kind of no impact from any macro concerns, whether that be Russia, Ukraine or inflation, but just be great to hear your color there. 
David Ossip: None at all. The sales force executed well across geo and across the segment. 
Matthew Wells: Next up, we have Matthew Pfau from William Blair. 
Matthew Pfau: Great. Nice results, guys. I wanted to ask on the full suite attach that you're seeing. How does that 35% compare to what you've seen historically? And are there any major differences in attach by client size? 
David Ossip: We've seen the attach rate go up quarter-over-quarter for quite some time now. So it's significantly higher than where it was, say, a year ago or 2 years ago. And we will continue to see that do well. We're doing particularly well in our majors market, which goes up to about 3,500 employees. And I would say, when I look at us competitively now on the talent side, we are very strong relative to both the ERPs and more of the pure-play players. 
Matthew Pfau: Got it. And so a follow-up on the talent intelligence suite and some of the functionality you released, is that a major discussion point in some of the full service wins that you're seeing there? And is that a big differentiation point relative to some of your competition? 
David Ossip: Again, as you know, we differentiate by having a single database, a single application, one user experience within the system. And so when we actually compete, we are differentiated, I think, from all in terms of our end-to-end capability across core HR, talent and payroll. 
Matthew Wells: Next up, we have Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. 
Kevin McVeigh: Sorry about that. Congratulations on the results. Can you give us a sense of where you beat expectations in the cloud recurring gross margin in the first quarter and really nice leverage coming through the model for the full year, but just relative to expectations in the first quarter? 
David Ossip: Yes. Look, we performed very well. What we're finding is that the robustness of the technology, which is reflected in the very high customer retention rate as well as our Net Promoter Scores, has led to a decrease in inbound core volumes and so lower costs. We're also seeing more efficiencies across implementation and obviously, the parts of hosting and customer support. 
Leagh Turner: The only other thing I would add is we've spent the last 8 years building customer communities where customers can self-solve issues that may come in -- may have previously come into our support center. And so as a result, we have a really sustainable way of solving customer needs that's been built by a really good team. 
Kevin McVeigh: Great. And then just a quick follow-up. Of the 1,100 customers that are signed on the Dayforce Wallet, I think in the shareholder letter, you said 530 were live. The incremental 570, how should we think about the sequencing of that in terms of them going live? 
David Ossip: It's -- there's very real magic to the sequencing of the actual customers. As you know, we typically try to take our payroll customers live on a quarter end in the U.S. And in Canada, it will be more monthly or will be more monthly in EMEA and APJ. When it comes to Wallet, it really comes down to how quickly the customers want to move. Most customers start off with a smaller group of employees, which they tested out, roll it out and once they get comfortable they then extend it to the full population. 
Matthew Wells: Next up, we have Mark Marcon from Baird. 
Mark Marcon: Congratulations on the quarter. Wanted to delve more deeply in terms of the bookings that you highlighted in the shareholder letter. I was particularly impressed by the government of Canada. It looks like that is progressing well. Wondering if you can give some color there as well with regards to the magnitude of the international wins that you're getting. It looks like you're making really nice progress from that perspective. Wondering if you can comment about what the competitive environment is like there? Who the takeaways are from? And what the scope of the services are that the international clients are taking on? And then I've got a follow-up. 
David Ossip: I'll start directionally, and I'm sure Leagh will add a lot more color. The government of Canada is a project appears to be progressing very well. The contract value was increased by CAD 21 million inside the quarter. So I think that's a good reflection of the progress that we're making over there. 
 On the global side, I think I'd be amissed if I didn't talk about the expansion we've had across native payroll. Within the quarter, we started releasing Singapore major payroll, which is now in a pilot with a few charter customers. And as well with Project Unify, which is the Excelity and the Ascender pay engines. We are now supporting countries in Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong. So we've made just tremendous progress on the global side. 
 Two data points on the global side. One, our products are very competitive to the players inside those geographies. So we are not only selling to North American companies that have populations in the EMEA, APJ, LatAm, Brazil and Caribbean marketplaces, but we actually compete head on with the local players. And because of the investments we have made in core HR and talent and workforce management, our product, obviously, is very, very competitive inside the market. 
 In terms of percentage of ACV, Global is now becoming quite considerable. I believe that the -- of the ACV numbers, the sales number within the quarter, about 20% of it was outside of North America. 
 Now Leagh, do you want to add any color to either global or to [ GOC ]? 
Leagh Turner: Yes, I think the only thing I would add is the way that we think about global is as we expand, there's an opportunity to do 2 things, Mark. We can sell locally. So to customers that only have an employee base in the locale that we're servicing, or we can sell to global multinationals with lots of different geographies. So our global expansion allows us to unlock TAM in both of those indices simultaneously. And you can see that in our shareholder letter. 
 So what I would say is in the shareholder letter, we call out the longest-standing retailer based in EMEA, with 10,000 employees, they bought the full suite. They're EMEA-based largely, and they're going to roll it out to their entire population. A global online gaming company in the U.K. with operations across 10 countries and 7,000 employees can also be serviced by us. When you shift to some of the larger references that we noticed -- that we noted, excuse me, in the shareholder letter, the second largest global consultancy in the world chose Ceridian to deploy to their North American population of 52,000, but with opportunity to expand globally. 
 And then as we referenced under our customer section, the world's largest leading global business information company chose us to service their North American population first, which went live in less than a year, and they're now rolling us out to 16 countries over the course of the next 14 months. So we have an opportunity to do those 2 things as we grow globally, which is a really important marker to our success. 
Mark Marcon: That's fantastic. And I had a question for Noemie. Can you talk a little bit about the impact in terms of rising rates? What did you already bake into the guidance? And what could potentially be a further addition as we think about the Fed's discussions this afternoon in terms of rolling out short-term rate hikes? 
Noemie Heuland: So we've raised our guidance, as you saw in cloud revenue and total revenue to account for the near-term rate environment. So we've accounted for the recent hikes that we saw, including today. And we also have to take into account our laddered portfolio. So remember, there's a -- we have half of our portfolio that's invested in liquidity and the other half is invested in longer-term instruments. So there's not -- there's a little bit more timing until all those interest rates benefit [ more floats ], but we reflected what we believe is still years of that interest rate environment. 
Matthew Wells: Next up, we Robert Simmons from D.A. Davidson. 
Robert Simmons: First, I was wondering what impact are you seeing from higher inflation rates? Are you able to pass some of that -- in terms of price increases to customers presumably at renewals? 
David Ossip: Yes. Majority of our contracts, we have CPI arises inside. So we benefit over time from an increased inflation. 
Robert Simmons: The sound quality is a little off. I think maybe there's something wrong with your microphone or speakers, something like that. I kind of half-hearing you at times. 
 But second question, the severance charges in the quarter were pretty high. I guess can you talk about kind of what kind of changes you're making? And do you think you've got things pretty much set at this point? 
Noemie Heuland: Yes. So let me take that, and maybe you can add some color. So first of all, as we've discussed before, now we expected we had rebalanced our workforce, especially in the support and operations into our shared services center in APJ. We've expanded our support center in Manila. We've done that quite successfully. We had very good hiring trends over there. So that has helped us be more efficient and gain scale in the cloud recurring gross margin, as we've mentioned. 
 We've also done typically what we do at the beginning of the year. We've also performance managed and look at our existing sales force as well as resources in the product technology group and looked at performance management typical -- as you would expect us to do every beginning of the year. So that's the other part of it. 
Matthew Wells: Next up, we have Pinjalim Bora from JPMorgan. 
Pinjalim Bora: Congrats on the quarter, I'm just sitting in for Mark here. David, I have a question on Wallet. How far along are you with respect to the original vision of the product? Because I remember it was a pretty grand vision with respect to the Dayforce identity where employees will be able to carry the Wallet across different organizations. Help us understand where are you in that journey? 
 And maybe just the unit economics that you're realizing on Wallet at this point. 
David Ossip: Yes. So we're very happy with the traction we're getting with Wallet and the Wallet capabilities. I also would say that the Wallet is a very robust system. In other words, we've moved a lot of money very reliably over the last about 18 months to 2 years. In terms of the full vision, we are actively now building that. And I would expect it to come to market late next year. 
Pinjalim Bora: Later this year? And we'd expect more revenue... 
Leagh Turner: Late next year, sorry. 
Pinjalim Bora: Late next year. Okay. Got it. And the second question about sales hiring. Help us understand where are you with respect to sales capacity for this year given the tighter labor market? 
Leagh Turner: I would say the sales organization is near capacity now. So we spent a huge amount of time in Q1 doing what every organization does in Q1, which is setting their go-to-market, making the changes that we believe were required in order to unlock the year. And we went on, not only -- to Noemie's point, we performance managed the sales team appropriately, which one should do every year in a healthy sales organization, and we hired the backfill appropriately and of higher quality, in our belief. And so as a result, have a really great go-to-market setup for the full year. 
Matthew Wells: Next up, we have Bhavin Shah, Deutsche Bank. Bhavin?
 Okay. We'll circle back. Next up, we have Dan Jester from BMO. 
Daniel Jester: Just conceptually, how should we be thinking about in a higher interest rate environment and how you fund the Wallet? And any sort of puts and takes we should be thinking about from that perspective? 
David Ossip: In terms of the actual Wallet, as the interest rates go up, the basis points do go up as well. But if you take it at a 25 basis points, that amounts to probably about, I don't know, 7 basis points, the amount of time that's outstanding. So if it goes up by 1% it would be 28 basis points type of thing. 
Daniel Jester: Okay. And then with regards to the international commentary, sounds very positive. I didn't catch how much of that was net new versus conversions from some of the acquisitions made over the years. Can you just dive into that, please? 
David Ossip: They were net new. 
Leagh Turner: Did you hear that? I don't know if we're a little choppy on this end. David said, they were all net new. 
Daniel Jester: Okay. Great. 
Matthew Wells: So next up, we have Josh Reilly from Needham. 
Joshua Reilly: Maybe one on the macro here. When you're looking at the business outside the United States, we know that the U.S. has been pretty resilient here since the Ukraine war started. But have you seen any divergence in customer confidence outside the U.S. since the war has started specifically? 
David Ossip: We have very little exposure to Russia and Ukraine. I was in London probably about 4 weeks ago, and I didn't see any impact from the war, as strange as that might be. So we continue to do very well in EMEA, and in the U.K. and Ireland. 
Joshua Reilly: Got it. That's helpful. And then you mentioned in the shareholder letter that the Dayforce card continues to be used in average of 23x per month by customers were relevant... 
David Ossip: 25x. 
Joshua Reilly: Oh, is it 25? Okay. Sorry, I thought that was 23. Curious, is the mix and/or size of these transactions changing now that the economy is reopening? 
David Ossip: No, I haven't looked at that in particular. It still seems to be the same largely grocery, fast food, restaurants, gas and convenience, followed by ATM withdrawals. The average withdrawal typically is about $30. 
Matthew Wells: Next up, we have Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. 
Raimo Lenschow: I'm going with the Black Tuesday as well. David, I wanted to ask about the Wallet in terms of it offering a differentiation factor for you in sales pitches. How is that playing out? And what do you also expect from the industry there in terms of trying to come up with copycat products to kind of say, oh, we have that as well. Can you speak to that, please? 
David Ossip: Yes. Look, Raimo, it's very strong. As I mentioned, in the U.S., we're seeing an 89% attachment rate for Wallet to new sales, which talks about, obviously, the perceived strength of the product and the value that it brings to the employees of our customers. We have seen the other players in markets bringing kind of bolted-on solutions into the marketplace. 
 The major difference is with us, there's no reconciliation that's required, and there is no loan made to the employee. So in all of the other solutions, the card vendor effectively gives a loan to the employee for the number of days outstanding. We don't do that. We do a true payroll where we do the remittances at the federal and the state level the very next day. So it's a truly compliant type of solution. 
 The other difference is we do not charge any direct fees to the employees of our customers. We don't believe in doing that. We think that would be morally wrong, whereas the other solutions do require membership fees or fees to use the actual Wallet. 
Raimo Lenschow: Okay. And then if I may, one follow-up. As you start winning more upmarket, you have bigger accounts. What do you see in terms of customer interest, customer appetite to kind of revisit their HR systems? Going back to that whole theme of back office and realizing like, oh, my front office systems look really good, but my back office is very dated. You have more success upmarket now. What do you see in terms of customer conversations there? And congrats from me as well. 
David Ossip: Raimo, I would start off by saying with the government of Canada, what we are piloting and testing is core HR, talent, payroll and workforce management. And as you know, if that goes forward, that's for well over 100,000 people. 
 In the major market in the enterprise space, we have a very, very healthy attachment rate and upsell rate to the customers where we do, do the core HR as well as the talent modules. In EMEA, we typically start off with core HR and talent because, as you know, those are more demanded than probably payroll in that particular market. And probably the same across APJ. 
 We now are getting traction in our Gartner positioning means that we are being considered for the back office pieces as you would say, the core HR, but as well as some of the talent components. 
Matthew Wells: [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions. Thank you all for joining us on the call, and we look forward to speaking with you in the future. 
David Ossip: Thank you, everyone. 
Leagh Turner: Thank you. 
Matthew Wells: Thank you.

 With that, I will turn the call over to David. 
David Ossip: Thank you, Erik, and welcome, everyone, to our Q3 earnings call. Let me say a few quick words about the quarter before we open it up for general Q&A. We had a very solid quarter with continued great execution across the entire business. Dayforce recurring revenue ex-float grew on a GAAP basis by 33% or on a constant currency basis by 31%. Total revenue increased on a GAAP basis by 26% or 24% on a constant currency basis. For the fiscal year of 2021, we slightly increased the guidance and we narrowed the range to $1.14 billion to $1.19 billion. On the gross cloud margin, we saw an improvement of the gross cloud margin to 72.7%, which is up to 90 basis points on a constant currency basis and up 70 basis points on a quarter-over-quarter basis.  
 Customer POP accounts increased by about 11% year-over-year, and the average size of the customers also increased about 11%, and on a 12-month basis, we have taken live about 523 customers. Float balances also increased by about 25%, but float income was negatively impacted by a slight decline in the yield by 36 basis points.  
 Adjusted EBITDA was 39.4%, which is up 20 basis points on an ex-float basis. On the Dayforce Wallet, we continue to see very strong metrics. The number of customers live on Dayforce Wallet is now above 290 customers. We have sold over 800 accounts at this point in time. We saw registration rates across the eligible employees who have access to the wallets grow to about 29%. And when we look at the top quartile of tenured customers, we see registration rates above 50%. Usage of the wallet continues to be very healthy with an average number of transactions of above 25 transactions per month.  
 In early October, we closed on an acquisition of Data Fusion, which further increases our compliance advantage and gives us specific capabilities for certified payroll reporting, prevailing wage rate calculations, incentive payments, union rate calculations and very complex general ledger reporting. This technology is immediately available and will be integrated into Dayforce. This acquisition will obviously help accelerate our growth in construction, government contracting, manufacturing, unionized environments, the public sector and not for profit.  
 Also in the first week of October, we held our first in-person customer event in over 2 years with the first stop of the Ceridian World Tour in Las Vegas. At the CWT event, we shared our vision for Dayforce to deliver the always on people platform for the global workforce, which is anchored by our brand promise of making work life better. A few highlights of the event. We had some product announcements, including the announcement of screaming pay, which is the automatic delivery of earnings and net earnings to our employees' Dayforce Wallets. We announced the HR service delivery, which is an end-to-end employee solution that provides an always on HR compliance support. And we also discussed Dayforce Talent Intelligence, a suite of new transformative talent management solutions empowered by AI and data.  
 We plan to build on the success with our next CWT Torstar in New York. This advantage is primarily focused on customers will also feature an investor track, including a session with the Ceridian executive team starting at 3:30 p.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, November 11, that portion will be webcast, so please join us. You can find the information on our investor website on how to register the event or join this session via live webcast.  
 I'm also very pleased to share that Ceridian was once again named a leader in the 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud Human Capital Management suites or enterprises above 1,000 employees. We believe this report further validates our vision, the innovation of the Dayforce product and our commitment to delivering quantifiable value for our customers.  
 Before I hand it back to Erik, I would like to close by saying how proud I am of our Ceridian team across the globe. Our engagement metrics are up. Our culture remains vibrant as we alongside our customers transition to a new hybrid work environment and our purpose and our brand promise to make work life better has never been more clear and relevant.  
 Erik, back to you. 
Erik Zimmer: Thanks, David. [Operator Instructions] 
Erik Zimmer: Today, the first question comes from the line of Alex Zukin of Wolfe. 
Aleksandr Zukin: And congrats Ceridian team on a solid quarter. I guess I wanted to start out, David, by asking the question of around the narrowing of the guidance range and particularly in the shareholder letter, you called out seeing some employment headwinds in your customer base of them not being able to hire at the pace or rehire at the pace that they wanted to. And it impacted the quarter. I'm assuming it impacted the guide somewhat. I wanted to ask a broader question, which is, how long do you anticipate this to be a headwind for the business? And are we -- if we step back and from a big picture perspective, look at the business, you're seeing clearly tailwinds around the war for talent and necessitating, a modernization initiative of many HR organizations and tools, but at the same time, you get paid per employee per month. And if you can't hire, then you can't pay Ceridian more. So work -- talk to us about those 2 dynamics, are they balancing out because new bookings are well ahead of where you thought you were going to be, and we can't see those numbers, we can only see the PEPM stuff, but that would be very helpful, I think? 
David Ossip: Sure. So Alex, great series of questions. So I'll try to break it down into different pieces. So for Q4, we had expected last time we spoke, a $1.5 million improvement in the headwind from employee accounts. As we pointed out in the shareholder leisure, we're seeing that it's taking slightly longer for our customers to fill their open job requisitions. So we have decreased what we expect the improvement of Dayforce to be down by about $0.5 million. And that is the tightness that we've actually taken. So we've widened the Q4 guidance by corresponding by that amount. However, we have taken the beat that we had in Q3 to the full year guidance, if you like. So that gave us the increase in the actual guidance. 
 In terms of the business, obviously, I do believe we have been executing tremendously well, that if I look at it from a pipeline perspective, it still remains very strong. And we are forecasting for the second half of the year, that sales will come in quite favorable to last year and to the year before that, which speaks obviously to the sales execution of the actual business. 
 On the implementation, projects continue to be implemented, a lot of activity with our customers. And I'm actually seeing some tremendous feedback from our customers in terms of the NPS or the customer satisfaction levels as well. In terms of the tightness of the, if you like, the hiring market, I wish I had a magic mirror or something. But at this point, just looking at what we know, given the employment numbers that we did see in September, which remember, do give us October. And what we believe we saw in October, which gives us visibility into November, and what we're currently seeing in November, which will give us visibility into December. We believe our guidance range is pretty good. 
Aleksandr Zukin: Got it. And I guess, is this -- should we start thinking as we model -- as we adjust our models for next year, should we start moderating our assumptions for an employee tailwind in general based on these early indications? And then maybe for Noemie, also walk us through some of the adjustments around the adjusted EBITDA guide? It implies that you are spending a little bit more, I'm assuming on marketing and sales, either hiring or activities. And then also, I apologize for the multiple questions, but we do track job postings and it did look like Ceridian's job postings declined quite a bit over the past couple of weeks, that could be great because you hit all of your hiring targets, but I just wanted to double check that? 
David Ossip: Yes. Just on the hiring side, we have been hiring very aggressively throughout the year. What I will say is that we haven't really been struggling in finding fantastic candidates across the organization. In terms of the adjusted EBITDA, I'll hand it over to Noemie for all the fun and goodness in that conversation. So Noemie, all over to you. 
Noemie Heuland: Yes. Sure. So our adjusted EBITDA for Q3, as you saw, was $39.4 million or 15% -- 15.3% of total revenue. For the full year, we continue to expect our adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 15.4% to 15.9% of total revenue. This is pretty consistent with what we've said before. We're continuing to invest in our product and technology. We saw we made some exciting product announcements recently. And your comment about hiring, we're actually very successful in attracting top talents in a tight labor market, which shows our brand is strong and our reputation is strong as well. 
 We've made some significant investments in our R&D, as you saw, our cash spend on R&D went up from less than 10% of our total revenue in Q3 last year to above 13.6% this quarter. We've ramped up our services delivery capacity, which is kind of the timing thing that you see from Q3 to Q4 where we are ramping up to service our customers to go live in Q4, which is our largest go-live quarter. There's a lot of very large customers going live in Q4. And we're also focused on integrating the Data Fusion technology into the Dayforce platform. 
 The other thing I would say is we've also reopened our offices throughout the summer in North America. We've returned to in-person meetings as well, which is very important for our people after having spent 2 years apart. And our sales reps are traveling to meet our customers and prospects throughout the fourth quarter. We've seen a lot of benefits, obviously, from digital selling, and we continue to invest in digital sales capability, that's not going to go away, that was a great learning from the pandemic times. But we also want our sales -- the sales and marketing team to be meeting customers and prospects on site, and we've done so quite successfully in Vegas as an example, and we continue to do that throughout Q4. So that explains a little bit the timing between Q3 and Q4. But overall, our full year adjusted EBITDA and guidance range hasn't changed and our investment priority remained consistent. 
Erik Zimmer: Up next, we've got Jared Levine from Cowen. 
Jared Levine: In terms of Dayforce sales force productivity, where do we stand versus pre-pandemic if below when do you expect a full recovery? And if we're above, what kind of -- what's driven that improvement? 
David Ossip: Sorry, Jared, you're talking about sales productivity prior to pre-COVID? 
Jared Levine: Yes. 
David Ossip: That's a difficult number to answer because I don't know if we've actually measured a pre-COVID, post-COVID. But what I would say is that we are quite pleased with our sales productivity numbers. And when I look towards next year, I think we would expect to get even more productivity out of the actual group. As you know, this year, we invested very heavily in building out the actual sales team. We did that for a number of reasons. One, obviously, to move into the enterprise space to build out muscle in working with the system integrator relationships we put in place and also to build out our capability is to focus on the full HCM platform, not only on the compliance modules. And I would say all of that has been going very well, not only in North America but on a global basis. Noemie, anything that you would add to that? 
Noemie Heuland: No, I think you covered it all. We've invested also in the sales support organization with value advisers, solution advisers and people who can sell alongside system integrators and upmarket with a large customer. So that -- but you covered most of the points, David. 
Jared Levine: Okay. Great. And then in terms of the pace of Dayforce go lives in 3Q, can you kind of dig into what weighed on that pace there? And do you anticipate an uptick in 4Q? 
David Ossip: Q4 is always the bigger quarter. Q3 is normally a lighter quarter. So yes, we are expecting many more accounts to go live in Q4 over the Q3, which is typical for the actual period. In terms of the number of accounts, it's largely being driven by the size of the accounts that are going live. So if we take live, for example, a 50,000 employee account, if I compare that to historical trends, where we're taking live, say, 1,000 employee counts, the 50,000 would count for effectively 50. So we look at it more on an LTM basis now, which gives us more of an average type of trend for the actual business. 
Erik Zimmer: Next up, we've got Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho. 
Sitikantha Panigrahi: Congratulation, a solid quarter. I wanted to David dig into the international market. That used to be 1 of your growth drivers in genital expense and you talked about a couple of years back. Now are you expanding your payroll -- native payroll, and also, you talked about some of these global wins as well. Tell us like what you're seeing and when do you think it will be a material contributor to your revenue from international market? 
David Ossip: So look, our goal, I would say probably about a 3-year basis, we'll push about 25% of our revenue onto a global basis. It might come quicker, it might take a bit longer, but we generally are moving in that direction. We definitely have advanced relative to all of the other players in the market in terms of global payroll and global core HR. Obviously, having a lot of success in market with companies that are headquartered outside of North America as well as companies inside North America that have global operations. At CWT, we actually discussed with the client base in 9 additional countries that we're adding in 2022 in terms of native payroll capability. And again, I think that just positions us very well in market to win these global accounts. 
 We definitely are seeing an increase in demand for core HR systems and talent suites and compliance modules that cut across the globe to give organizations that single experience for all of their employees regardless of where they live and work. 
Sitikantha Panigrahi: That's great. And then a follow-up to Dayforce Wallet. That's good to see the acceleration in new customer sign as well as go live this quarter versus last quarter. But then you talked about streaming pay introduced in October and also the CWT or the event. How should we think about the ramp in Dayforce Wallet in next few quarters? And when do you think it will be reasonable for you to start disclosing other metrics like revenue or any other revenue contribution? 
David Ossip: I think we'll probably start late next year on the revenue contribution. As you know, it's still a new business for us. What I can say, if I look at the business on a quarter-over-quarter basis, it's effectively doubling every quarter. So we're still going through the kind of the early stages of what I call hyper growth of it. Some of the metrics that I'll point you to, I believe, last quarter, we spoke about the average registration across all eligible employees to be about 25%. It's now over 29%. And when we look at customers that have been live over a year, we're seeing registration rates in the top quarter, well above 50% with the very strong usage metrics that we discussed. Those 25 transactions that people are doing everyday living. It's fast-food, grocery, convenience, gas, ATM withdrawals and the like. So that excites us quite nicely. 
 In the quarter as well, we released 2 days early or up to 2-day early deposit, which means that if you're a Dayforce Wallet user, you can get paid when you want and say you take out 1/3 of your net earnings during the period, you'll remaining 2/3, you can get up to 2 days early as well. And again, the whole model is predicated on no direct fees to the employees, no membership fees, no fees to the organization. And every payment is a true payroll, which means it's fully compliant to get an earnings slip for every type of transfer. 
 The streaming of pay will come online, as we mentioned, in 2022. We believe that will obviously accelerate because the idea over there is instead of doing an on-demand pay or having to wait for direct deposit as I work the pay automatically strains into my wallet, and we're talking about making access to your earnings completely instantaneous, and that will obviously be paired with quite a very rich financial wellness offering set with inside the actual product. So we are quite excited with it. 
 Dayforce wallet, by the way, also has given us a tremendous advantage in market. We are still seeing attachment rates across new business well across 80%. And in every conversation that I have with clients, with early clients, the Dayforce wallet is top of mind. 
Erik Zimmer: Next up is Mark Marcon with Baird. 
Mark Marcon: Congratulations on the great Dayforce results. You had a number of significant wins. I'm just wondering if you could characterize a little bit who you ended up winning from like you mentioned luxury global automotive companies, largest car rental organization. I mean those are all really long large enterprises. You had a number of international ones. Who are you replacing? How is the scope of the opportunities changing in terms of the pipeline? And how is the recognition from Gartner impacting your ability to sell? 
David Ossip: Mark, the first thing I would say is we're seeing more and more customers, larger customers buy the full HCM suite. I believe the number is 36% of clients today buy a full HCM suite. And so the takeaway from that is that we are now being seen not only as a compliance player, compliance being payroll benefits, time and workforce management, but also a leader in talent intelligence, core HR, data analytics and all of the other pieces that comprise a very rich and robust and engaging system for employees. As we've gone upmarket, we obviously are seeing more add backs against the ERPs and I'm quite proud of our success over there. We do also compete, as you know, against the more traditional human capital management and payroll customers. And obviously, our win rates over there are quite nicely. 
 In terms of the wins, usually, we're replacing a more legacy type of payroll or time solution, either client server or mainframe based. We're also seeing replacement of more legacy-based ERP systems that might be or not through cloud. And obviously, we replace a lot of different point solutions when it comes to various types of talent modules. 
Mark Marcon: That's great. And then you've got a lot of different growth opportunities, government, international, digital wallet. How is that going to impact your investment perspective for next year? How should we think about EBITDA margins in the short term relative to all of the investment opportunities that you have? 
David Ossip: Look, our focus is on growth. We still have a relatively small market share whether it be in North America on a global basis. So we believe what's right for the company is to invest more on growth than on increasing the actual EBITDA. We are going to continue investing in product and technology, sales and marketing. 
 In terms of our 5 growth factors, which we always speak about, number one, acquiring new customers, we're obviously doing very well, still have a long way to go, a lot of white space. Two, increasing the actual platform. Jared spoke about some really tremendous innovations in terms of what we bring in to market and that allows us to expand the platform go back to the base. And remember, add-ons remain at around 25% every single quarter. 
 Moving into the enterprise space. I've spoken about that, but it's not only moving into the enterprise space on a payroll benefit and time perspective, we really are talking about moving into enterprise space on a full HCM basis. Again, 36% of customers are now buying the full HCM suite. We've spoken a lot about the global opportunity. And in a number of years, I expect about 25% of our revenues come from the global basis. And then, of course, we have the adjacent markets, which is the Dayforce wallet, which there's a lot of excitement and the metrics look very good. So in terms of long-term growth for the company, we are obviously very excited. And as you mentioned, when it comes down to the annual budget, there are a lot of considerations and trade-offs as to which of the 5 different growth factors we emphasized. 
Mark Marcon: Should we just assume -- go ahead. 
Noemie Heuland: We're also looking at the cloud recurring gross margin, which is 1 of the key indicator for us because that's really what's going to fuel the long-term sustainability and profitability of the business. And that indicator keeps going up. It was up 290 basis points, excluding float this quarter. So that's really what we're looking at as we scale as well. 
Mark Marcon: So investors should probably deemphasize looking at EBITDA margin from the short-term perspective over the next year, just given all the investment opportunities and really focus on the recurring cloud gross margin in terms of [indiscernible]? 
David Ossip: I think Noemie has emphasized a very important point. It's 1 that we have continued to talk about from the time we went public that it's a metric that we look at internally, which is whether or not the growth, the cloud recurring gross margin is expanding alongside revenue. And I would say that it's going up very nicely. As Noemie mentioned, it's up 290 basis points, almost 3% on a constant currency basis year-over-year, even given the headwinds that we still have from the -- sorry, from the employment headwinds. 
Erik Zimmer: Next up is Matthew Pfau from William Blair. 
Matthew Pfau: David, at the World Tour, you discussed the elastic workforce and some functionality that Ceridian was potentially working on in that area in terms of connecting employers with employees. Maybe you can just provide some more comments on your vision in that area? And how you think about that market opportunity? 
David Ossip: Thanks, Matt here. I've spoken about this for quite some time. I always spoke about the technology, having 3 sequential steps of delivery. The first step was to build out the continuous engine that would allow us to calculate net earnings as someone worked. And that's obviously quite a difficult thing to do, and we believe we have quite a competitive merger around us in that we can do that and the others can't. 
 The second step was creating the payment rails, so that not only would we calculate net earnings in real time, but we could also pay people in real time, and that came down to the Dayforce wallet, and we've seen great traction. The third part was, well, if I download the Dayforce wallet, and we know who you are, the KYC process. We know you have the right to work. We know what your certifications are. We know that you're a safe person. We also know inside the Dayforce application, what all the local jurisdictional rules are for things like overtime, minimum wages, premium pay and the like. And we also have the capability through the Dayforce app to allow you to clock in and clock out via geo locations. 
 In that case, what we can do is we can make it very easy for organizations to publish their vacancies. And a vacancy could be a number of hours, say, a shift that has to be worked. It could be a task such as a delivery or could be a longer-term assignment, say, a 3-, 4-week program in this time. And along with the vacancy, the organization could publish the competencies required and possibly even some learning management contract. We can then allow all of the Dayforce Wallet users to look at their app and much like they'll be looking for awards around them, they'll be able to see the vacancies for which they have the right competencies. They could learn about the vacancy through the learning management content, apply, get matched and when they actually show up, they would show a QR code to clock in and clock out. And as soon as their hours were approved, they would actually get paid. And as Ceridian would be responsible for doing all the necessary remittances. We're doing all of the year-end filings, all of the different types of money movement. And you would go now from just not only having instant access to your earnings, but you'd have the ability to actually find work and get paid in real time, which we believe matches where the workforce is going. 
 So we're quite excited with that opportunity. We've started the actual research and the build-out and the partnerships that I think will enable us to do that. Obviously, leveraging the great stuff that we already have through the Dayforce continuous calculation engine the Dayforce Wallet payment rails. 
Matthew Pfau: Got it. Got it. And then just a follow-up on some of the other features that you discussed at the World Tour specifically around some of the AI and self-service features. How do you think about those from an ROI perspective when you're selling to prospective customers? And is that an important point of the conversation? 
David Ossip: So Matthew, everything we built, we tie back down to a KPI that we can impact at a customer. And as we've always said, that KPI needs to be measured measurable and convertible into a money saving. For us, we use the term quantifiable value, and I believe we're ranked #1 in industry in terms of delivering strong ROI. 
 When we talk about the Dayforce Wallet, we talk about some very strong metrics that show basically the decrease in attrition rates. The decrease in the first 90-day attrition rates, the quicker time to actually hire someone. So as we actually build it out, it's always along the same lines. 
 In terms of the talent intelligence, what we would say today is the market operates in something called Talent 1.0. And at a high level, it's really people operating this list management framework. If I'm recruiting, I look at a list of candidates for a particular job requisition. I sought or I filter that list accordingly. I find the candidate that I'd like to act on, and then I go through a number of sequential steps usually manually driven. 
 In Talent 2.0 that we're beginning to release now, we're moving more to a recommendation and prediction type of model, very similar to, for instance, when you go to Amazon or Netflix and those systems recommend either products that you would like or movie shows or TV shows that meet your requirements. We're doing the same now on the talent side. When I go to that list of candidates, it's not a list, but a set of recommended candidates that the system has predicted will be a good match based on who the hiring manager is and who the recruiter. And then even once we have that, we can go and use a lot of automation like align the candidate to self-schedule, when the candidate interacts with the system, we can engage with bot technology. So if the candidate is applying for 1 particular type of job based on the candidate who is applying and the available job requisitions, we can recommend back to the candidate where they may be a good fit for other opportunities, and at that point in time, get them to engage and or even complete the application for them. So it's effectively using ML models and AI models to go and look at what's been done currently in talent in order to engage with people in a much more natural manner that they would typically expect. 
 In terms of the service desk over there, there's a lot of information that the Dayforce system has. As you know, we've already moved into natural workspaces, you can now engage with the system through Teams or through Slack in a very natural way. We can now allow the employee to ask questions about policy. What is the vacation policy as opposed to just how many days do I have? Am I eligible for something? And by doing that, we can take a lot of load off the HR department. And again, given that's driven off of ML type of model continually evolves, continually learns and becomes more of a natural way of interacting with the system. So obviously, a lot of excitement in order to get around intelligence and data. 
 If you do come to the Ceridian World Tour, which you, obviously, came in Vegas, before others, you'll see Joe talk about that, and we actually have a few demonstrations of the technology, which is really exciting. 
Erik Zimmer: Up next, we've got Samad Samana from Jefferies. Samad? 
Samad Samana: So maybe, David, first for you, just as I think about the international side, the company has done M&A around that. And clearly, the commentary this quarter was positive around traction. How should we think about maybe international bookings or like new book dollars in this quarter versus prior quarters? And maybe how should international as a percentage of new booked dollars going forward? 
David Ossip: Samad, I don't think we've actually included that in the actual numbers. I don't have them off hand, but obviously, the global business continues to do very well, not only on the sales side. But if I look at global implementations, we're seeing a lot of success both in EMEA and across APJ's in terms of getting customers live and referenceable. As we go into the upmarket space, it's almost a certainty that we're always selling our global systems, whether, as I mentioned, they are globally headquartered companies or whether they're based in North America. In some instances, we actually see both. If you look at the shareholder letter, we actually speak about an automotive company headquartered out of Germany. There were actually 2 separate processes we went through. One was for the dealers that they have across Germany and the other 1 was for their kind of more global manufacturing operations. So we're just kind of a benefit from having both of those. And obviously, as you go through the risk profile and become a vendor, or the overall organization, there's a lot of benefit and a lot of growth we see across the globe. 
Samad Samana: Great and then on the Canadian federal government deal, it was great to see that that's been brought back now as the world reopens. Is that included in the guidance for the fourth quarter? Is there any revenue contribution from that? And then just how should we think about the impact of that on maybe the near-term EBITDA outlook maybe even into 2022? Or just how should we think about the margins -- the margin impact from that? 
David Ossip: So there's a little bit of service revenue and a small amount of subscription revenue inside the actual quarter, but I wouldn't call out as being material. Where we are with the government of calendar, we're in the midst of the planning phases for the experimental pilot for the first department inside the government. Obviously, the majority of that work effort in terms of executing across the pilot will happen in 2022. It's also obviously that the GOC will require more departments to be included in the pilot to test the various elements of the actual system. So it's likely that the number of departments will be expanded more thoroughly as we move forward as well. 
Samad Samana: Great. And then maybe just if I could squeeze in a third one, which is just I know I heard the question about the employment recovery. I wanted to ask a different way, given just how many companies you're exposed to, so regularly as the CEO of a large HR payroll company is? When you think about the hiring within the base, is it a safe assumption to assume everybody will get back to the same levels where they were all else equal before the pandemic? I mean I guess I'm just curious how much if there's automation or if there's hiring plans have shifted where they're more efficient and don't need to get back to those levels? Is that something we should think about as well as far as same-store sales growth goes within the installed base? 
David Ossip: If you ask me Samad, I do think that they'll end up with employment levels above where they were pre-pandemic. There are a number of factors. I do think the economy is growing very, very quickly. And so companies are not hiring back to their previous levels but are hiring above their levels. The second part is I do think there are a lot of new companies that have entered the economy that didn't exist pre the pandemic. And those companies are actually hiring as well. So I do think we'll move back to very full employment inside the economy as we go into 2022. 
Erik Zimmer: Up next, we've got Arvind Ramnani with Piper Sandler. 
Arvind Ramnani: David, I want to ask a bit more about Dayforce Wallet. I know you provided lot of color on Siti's question on Dayforce Wallet. But a couple of questions I have on a Dayforce Wallet. One is, what are some of the second derivative benefits of Dayforce Wallet? I mean, I think the revenue portion is going to be interesting when you start to provide it next year. But can you just talk about some of the second derivative like impact on win rates, ability to charge clients more or engagement? Just some of the second derivative benefits would be great. 
David Ossip: Look, the first is obviously our run rate goes up because what we are allowing companies to do is to move to paying people immediately without them having to change the way that they fund their payroll and without any cost to them in terms of subscription fees or fees to their employees. So it's a tremendous benefit to both the organization and to their employees. In fact, an organization could go from a weekly or biweekly payroll to a monthly payroll and get a onetime lift of working capital as well. They wanted additional benefit. So I think that's becoming very important. The second is what I would say is that the desire to get paid immediately is becoming a requirement in business today. It's no longer optional. So the economy is moving there, and we have better tech than I think anyone else in the market in that every time we move the money, we do a true payroll that is fully compliant at a federal on the state or provincial basis in Canada. And I think that's very, very strong as well. When we're going to some deals, we actually are seeing them very focused on the Dayforce Wallet. There have been in some cases where that has allowed us to maintain or actually increase pricing just based on the advantage that we have inside the market. And the last piece as well is that I do believe it does help our brand with the employees of our customers. And so I would expect over time that we become the preferred choice of HCM solution, not only for the organizations, but for the worker as well. 
Arvind Ramnani: Terrific. And then getting back to the first derivative impact. What is the sort of revenue model? I mean, from what I've understood it, it's like maybe like an interchange, 80 bps or something. So 2 questions. What is the business model? And I understand there's an interchange fee associated with -- when they use the debit card to pay for it. But in the situation where someone pulls, let's say, $1,000 and they say $800 is going to go into my bank account, $200 to stay in my debit card. Is there revenue to be gained even from that $800 that goes into the bank account. 
David Ossip: So first of all, currently, we don't see many transfers of the actual cards. What we're actually seeing is the 80-day spending from the cards. And as we mentioned, there's about 25 transactions per month, they average probably about $30 per transaction, usually on day-to-day living. When someone does an ACH transfer which, again, we don't see much of that, there isn't any fee to the actual employee. Next year, we will move into what they call OCT transfers or instant transfers. And over there, there is an ability to charge for that. Usually, it is 50 basis points up to a small cap that discharge for that particular type of transfer. What we are seeing in terms of the usage of the wallet is becoming quite disruptive to the credit card industry. So instead of using the credit card, we're seeing a lot of the employees are now using the Dayforce card instead. In that way, there obviously are more on top of their finances and they don't get into a situation where they are paying the 22% on the balance of the actual statement at the end of the month. There's a big benefit from them. In terms of additional revenue opportunities, as we move into next year, we start moving into things like rewards and we'll probably move into the areas like buy now, pay later. And all of those types of opportunities address the ability to increase our take rate. For example, on the rewards, we would expect to get about 90 basis points on the actual spend for that particular type of item that was covered by the reward on buy now, pay later basis, there would obviously be a revenue share with the partner over there. 
Erik Zimmer: Next up is Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo. 
Michael Turrin: I know there was 1 here earlier already and appreciate the seasonal dynamics in the model. But the net go-live number does look a little lighter than what we were expecting. And I'm wondering if that's at all tied to labor constraints, either on services or the partner side or if it is truly reflective of a move up market and towards partners? And if so, if that suggests that maybe you're likely to see even more of a Q4 seasonal weighting in the model either this year or just on a go-forward basis? 
David Ossip: Mike, it was largely tied to just the size of customers. So I wouldn't read anything to it. And last year, we used to say, look at it on a half year basis because it evens out between quarters. Typically, you always have the Q4 as being the biggest quarter because in the U.S., customers want to avoid the first quarter reconciliation. So the Q4, we're expecting obviously a very healthy go-live. Quite honestly, internally, we track it at a dollar value of go-lives. So we look at their cap on go-live in the quarter, we don't really focus on the actual number. The other part about that, the number isn't really what I'd call a pure number because when you have a customer that goes live in a different country, if they have contracted through a different type of entity it could be viewed as from finance as a go-live second go-live, whereas, from STEM perspective, we would actually view it as 1 system. So again, I would encourage you to look at the LTM basis more than anything else. I wouldn't read too much into it. 
Michael Turrin: If you want to give us the PEPM go-live metric, David, we'll take that, too. But maybe you can talk... 
David Ossip: That's a question for Noemie. I'm just a customer. 
Michael Turrin: Maybe you could talk about just the incremental Dayforce metric that's now above $200,000. So I'm just wondering if there is a ceiling at all there or if you think that continues to trend higher, given you are just hitting new thresholds and milestones there as well? 
David Ossip: No, look, the way I look at it, it's a rectangle. And on the x-axis, you have the number of employees, which obviously is growing all the time. And then on the y-axis is the PEPM, the pricing that we get for those. And as we increase the number of modules that we have with the customer, we go up on that y-axis as well. And so I would expect it to continue going up. 
Erik Zimmer: Next up, we've got Brad Clark from BMO. 
Bradley Clark: I want to focus on the payroll strategy. You announced a lot of new countries to build out for 2022. Looks like a lot focused on the agent path. And so on a broader level, I just want to see if you can discuss your strategy around payroll rollout? And when how do you expect to see the impact of the new payrolls on winning Dayforce customers? 
David Ossip: Yes. So Brad, a great question. Currently, we're actually focused, I would say, on 3 regions. The first region would be North America. And obviously, you'll probably see us move into Mexico in the short term as well to cover and complete the North America rollout. That obviously will have impact on manufacturing customers with inside North America. The second area we're quite focused is in on EMEA. We've got a very good presence, as you know, in U.K. and Ireland. I've seen really tremendous traction in Germany, and we're launching the native payroll solution for Germany next year as well, and we're seeing quite a lot of interest in that. Once we have Germany, we, obviously, are going to expand into the other [indiscernible] countries surrounding Germany to get a road of footprint across EMEA. 
 The third area, as you pointed out, is across APJ. Obviously, the reason we're doing that is that we do have a lot of what we call bureau customers, so customers through the acquisitions of Ascender and Excelity and RITEQ. And as we build out the native capabilities for those regions, that gives us an opportunity to go back to the base and not only move their payroll onto Dayforce, but also add on things like time and attendance, workforce management, core HR and all of the talent modules, which obviously is a very large revenue opportunity for us. 
 Also within APJ, we've got quite well kind of integrated go-to-market. So we have sales and marketing across the region, a big presence across areas like Singapore, A&D and other areas across. We also have service and implementation capabilities in market, which means we can get to market quite quickly. And as we move into 2022, you'll start to see us focus more on what we call the migration and the upsell of the incumbent base, which is about 1,500 customers in region. Noemie, anything that you would add to that? 
Noemie Heuland: No, you covered it all. 
Erik Zimmer: Next up is Robert Simmons from D.A. Davidson. 
Unknown Analyst: So you talked about wallet monetization, but for streaming pay as the money isn't going into wallet and you said that it's not going to be any charges simply, what is the revenue model there? 
David Ossip: It's the Same model, Robert. It is -- streaming pay comes on board next year. It's effectively the same as on demand pace. So the current experience at the moment is I look at my mobile device, it tells me how much net earnings I have earned. So that is what is my growth, that all of my taxes and deductions, and then I can elect say, I'd like $50 added to my Dayforce Wallet or card. When I do that, I wait for about 5 to 10 seconds, and then 5 to 10 seconds, we doing our calculation going back about a year, we're actually creating an earnings slip and we're actually funding the card immediately, but just about a 10-second wait and the reason is to look at their balance before they spend. Where streaming pay, I elect to stream my pay. And as I earn the money flows on to my wallet at the end of every day. I don't have to do the on-demand transaction when it goes on to the card, we still get exactly the same interchange when they go often spend or through the other types of transactions on the card. 
Unknown Analyst: Got it. Okay. So I thought it was going directly into the comp. I guess that was not correct. 
David Ossip: Yes, it goes onto the Dayforce Wallet. 
Unknown Analyst: Got it. Okay. And then do you have any preview, what you're going to be giving us next week at the investor track? 
David Ossip: With the investor track, we actually wanted you to do is provide an opportunity for the investors to meet the executive team. So in the executive track, we'll have it moderated by Leagh Turner. Leagh will also have Joe Korngiebel, our Chief Products and Technology Officer, we'll have Chris Armstrong, our Chief Customer Officer. Well, obviously, we'll have Noemie, we'll have Erik, we'll have Seth Ross, your heads up our Consumer Group. Erik, Noemie, who else am I missing in the group? So I think we wanted to have quite a -- allow people to have a dialogue with a broader set of the executive team. 
Erik Zimmer: Yes, that's right. There's a couple of other executives. And then what we've done is we've curated the actual customer sessions earlier and kind of selected a few that we think will be most applicable to investors. 
 And for our last question of the night, Bhavin Shah from Deutsche Bank. 
Bhavin Shah: I mean just maybe focusing on the SI partnerships. Can you just provide us an update on what you're seeing in terms of these guys adding more to the pipeline opportunities. Is this something that we should expect as we go into next year once you start probing more deals? 
David Ossip: Yes. So actually, a great question on that. Obviously, we're seeing the number of opportunities brought to us by the SIs go up sizable, a large margin. Obviously, we started off at a base of 0. So you can expect to see very rapid increases on a percentage basis, but we're very happy with these growth of the pipeline that has been influenced by the SIs. So that's the first piece we're seeing. Second piece is we have got more SIs priming Dayforce implementations, which allows us to continue growing, especially on a global basis. Without having to necessarily continue to build out our own services group internally, it allows us to focus on really doing what we do great, which is build great software and deliver grade software and obviously service to create software. In terms of the partner network, we are well above 20 SI partners who have resources who are trained at CWT in Vegas, we have a very good chain by them, and I believe we'll see quite a few of them at the New York event as well. 
Bhavin Shah: Got it. Super helpful. Just a quick follow-up on wallet. I mean, nice to see the continued growth in terms of go-lives and the adoption from the employee base. But maybe can you provide any information on what you're seeing in terms of your customers providing more of an employee's paycheck available in terms of on an on-demand basis, whether you're seeing them increase it from 30% to 50% or 50% to 70% and like what's that trend been like? 
David Ossip: Yes. The 2 types of comes, those have put guardrails so they're limited to 50% and others that give full access. When I look at the overall population, it appears about 30% of individuals who use their wallet move their wages on to the wallet before the end of the pay period. If they use it for direct deposit, and we've seen the direct deposit business actually go up quite nicely. They get access to those funds 2 days earlier than they normally would as well. So to answer your question, I don't think it actually has been driven by the organization, just given that your natural amount movement onto the water seems to be about 30% of the actual wages. Once we start doing a 3-minute of pay, I would expect that to go higher. And we're also starting to emphasize now the direct deposit side. And so if you get the direct deposit, you effectively get all of it at the end of the actual period as well. 
 Erik, just to pass it back to you. 
Erik Zimmer: Yes. Thanks, David. And with that question, that concludes our call for tonight. So on behalf of Noemie, David and the rest of the Ceridian executive team, we thank you very much for your time this evening, and we look forward to continuing the conversation throughout the quarter. 
David Ossip: Great. Thank you, everyone, and I look forward to speaking to many of you tonight and tomorrow, and I hope to see a lot of you next week as well. Thank you very much. 
Noemie Heuland: Bye.

 With that, I will turn the call over to David. 
David Ossip: Thanks, Jeremy, and good evening, everyone. Thank you for joining the call today. 
 Before we go into Q&A, I want to spend a few minutes on some key points from the quarter. First, we had strong financial performance in the second quarter. Our results were meaningfully above guidance across all metrics. Dayforce recurring revenue, excluding float revenue, grew by 30%. Total revenue, including Powerpay and Bureau, also grew by 30%. Cloud recurring gross margin was 72%, up 130 basis points year-over-year and up 200 basis points, excluding float revenue. 
 Based on our solid execution and increased confidence in employment levels at our customers, we are raising our guidance, and we now expect third quarter Dayforce recurring revenue, excluding float revenue, to grow 31% to 32%; fourth quarter Dayforce recurring revenue, excluding float revenue, to grow 32% to 33%; full year total revenue between $1.008 billion and $1.018 billion; adjusted EBITDA between $155 million and $165 million. 
 We were also pleased with our second quarter sales performance, which was both above 2019 and 2020. We continue to see success in the enterprise and large enterprise segments, and we also saw solid traction in the major market segments. Our pipeline is strong, and we expect healthy sales performance to continue into the second half of 2021. 
 Second, employee count at our Dayforce customers began to show improvement compared to the last quarter. The average employee count per Dayforce customer is now larger than pre-pandemic levels, reflective of our move into enterprise and also better employment levels. This is expected to positively benefit our second half revenue. 
 Finally, we have seen strong market momentum for Dayforce Wallet. We now have more than 600 customers signed with over 200 customers live on the Dayforce Wallet. Inside our top quartile of live customers, registration rates are averaging about 40% of eligible users. We are now seeing impressive traction and spending patterns further positioning the Dayforce card as top-of-wallet, go-to card for spending earned money. The average active wallet holder loads money onto their wallet 5 to 6x per month at an average of approximately $120 below. And in addition, an average active user transacts with the card approximately 24 times per month, almost every day. 
 In summary, our execution was strong across segments and geographies, and our financial performance exceeded expectations. We are seeing significant momentum across all areas of the company. 
 We also have reopened our offices in the U.S. And I've been thrilled to see the level of engagement from our employees whom I have met in various town halls across the country. I have also been busy visiting our customers at their offices throughout the U.S. And some consistent themes have emerged: first, their desire to improve the well-being and productivity of their workforce; second, their challenges to maintain and unify the company culture in an environment where employees expect and do work from anywhere in a hybrid fashion; and finally, their difficulties attracting and retaining talent in a very competitive talent market. I left each of these in-person conversations with the conviction that we are uniquely positioned to address these challenges and help our customers be more competitive. 
 I would now like to hand it back to Jeremy to open the call up for questions. 
Jeremy Johnson: Thanks, David. [Operator Instructions] 
Jeremy Johnson: The first question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho. 
Sitikantha Panigrahi: It's really nice to see this 30% recurring revenue growth. You're back to the 30%, even guiding 30%-plus in the second half. So I want to dig a little bit into your confidence level, mainly what's your expectation in terms of employment going into the second half, Q3, Q4. And also, specifically on the enterprise segment traction, what are you seeing there, mainly how are SIs helping you? And how does that change your activation or revenue recognition in the enterprise deals? 
David Ossip: Sure. So in terms of employee headwinds, in the quarter, we saw employee headwinds of $6 million in Q2, which was in line of what we had expected. For Q3, we expect a $3 million headwind, so an improvement of $3 million. And in Q4, we expect it to only be $1.5 million. That's on the Dayforce side. On the Powerpay side, in Q2, we saw a headwind of $1.5 million. In Q3, we expect it to improve to a headwind of $1 million and, in Q4, a headwind of $0.5 million. Our traction, Siti, in the enterprise segment and as well in what we call major market 2, which is the upper segment of the major market, remains very strong. We saw both a nice increase in ACV year-over-year, and we also saw a significant increase in the volume of deals coming through the system as well. 
Sitikantha Panigrahi: Okay. And then quick follow-up on the Dayforce Wallet side. It's good to see the traction there, now 200 customer live. So what could you do further to drive registration? Like, you talked about 40% in some instances, so what else -- what have we learned in last 1 year to drive further penetration? Do you have to rely on the HR of your customer, the HR department of your customer? Or can you do something else? 
David Ossip: Yes, it's a great question. There are 2 parts to that. The first is when we look at the top quartile of our customers, it's largely the customers who have been live the longest. So what we're seeing is month-over-month, the registration rates of eligible employees at our customers go up. And as I mentioned, the top quartile, we're seeing numbers about 40%. The second piece that we actually see as well is that we do have specific initiatives on the product side that we're adding, things like referrals, so I can refer a friend, give $10, get $10, and that will come online in the next few months. We also have added a messaging component into the actual system that will allow us to, again, encourage people to use the system. We've added enhancements on the direct deposit side to help people set up the Dayforce Wallet as their primary direct deposit account. And there are various other initiatives we're doing on the product side that we believe will continue to drive not only registration but usage of the card. 
Jeremy Johnson: Our next question comes from the line of Jared Levine, who's in place for Bryan Bergin, of Cowen. 
Jared Levine: Has there been any change in the competitive environment, particularly against ADP or UKG this past quarter? 
David Ossip: Not really, Jared. I would say that it's been largely consistent since we've actually IPO-ed. As you know, we have 2 prime competitors in major markets. When we go upmarket into the enterprise and large enterprise segment, it shifts a bit more to the ERP side. 
Jared Levine: Got you. And then in terms of Dayforce Wallet, can you provide an update in terms of that revenue you're seeing per active user? Is it still pretty much an effective doubling of that PEPM with those active registered users? 
David Ossip: That's about right. Jeremy, have we provided the actual ARPU per account? I don't think so, right? 
Jeremy Johnson: We have not. 
David Ossip: But generally, it's in line that we can effectively see a doubling of the recurring revenue per active user. 
Jeremy Johnson: The next question comes from Daniel Jester at Citi. 
Daniel Jester: Yes. Thanks, Jeremy. I noticed that wallet was launched in Canada earlier this month. Can you just help us think about the market in Canada versus the U.S.? I think there's clearly other competitors that are trying to do on-demand pay in the U.S. But help us think about what the opportunity in Canada could look like, please? 
David Ossip: Dan, it's looking at various similar. Right out of the gate, we've got very good traction with the wallet in Canada, which is really tremendous to see. We're seeing registration rates follow those what we're seeing inside the actual U.S. It's a slight difference in that, in the U.S., you do have an unbanked or low-banked population that's smaller in Canada. But surprisingly, the registration, the desire to use the wallet doesn't seem to be any different in Canada versus the U.S. We had some great coverage with the actual launch. If you haven't seen, there's a piece on CTV News that I encourage you to look at. What was great about that is that they interviewed random people on the street to test the value of the actual wallet, and the results were really great. 
Daniel Jester: Great. And then in the shareholder letter, there's a metric that incremental Dayforce recurring revenue per customer was up 8% year-over-year. If I go back a few quarters, I think that was like 13% or higher. So maybe just help me think about sort of what's driving the deceleration here because client growth, sort of live Dayforce customers, has been pretty steady. But that metric seems to have come down. Sort of what's driving that, please? 
David Ossip: It's mostly, Dan, overlapping. So we started to move into the enterprise segment. So we got a nice lift-up into the enterprise segment. So when we look at it at the moment, I think you need to look at it kind of on an ex float basis. The number is actually 11% inside the quarter. So if I look at Q2 of 2021 to Q2 of 2020, it went from $93,656 to $103,757, which is up about 11% year-over-year. 
Daniel Jester: I'll follow up off-line. 
David Ossip: Thanks. 
Jeremy Johnson: Next question comes from Mark Marcon of Baird. 
Mark Marcon: Congrats on the strong results. I'm wondering, can you talk a little bit about some of the wins that you ended up having during the quarter. And I'm particularly interested in the international wins. In particular, Coupa, can you talk a little bit about where you're seeing the international wins come from, what the pace of momentum is like and how you're feeling about international just in terms of being able to drive new sales? 
David Ossip: First, the growth on the global side is tremendous year-over-year, both in the number of deals that we're doing, the number of deals we're doing with the actual SIs and the revenue side has gone up quite significantly year-over-year. In terms of the particular types of wins, obviously, we had Coupa, which is just a tremendous software company, I think everyone knows about that, operating on a global basis. What I love about that one is that it's great evidence that we are very competitive in the software industry as well. We had a great fitness company that I think everyone knows, everyone uses. Everyone probably has a subscription to them on a global basis. I know that my wife and family have been supporting them for quite a long time. 
 D&B also, obviously, a great win as well in financial services. And then we have the typical -- we had a great, I want to call them, environmental resourcing company out of Europe, which is a great name that we got, and typical retail and veterinarian types of clinics. So we had a very nice and strong quarter when it came to winning globally and in the domestic markets. 
Mark Marcon: Who do you win Coupa from? Can you say? 
David Ossip: It was against the big ERP that you would expect. 
Mark Marcon: Okay. Great. And then just in terms of the guidance, can you talk a little bit about some of the drivers with regards to the EBITDA guidance? You're obviously investing, there's obviously all sorts of different opportunities, where is the incremental investment coming? 
David Ossip: Yes. So let me just start by talking about EBITDA in the quarter because, as you can see, it came in meaningfully above the actual guide. In fact, we came in about $9 million I think, above the [ high ] of our guide for the quarter on EBITDA. If you look at it from a dollar perspective, it was up 6.4% year-over-year. We've kept the EBITDA number conservative because we are investing quite heavily in product. And if you read through the shareholder letter, we've highlighted a lot of the number of initiatives that we're actually doing. We're obviously doing a tremendous amount of investment in the Dayforce wallets as well. 
 And we also are investing heavily in in-person marketing events, which we didn't have in the prior quarters. We have the World Tour that's coming up that is really exciting. We're starting that in Vegas and New York, and then we'll follow up as soon as possible in the U.K. and in Singapore. We've been doing some smaller sales events and customer events in New York. We'll have one coming up in L.A. in about 2 weeks' time as well. So a little bit more on the marketing spend. 
 Noemie, anything that you would want to comment on? 
Noemie Heuland: I think you've covered it well. In Q2, we had obviously a beat in our adjusted EBITDA versus what we had guided, which is primarily as a result of the revenue beat that we saw. But we've continued to invest consistently, as we said before, in the areas that David just covered. Product and technology is a significant area of spend for us, as David mentioned, for the wallet as well as for the global expansion and native payroll capabilities. So you would expect that to continue throughout the year as well as investments in sales and marketing to support the effort to the upmarket. 
Jeremy Johnson: Our next question comes from Matt Coss at JPMorgan, who's in place for Mark Murphy. 
Matthew Coss: David, in the shareholder letter, you mentioned core delivery metrics remained strong, and continued improvement with customer satisfaction scores was something that you saw. I assume things like no starts are probably smaller or perhaps nonexistent to begin with. But to the extent that they do exist, can you talk about any headway you've made there and then perhaps, along with that, the trajectory of things like NPS scores, overall customer sets, growth in the number of customers willing to do references? 
David Ossip: Yes. So Matt, I'm going to have to ask you for clarity in the first part of your question. But the second part of your question, we've seen NPS scores go up materially year-over-year both on the implementation side and on the customer support side. We've got exceptionally strong scores now on both of those metrics. In fact, I doubt that there's anyone in the industry who is as strong as we are when it comes to NPS scores. And as you know, NPS is a very honest metric. What was the first part? Did it have to do -- do you think -- did you use the word no starts? 
Matthew Coss: Yes, no starts. Just -- like I mentioned -- I assume you probably don't have any customers who sign and then just never end up going live. But I just wanted to see if that had been... 
David Ossip: It would be the absolute rarity for us to see that going. When I look at the service organization and when I look in the actual number of kickoffs and go-lives, they've done very, very nicely. And when I look at the accuracy of our services team, being able to predict when a customer is going to go live, it's very, very strong. I think most of you know that every other week, I meet with the services team. We go through the company by different segments. Any account that has a potential, pushing more than 30%, we go deep into it. And if I look at it quarter-over-quarter, we're seeing tremendous accuracy coming out of the service team. 
Noemie Heuland: Can I add something on the services? I think we've seen the PS and other line coming back in growth territory this quarter after a couple of quarters of decline. So that's a pretty good evidence of them getting also more efficient in taking customer live. We have seen some increase in the professional services margin as well. And we had a higher share now of value-added services, which is customers purchasing our services post go-live, where we also have significant value added to help those customers taking the best ROI of the development and the implementation of the solution. 
Matthew Coss: Okay. That's helpful color. And then maybe just on the better employment levels at your customers. If you think about the jobs lost at the peak of COVID and in March and April last year, what percentage of those jobs do you think are back? And then maybe if they're not all back, when do they come back? 
David Ossip: Matt, as I actually mentioned, when I look at the average employee count across our customer base, it's actually higher now than it was pre-COVID levels, both in Canada and in the U.S. So I would actually argue that the jobs have actually come back into the actual market. And when I look at the growth in employment levels, over the last 90 days alone, we're seeing tremendous growth, 4%, 5% employment growth across inactive and active employees at our customers. 
Jeremy Johnson: The next question comes from Michael Turrin at Wells Fargo. 
Michael Turrin: Appreciate the time as always. On the international side, I want to just spend some time on Ascender. Was that, the $23 million you reported, just for level-setting in line with what you're expecting? And then I think you've said the migration is expected to kick off here in the second half of the year. Can you just talk about the expectations? I know it's a multiyear journey but how we should think about the start there and the trajectory as you kick off those efforts. 
David Ossip: Yes. So I'll start, and I'll hand it to Noemie for a bit more color. The Ascender line was $22.9 million, broken down into Dayforce recurring revenue, which came in at $5 million versus $4.5 million that we had expected. Dayforce professional services came in at $1.2 million (sic) [ $1.1 million ] versus the $1.5 million that we had expected. And Bureau came in at $16.7 million (sic) [ $16.8 million ] versus $15 million, but there were some purchase accounting adjustments that were inside that particular number. When you look at Q3 and Q4, we would expect, and included in our guidance, $4.5 million per quarter on Dayforce recurring revenue, $1.5 million on Dayforce professional services and $15 million on the actual Bureau side. The migration begins, as we mentioned, in the second half of the year. But remember that it will take time to activate those accounts, so you aren't going to see the impact of that really until 2022. 
 One other data point that we did call out inside the shareholders' letter is that when we look at RITEQ, which we purchased about 2 years ago, the Dayforce revenue that we have sold to those accounts now exceeds the total revenue of RITEQ at the time of purchase. So it's really a great data point about the strategy that we can position Dayforce. And as we do that, we get the upsell of the talent modules, the workforce management modules, which obviously increase the revenue that we can expect from those customers. 
 Noemie, anything you would add? 
Noemie Heuland: No, I think that's -- you covered it well. 
Michael Turrin: And just the wallet engagement stats, those are tremendous. We keep seeing the bread crumbs of progress there. Any color you can add on the types of transactions you're seeing? That average load metric also looks like a pretty compelling value proposition. So can we just talk about the engagement levels you're seeing and the potential for monetization there as we think about potential impacts to the model going forward? 
David Ossip: Yes. So the engagement numbers are great. As I mentioned, in the top quartile, about 40% registration rates across the clients which, I would argue, is a bit ahead of what we had expected. The second part is the loads that we're seeing have gone up slightly, but they're effectively 6x per month and at over $120 per load. And then on the spend time, we're seeing the cards be used almost daily. The average usage of the card is in excess of 24 times per month. The typical types of transactions is what you would expect. They are grocery purchases, convenience stores, gas, ATM withdrawals, which is the majority of the transactions. 
 In terms of further ways of monetizing that, we are going to launch a cash-back program with a particular partner where there is a revenue share. And we believe that could add about 0.9% of the actual spend, if you like, into revenue. There are other programs that we are looking at, things like pay now -- sorry, buy now, pay later programs that I think were further added. And then as we get into more of the financial wellness side, is really a tremendous opportunity for us. Thanks, Mike. You're actually muted. I'm not sure if you're aware. 
Michael Turrin: No, that's great. I appreciate the color. 
Jeremy Johnson: The next question comes from Brad Clark, who's in for Keith Bachman, at BMO. 
Bradley Clark: I wanted to follow up on the international trends. And specifically, could you talk more broadly about the size of the opportunity that exist now in the ANZ, greater APAC area with Ascender beyond the installed base? And then broader than that, is there any differences in demand appetite for HCM deployment between the international market, including Europe versus U.S. and Canada? Any comment you could make on sort of more global trends that you're seeing. 
David Ossip: So Brad, right of the bat, we're seeing very strong growth on the global side. If I look at the number of deals that we have in pipe today for global deals versus last year, or if I look at from a deployment perspective, the number of countries we currently are deploying in now versus what we were deploying in about a year ago, they're up in double digits. So we're talking really tremendous growth and tremendous opportunity coming through. 
 In terms of ANZ, which is actually APJ as well, there are 1,500 customers we have between Excelity and between Ascender. All of them, obviously, will lead to Dayforce. When we move to Dayforce, we obviously position the entire talent suite as well as the workforce management and payroll, which does give us a nice lift in revenue. And as I mentioned, with RITEQ, I think we've been able to prove that out that, as we migrate, a single application, like in RITEQ's case, it's workforce management only, so we sell payroll, we sell talent to the workforce management accounts. In the case of Excelity and in the case of Ascender, it's now selling workforce management, core HR and talent components onto that. We see a nice lift in revenue. 
 We also are seeing tremendous benefit from having the APJ assets on our -- on how attractive we are on a global basis to sell with companies that have operations around the world. So we're very optimistic about global. And we also do believe it is a differentiation of us relative to both the ERPs and the other HCM providers. 
Jeremy Johnson: Our next question comes from Matthew Pfau of William Blair. 
Matthew Pfau: Just wanted to ask on the partner ecosystem. So you now have relationships with some very large partners. How do you go about building on and expanding these relationships specifically to get them to start influencing more deals? And then the second one on the partner ecosystem is that you did mention in the shareholder letter that you saw continued growth in partner prime deals. But are these a meaningful component of the pipeline yet? 
David Ossip: So Matthew, to answer your first question, I think there are 3 stages that I've discussed beforehand. The first is you have to train the SIs, so they have resources available. The second is you have to allow them to prime the actual implementation so that they can take the customers live and get references. And once you do that, I think you do get the lift in pipeline. So the majority of pipeline lift, I think we're still probably a quarter or 2 away as we need to complete the implementations -- or the SIs have to complete the implementations. We are seeing some benefit already in terms of deals where we are seeing a positive impact of the SI influence coming through. 
 But another point that I think I'd like to make as well is that we are operating in a tight talent market. And the fact that we now have 19 SIs that have capability to implement is helping us because it does allow us to continue to grow and scale the company without having to hire people directly. And I think that in retrospect, it was a fantastic move to be able to build out a bench of very capable people across a range of very accomplished organizations. 
Jeremy Johnson: All right. The next question comes from Samad Samana of Jefferies. 
Samad Samana: David, good to see you. So as you can see, I'm no longer in my own home. I would love to ask a couple of questions. Maybe first, just that 0.9% rev share that you mentioned for wallet, was that when you start to rebate back? Or were you saying 0.9% -- or sorry, 90 basis points, is that the take rate that you're getting on Dayforce Wallet transactions today? Just curious what you're saying. 
David Ossip: Yes, so we still are about to launch the actual partnership. But generally, the way it works is that the employee gets a cash-back of about 4%, 5%. The network gets about 4%. We get about 40% to 50% of that revenue share. And so that's where that 90 basis points come from. 
Samad Samana: Okay. Great. And then maybe just one more housekeeping question. The Ideal acquisition, I don't know if that contributed into revenue in the quarter. I know it closed in April. I'm curious if that contributed to 2Q and, if so, which revenue segment it falls into. 
David Ossip: Sure, I'll give that one to Noemie. 
Noemie Heuland: Yes, it's a small contribution for the second quarter. Remember, it was primarily an acqui-hire where we got a lot of talented individuals, various experts in machine learning development capabilities as well as artificial intelligence. So that's the priority reason why we made this acquisition, but there's a slight -- a couple of hundred thousand dollars in the Q2 number, to be precise. 
Samad Samana: Great. And then maybe zooming out a little bit, David, it sounds like the bookings in 2Q were nicely up over the prior 2 years' second quarters. I'm curious, when you think about the new customers that you've been adding, how many of those were in the pipeline prior to COVID? And I guess as I think about the current pipeline, how many are just new to sort of from a pipeline perspective where they're just completely new leads? And how is the new pipeline generation looking? 
David Ossip: So I don't actually have a number of the company we're in there prior to -- pre-COVID. Largely, I would think it actually depends on the actual segment. So if you're talking about the large enterprise, then it's likely that they were around before because it takes a while to go through those. Now if I'm talking about enterprise, major market 2 or major market 1, so it goes large enterprise, enterprise -- sorry, MM1, MM2, the major market deals typically move much quicker. 
 Most of what we are seeing, I would argue, is relatively new. As you know, we've done a tremendous number of virtual events that really have led to the build-out of the pipeline. As we've been saying for the last number of quarters, the pipeline is strong. As I mentioned in the very opening, we've seen an increase in volume of deals as well. So if I look at major market 2, and I look at the enterprise space, those particular markets seem to be moving very, very quickly relative to last year, and we've seen really, really healthy growth in those segments. 
Samad Samana: Great. Very helpful. And then I apologize for the housekeeping questions, but maybe just one last one. I know that, historically, the company has invoiced on go-live, and I think that the goal is to get more customers to start invoicing on activation. I was just wondering maybe, Noemie, how that trend is going and if -- how should we think about that flowing through the Dayforce recurring line over time? 
Noemie Heuland: Yes. We've seen a significant attach rate on what we call PEPM at provisioning for our new sales. It's actually in line with what we had expected and modeled ahead of the year, which is great because it was a new business model for us. And I think we're pleased with what we're seeing in terms of execution and customer appetite to go and sign those contracts with PEPM at provisioning. We expect that number to be significantly higher next year. So it's still ramping up as any new program. 
 And the benefit of it is -- actually, what we've observed is customers with paying recurring revenue before go-live actually getting more passionate about getting live on time, as you would expect, and actually it helps our professional services delivery team as well. So that's -- to answer your question, it's really been a program that's aligned with what we expected. The attach rate is strong, and we expect that revenue to be more material next year, and we'll start disclosing more of that. 
Samad Samana: Great. As always, great to see you all and nice to see the strong numbers. 
Jeremy Johnson: Thanks, Samad. Next question comes from Alex Zukin at Wolfe. 
Aleksandr Zukin: So David, first, maybe for you, if you think about the bookings mix, you just talked about bookings growth being pretty solid in Q2. I want to ask the question around if you think -- if you take the demand environment that you're seeing in the market right now and you look at the proportion of bookings first half versus second half and compare that to kind of traditional pre-COVID-19 periods, is there any more or less concentration of bookings? Like, is it a more back-end loaded year this year than usual kind of coming out from the pandemic, seeing some of these normalizations take time? I want to start there. 
David Ossip: Alex, generally, the linearity in our business is that you are more swayed towards H2, in particular Q4. So I think you'll see something similar again in this particular year. In terms of the recovery, it's happening quicker in certain segments, particularly in the enterprise segment and in the major market 2 segment. That's where we've seen the highest volume of actual deals coming through. When I look at the pipeline, it's strong across the board. 
Aleksandr Zukin: Got it. And then for Noemie, if I think about the numbers themselves, if I look at Dayforce recurring, ex float, constant currency, ex Ascender, ex employee tailwinds, what's the right way to think about that growth, both not in just the second half guide that you're putting up but the durability given the bookings strength, the durability? Like, what's the right way for us to think about that net new normal now that the base has roughly started to normalize? 
Noemie Heuland: I think if you start to -- I mean there's different ways you could slice and dice the number. I would argue that Ascender contribution is actually key. We've acquired those customers, and there's a plan to start cross-selling to those customers and upselling and migrating them to Dayforce. So I think that's a real -- I wouldn't necessarily back those numbers out of the normalized growth going forward. 
 I think we continue to see employment levels coming up. We expect to end the year pretty close to what we were pre-COVID. And Powerpay also has been significantly improving over the past few months, and we expect that to continue as well. So I think we'll communicate guidance for next year and expect growth rates for Dayforce recurring in due course. But I wouldn't necessarily back out Ascender and the like because that's really part of our overall strategy. And we start to see customers of the existing Ascender base actually buying some other modules, and we expect that to continue going forward. 
Aleksandr Zukin: Understood. And then, David, maybe finally, one for you. I mean we've seen both some commentary around competition. Paycom is moving upmarket increasingly on their call yesterday. You've had a new IPO. And there's -- UKG is still in the market. What's the right way to think about the competitive dynamics in the market right now, how they're different, similar and where you're either seeing incremental opportunity for share gains or sales cycles taking longer? 
David Ossip: We don't really see a lot of Paycom inside the market. And I think we rarely, if ever, see the guys at Paycom. So I don't think we've seen any particular change. Obviously, as we have gone upmarket, we do see the ERPs more than we have beforehand. They're probably up the most. In terms of competitive win rates, they are still very healthy. They haven't changed. And I think when you look at the actual product, we're quite differentiated in so many different ways that the value prop that we can offer the market causes the win rates. 
Jeremy Johnson: Next question comes from Arvind Ramnani from Piper Sandler. 
Arvind Ramnani: I had a broader-level question. With the expected stimulus sort of looking to expire in September, it feels like hiring is going to ramp up quite aggressively because I see a lot more kind of openings for jobs as opposed to kind of people willing to get back to work. Do you expect like revenue to really kind of accelerate as you exit this year and into next year, assuming the stimulus basically expires? 
David Ossip: Look, we've given guidance for the remainder of the year. And you can see that the pattern is Q3 goes up and then Q4 goes up on Q3 as well. We haven't completed our SRP yet for 2022, but I would argue there are still tailwinds when it comes to employment. When we look across our customer base, and we can obviously monitor the number of open job postings that they have and the time to close those postings, we definitely are seeing that go up. One other data point that I'll probably refer you to, if you look at the average float balance of our customers, the average float balance is up 27% year-over-year, which is usually indicative of the size of the payrolls across our customers. So another good kind of data point that the economy is coming back very strong. 
Arvind Ramnani: Terrific. And then if I look at the float balance last year, are you able to share, at least kind of ballpark, like how much of it was down? I mean you're up 27% this year versus last year. But last year versus the year before was... 
David Ossip: Sure. So if I actually look at the float balances, if I go to Q2 of 2019, it was $3.4 billion. In Q2, it obviously came down to $2.98 billion. In this year, it is $3.8 billion. So it is still quite significantly ahead of the volumes that we saw in Q2 of '19. And you can further go back a year before. If you look at Q2 of '18, it was $3.35 billion. So there is definitely a significant increase in the float balance in Q2. And we also saw, if you remember, an increase in the float balance in Q1. So it's a very good sign that the economy is coming back strong. 
Jeremy Johnson: Next question comes from Stephanie Price at CIBC. 
Stephanie Price: After selling virtually for about 18 months, it sounds like you're moving back to a little bit in-person. Just curious about how you're thinking about sales and marketing and if you're looking at any changes in the sales structure, just given remote work over the last little bit. 
David Ossip: So Stephanie, I've started actually traveling quite a bit. We did a client event in New York a few weeks ago. And to kind of give you an idea, normally, when you do these client dinners, they go from like 6:00 to 8:39. This went from 6:00 to 12:30 a.m. So I would say there's just a huge pent-up demand for people to get out and to interact again. I did 2 town halls. I did 1 in Tampa, and I did 1 in Minneapolis. And the energy inside the town halls was just wonderful to see, just people smiling and happy to be together. Next week, I'm in Chicago, doing another kind of departmental town hall, and then I'm going off to visit 2 clients as well in kind of the Midwest West area. And I'm obviously very eager for that. And then a week or so after that, I'm in the West Coast, going to San Fran and LA. In L.A., we have a nice client event. 
 I also participated in a recent user group. And so the user group is a group that's run outside of Ceridian. They run it from base camp. I was asked to kind of just join in the Q&A section. And at the end of that, I asked the question. I asked if the user group would like to get together in person if we were to help sponsor it as part of the World Tour. And we had 141 customers respond that they'd like to attend in person. So the world is definitely moving to getting out in front of people, developing relationships, building on interactions. But I would say that we are still going to be operating in a hybrid world where we can get kind of the best of virtual types of events, virtual types of selling. So a lot of digital types of programs and such mixed together with the right experiences for in-person events and such. 
Stephanie Price: That's helpful color. And then maybe a bit about the international strategy in EMEA and how we should think about the build-out there and how that should translate into larger global wins. 
David Ossip: So EMEA is going really tremendously. As I did mention, 2 metrics that we do track internally is just the bookings year-over-year and also just the number of active projects, the number of countries that we're active in, and they both are up really considerably year-over-year. In EMEA, we've got a very good sales team. In terms of kind of major countries, as you know, we have the U.K. and we have Ireland and we're also about to launch in Germany. We have resources on the ground now in Germany in the products and technology side, the services side and the sales side. So we're making quite a lot of traction over there. We're actually very encouraged not only by the sales but by the go-live traction. In the quarter, we had 2 nice go-lives of very large global accounts headquartered out of EMEA as well. 
Jeremy Johnson: Great. The next question comes from Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. 
Raimo Lenschow: Congrats from me as well. Two quick questions. First on, if I look at the client wins you had this quarter and discussed, it looks really impressive. It looks like you're moving nicely upmarket. Can you talk a little bit about -- like, the pandemic almost helped you a little bit because it gave you more time to build out and kind of get kind of more visibility higher up, and it's kind of -- sorry to say that, but I see that in the accounts that you're seeing there with Coupa, et cetera. Can you talk a little bit of what you see in terms of pipeline building there and how the vendors are seeing you against the competitors? And then I had one follow-up on the wallet, please. 
David Ossip: Look, Raimo, it's not by chance. We put in place a strategy to go upmarket starting in 2018. We made changes to the way that we actually sell. As you know, we verticalized. We brought in value advisory people who are able to kind of communicate the ROI and get ahead of the RFI/RFP process. We have invested and continue to invest very heavily in the SI channels who do influence those particular types of deals. And we brought in great people into the organization, particularly in sales leadership, that know how to communicate with the SIs and know how to communicate as well with the large enterprises. 
 One of the areas that's driving the wins we're seeing upmarket is our global capability that, if you compare us with the big core HR, workforce management payroll on a global basis, we have a lot more to offer and the solution is much better architected than others in market. And so that does help us. When I look at the enterprise segment, in the upper end or major market, we're also seeing tremendous success in the talent side. So when we brought in Joe and we brought in a number of other people, also very, very strong in talent and in data and in AI, that's now begin to show through the actual product and show through the product road map, which further has allowed us to move upmarket and to also continue selling to the base. 
Raimo Lenschow: Yes. And do you see -- the second question is, do you see an increased priority now post-pandemic that people realized, okay, the front office was probably kind of already a lot more cloud native, more modernized where the back office are still sitting in kind of old processes, old payroll. Do you think that now post pandemic, we will see an extra push of people starting to modernize a little bit more? 
David Ossip: Well, there are a couple of things. A partially modernized system doesn't work. If I have 5 different talent components and each is on a different cloud platform, the chances are I can't have the correct experiences or get access to data, which I need to run the business. So the fact that we now have very strong talent, and you see that reflected through some of the acquisitions like Ideal that we've done, which really allow us to do things in a very -- I don't like using the word modern anymore because I think modern is overplayed. But it's really making use of data and user experience to do it correctly. And so that is driving a lot of it. 
 On the compliance side, that's still a -- it drives a lot of business because it's not so much as whether it's back office or front office, it's really can you do the calculations correctly, can you pay people correctly, are you off-site from a regulatory perspective. And there, we remain very, very strong. And especially when you start to work with global workforces, it gets even more complicated and we can simplify that for customers. 
Raimo Lenschow: Okay. Congratulations. 
David Ossip: Thank you. 
Jeremy Johnson: The next question comes from Scott Berg at Needham. 
Scott Berg: I have 2 here. I guess, first of all, David, I'd like to follow up with the question -- or follow up on the question, Raimo, just asked about your upmarket activities and success. Our industry work over the last quarter has pretty consistently talked about, how the down market activity is really robust in line with pre-pandemic levels. But kind of that mid-market customers with, I don't know, a couple of thousand employees and larger to the enterprise, is a little bit more sluggish than that downmarket opportunity. I guess help us understand maybe what you're seeing there. Is your increased deal flow maybe as a result of you just getting involved with more deals with some of the partners and other areas, like you just mentioned on Raimo's question? Or do you think the actual volume of deals is truly higher today than maybe it was a year ago? 
David Ossip: So Scott, we actually haven't seen that. In fact, I think we've actually seen the reverse. And we don't really play in the small business in the U.S. So I can speak about the small business in Canada, and we have seen robust growth over there. In fact, if I look at the Powerpay numbers, they're up quite significantly versus what we had expected. When I look at global, which includes obviously the U.S. and Canada as well as Europe and APJ, we've seen tremendous sales growth in major market 2 and in the enterprise segment. And so that's both on a dollar basis and on a volume of deal basis. So it's a little bit different, I think, what we're seeing, I think, versus I think what your research is showing. 
Scott Berg: Got it. That's helpful. And then kind of a housekeeping question for Noemie. Your guidance has Ascender revenues of $4.5 million, as you mentioned, in Q3 and Q4 in the Dayforce line item. Maybe help us understand why you're guiding those revenues to be a little bit lower than what you actually realized in Q2? I know it's only $0.5 million, obviously, which isn't a big, material number. just trying to understand the dynamic by that. And then I guess the Bureau revenues are also guided a little bit less than what you saw in the quarter. 
Noemie Heuland: Yes. It's really pretty consistent. I mean we said $4.5 million per quarter, and we had in Q2 a little bit of uptick due to purchase accounting adjustments as we talked about before. So that's really -- I think the message is consistent with what we've said before, both on the cloud recurring and on Bureau as well. So what happened in Q2, you had a bit of a purchase accounting adjustments, but the rest of it is consistent with what we said before. 
David Ossip: Scott, one thing I would add is that Ascender also had a good sales quarter. So they came in really, really nicely with the Ascender products that we're still selling in market. 
Jeremy Johnson: All right. Well, that was our final question for the evening. But before we close out the call, I'll hand it over to David for some final remarks. 
David Ossip: Great. Well, thanks, everyone, really, really appreciate it. It's with mixed emotion that I'm sharing with you that, after nearly 10 years, Jeremy is leaving Ceridian. He's taken a CFO role at a very fast-growing company that's IPO-bound. From my perspective, a bit mixed. But what I would say, it's a great opportunity for a really, really great guy. And I really want to thank Jeremy because I, as you know, have really enjoyed working with Jeremy over the last number of years. 
 Jeremy's last day is August 6. And so over the past month, we transitioned his IR responsibilities to Erik Zimmer. He's someone that I know most of you are very familiar with. Erik and I have worked together for at least 10 years very, very closely. He's our EVP of Corporate Development. 
 Erik, do you want to say a few words to maybe introduce yourself? 
Erik Zimmer: Yes, sure. Thanks, David. I'll be short and sweet, but looking forward to working with all the folks that I already know that are out there and definitely looking forward to making new acquaintances and relationships and working on a new challenge. So thanks, David. 
David Ossip: I appreciate it, Erik. And Jeremy, just a huge thanks and, obviously, wishing you a tremendous success, which I'm sure you'll be very, very successful. And as you know, any organization is really lucky to get you. So just handing it back to Jeremy, any final words before we move on to the analyst calls later. 
Jeremy Johnson: No, thank you very much, and it's great working with everyone. 
David Ossip: Thanks, everyone.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-05-05 17:00:00) =====

 With that, I will turn the call over to David. 
David Ossip: Thanks, Jeremy. Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. Before we go to Q&A, I want to spend a few minutes on the key points from the quarter.
 First, we had strong financial performance in the first quarter that was meaningful beat of guidance across all metrics. Dayforce recurring revenue, excluding float revenue, grew by 21%. First quarter sales were significantly above 2019 and 2020, and we expect sales momentum to continue reflecting a strong sales pipeline and pent-up demand. Second, we are excited to say that we expect total revenue in 2021 to exceed $1 billion, a significant milestone for Ceridian.
 Looking forward to the rest of the year, in the second quarter of 2021, we expect Dayforce recurring revenue ex float to grow 28% to 29% year-over-year. And for the second half of 2021, we expect Dayforce recurring revenue, excluding float revenue, to grow above 29% compared to the second half of 2020.
 Finally, Dayforce Wallet continues to go very well, and we remain confident in the Wallet strategy. We continue to see traction in registration, and we are seeing registration rates now of over 20%. We have more than 150 customers using the Wallet, and over 450 have signed up in total. Attach rates on new sales have continued to be approximately 80%. In April, we launched Dayforce Wallet in Canada and already have more than 40 customers signed up. Throughout 2021, we'll continue to introduce new features into Dayforce Wallet to increase employee adoption and to drive Dayforce sale.
 In summary, we believe we are extremely well positioned to capture market share, extend our market leadership and drive long-term profitable growth.
 I would like to now hand it back to Jeremy to open our call for questions. 
Jeremy Johnson: Thanks, David. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Jared Levine in for Bryan Bergin of Cowen. 
Jared Levine: So in terms of Dayforce bookings, did signings accelerate over 1Q? And then if you exclude those handful of large deals that slipped into early January, would those 1Q signings still have been higher than the 2019 and 2020 levels? 
David Ossip: So Jared, the answer is yes, we had a very good first quarter. Even if we adjust for the deals that slipped out of Q4, the sales numbers would have been higher than both 2020 and 2019. 
Jared Levine: Okay. Great. And then has there been any employment recovery thus far in 2Q? And then how is kind of Canada's employment recovery compared to the U.S. thus far in fiscal year '21 or even start -- period into the beginning of the pandemic? 
David Ossip: Yes. So when we gave guidance at the end of Q4, we expected an employee headcount on the Dayforce side to be $67 million. We saw a headwind of $6 million inside the quarter. We expect that to remain the same for Q2, and then we expect to effectively see a $1 million to $2 million improvement in Q3 and Q4.
 On the Powerpay side, Jeremy and Noemie, correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that we had expected a headwind of about $3 million, when in reality, we only saw a headwind of $1.5 million. So on the Powerpay side, which is in Canada, we did see better employment numbers than we had expected. 
Jeremy Johnson: The next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. 
Sitikantha Panigrahi: It's -- looking at your $1 billion-plus revenue for 2021, that's pretty impressive. Even if I exclude Ascender, assuming $6.7 million kind of month -- per month run rate, that's almost like $90 million, $95 million above what consensus are expecting. So where do you see mostly in terms of upside? Is it -- are you seeing more on the enterprise segment? Or what's driving your confidence and -- to drive such a kind of top line growth? 
David Ossip: Well, Siti, we have very good visibility, as you know, several quarters out. So when we look at our projections for 2021 and the $1 billion number, we look at the backlog that we have already in implementation. We have a high degree of confidence in our implementation team. We know that when a project kicks off, they will go live on time and budget. And that allows us to model out the revenue line. So we have a high degree in confidence.
 And again, in Q2, we expect Dayforce recurring ex float to grow 28% to 29%, which is up quite a bit from what we had given previously. And for the remainder of the year, in the second half, we expect Dayforce recurring ex float to grow above 29%. And again, that is based largely on the sales that we already have made and the projects that are under implementation. 
Sitikantha Panigrahi: That's great color. And then a follow-up on the Wallet side. It's almost -- it's been a year since you launched last year, and 450 customers signed up and 150 already using, that's pretty impressive. Could you give us some kind of color, like what kind of usage pattern you are seeing among the customer, those who are using, whether the number of employee or kind of volume of payments that are going through? And what are the learning moments here? And how do you plan to expand the product features to see further traction there? 
David Ossip: That's a great question. So let me benchmark it to last quarter. Last quarter, we were seeing registration rates of about 16% to 18% across customers that were using the Wallet. We have now seen the registration rates go above 20%. And in customers that have been using the product the longest, we are seeing it almost at 30%, if not higher in some cases.
 In terms of the usage pattern, the typical active user uses a product about half a dozen times per month, typically loading on about $120 per time. So we're seeing quite high usage of it.
 In terms of the features that we are adding to the product, there will be 2 additional feature rollouts this year, one in June and one in the second half. In June, we're adding features for a virtual card. So you don't need to have the plastic present to do a transaction. We're adding direct deposit capability, which means I, as an employee, will be able to just, with a single click, say I'd like to stream my payroll to my Wallet at the end of every day. Currently, the user has to go to the Wallet app, say, hey, I'd like to add $100 to my Wallet. This will be completely fluid without the user having to do that. Obviously, with guardrails for the user, how much they would like to add or what they're going to do, balances and such.
 We're adding additional pay card capability, which, as you know, makes it viable for minors to use the product as well. And then we're adding some notification capabilities to the actual product as well, so nudges and such.
 In the second half of the year, we expect to launch savings for the Wallet balance. We'll have various types of referral programs. We'll be launching our reward programs, more in-app self-service, change of PIN, things like that, enhanced notifications, and we'll be starting moving to areas of financial wellness.
 So we have quite a robust road map for the actual Wallet. And as we mentioned, all of these features, we believe, will add to more adoption of the Wallet, higher usage, but also will help us in the Dayforce sales side as well. 
Noemie Heuland: The other thing I would add, David, is we've recently launched the Wallet in Canada as well. We already have over 40 customers signed up for it. 
David Ossip: Well, that's a great point, Noemie. I believe we must be one of the only, if not the only, wallet that you can use in both the U.S. and Canada. And we expect to launch in the U.K. and Ireland next year as well. 
Sitikantha Panigrahi: Just one quick clarification on my first question. So M&A contribution, Noemie, what have you baked into your guidance? 
Noemie Heuland: You're talking wallet contribution, Siti? 
Sitikantha Panigrahi: No, no, M&A, acquisitions. Acquisition revenue. 
Noemie Heuland: So if you're talking about Ascender specifically, I think we have disclosed the numbers in the stockholder letter, and we can go into detail. It's going to be pretty much the same run rate as you've seen in Q1 in the month of March. And so that's what's reflected in our guidance today. 
Jeremy Johnson: The next question comes from Dan Jester of Citi. 
Daniel Jester: David, maybe just at a high level, can you just give us an update now that Ascender just closed, kind of how do you see the strategy in Asia Pac evolving? And if I look at Ascender, I think that they sell payroll modules to customers who have other HCM software. And so as you think about, over time, converting those customers to Dayforce, how does the push and pull between sort of HCM and payroll evolve in Asia Pac? And is that going to be any different than you saw with the experience in the U.S.? 
David Ossip: Dan, let me answer the last part of your question first. We do sell, in North America and EMEA, payroll, payroll and workforce management, without the HCM components. We've done that at many of the very large customers. And in that case, often, the ERP is a system of record, and they're bringing best of breeds for some of the talent components. So I believe the same pattern will be in APJ as well.
 Now there is an upsell for customers that I'll say are in the major market segment to the small enterprise segment. And in those cases, we do believe there is a strong upsell possibility for workforce management, core HR and all the talent modules we have as well. 
 In terms of the strategy, we spoke a bit about it in the shareholder letter. Over a 4- to 5-year period, we expect to migrate the accounts over to Dayforce. The Ascender acquisition brings with it several different products. There are 2 products in Australia. One is a major market product, one is more for government, education and larger enterprises.
 On the major market product, we are already beginning our migrations. In the enterprise, education and government sector, we have to add some capabilities to the Dayforce application. Now in the rest of Asia, with the exception of Japan, we have been building, alongside the R&D team of Excelity, a Dayforce payroll factory for most of the countries across Asia. And we believe to have that online relatively soon, which will give us native capability for Dayforce across all of those geographies, and we'll be able to start the migration.
 And then in Japan, there is a separate product that Ascender has in Japan. We intend to keep that product given the uniqueness of that particular market. 
Daniel Jester: Great. And then just a follow-up on sort of building out the partner network, maybe an update as to how that's going -- how is building that out? And any impact on how you're seeing that in 2021? Or is that going to be something that maybe has an impact on the business more next year? 
David Ossip: Great. Thanks, Dan. We're very, very pleased with how it's going with the build-out of the system integrators. First, from a sales execution, our sales team has now begun to work very well with the SIs. And we have examples now, successful examples of where we have signed new contracts with SIs priming the Dayforce implementation.
 You'll see that reflected in some of the professional services numbers. So you'll see less professional services growth year-over-year as some of the SIs are now doing the implementations. And you'll see that in the way that we reflect some of the numbers. For example, the Dayforce incremental revenue and such, we'll now start to focus on recurring revenue because we expect the SIs to begin priming on that particular side.
 But in terms of number, in terms of depth of relationship, in terms of success in having the SIs primed and also success in the SIs bringing us some very, very nice deals. In fact, we recently closed a large deal in the EMEA region in, I believe, under an 8-week period that was primed by an SI and brought to us by an SI. So really great examples of the SI strategy bringing a lot of benefit. 
Jeremy Johnson: Next question comes from Mark Marcon of Baird. 
Mark Marcon: David, you -- in the shareholder letter, you mentioned a number of really impressive wins, including Fortune 100 companies in the health care space, global players. Wondering if you can just give a little bit more color with regards to the wins that you were most proud of and who you ended up winning from, and why they ended up really choosing you in terms of the decisive elements.
 And then there's also commentary with regards to the sales pipeline being very strong and that there's pent-up demand. And so I'm wondering, how would you characterize the sales pipeline today relative to pre-pandemic levels and what your expectations are as we go through the year? And then I have a question for Noemie. 
David Ossip: Sure. So on the pipeline side, as we've mentioned, the pipeline is very strong. It's definitely higher than we had pre, let's say, Q2 of 2020. I also think, when I look at the quality of the pipeline, it's a better quality of pipeline as well.
 We spoke about some of the examples around the marketing success, particularly around the virtual events. But we're now seeing effectively a close rate of about 15% of those people who attend the actual summits. And just given the breadth of how large these summits are, the large summit had, I believe, 700 attendees, and we have another summit coming up relatively quickly.
 In terms of the actual wins, it's hard to say a favorite. I don't think you're allowed to say that. All of our customers are our favorites. But there are some that I really do think that are great. If you look at the size of some of them, we called out one in particular in the shareholder letter, where we talked about a large kind of health care organization. I was quite involved with them as well. It is quite a competitive deal against the regular competitors and some of the ERPs that you'll suspect to be playing. And I believe the way that we explained the value proposition as to where we could really create quantifiable value to the customer worked very nice. And again, it was a deal where we were supported by a large SI. 
Mark Marcon: Great. And then can you talk a little bit about -- on the Wallet, has there been any pushback from any client, anyone that's installed it and said, you know what, this has become too hard or too difficult? And if so, what percentage of the time are you seeing that? 
David Ossip: So Mark, this has got to be one of the easiest things to implement at a client. You literally check a few check boxes. And the employees download the app off the Google Play or the iOS store. It does the [ initial ] customer piece by pulling the information directly from the Dayforce application. So there's a fewer okays that you have to do. And then you get your plastic in the mail just a few days later.
 In fact, when we launched in Canada, I was one of the first users to use the app, and it is really easy to use. So we don't get any pushback from the customers in that this is too difficult to do. From a payroll administration piece as well, it doesn't complicate the process. There's no reconciliation that the payroll team has to do. They don't have to change the way that they do the funding. It's not a bolt-on system. It's just embedded with inside the application. We've had tremendous feedback from the customers that are using the Wallet in terms of ease-of-use benefit to their employees. And we've got a whole bunch of case studies where employees have written to us talking about the benefit from a financial well-being perspective.
 So we remain very, very confident. I believe the direct deposit and the streaming of pay feature that will launch in the June release is going to be very, very well accepted. 
Mark Marcon: Excellent. And then, Noemie, can you just talk a little bit about the EBITDA guidance for the second quarter? Just what are some of the puts and takes? And what are -- what's kind of temporary and transitionary? 
Noemie Heuland: Yes. I think -- so on the margin, as we've mentioned before, we are clearly in an investment year. As you know, we're making significant investments in our product and technology group, especially around the Wallet, around the build of global capabilities in Germany and in other places. So that's why you're going to see translating into higher product and technology spend as a percentage of revenue as well as a higher cash spend on R&D, which is something we're doing consciously in order to gain some market share.
 And we're seeing also some increased spend in sales and marketing. As we are expanding our capabilities with large enterprise customer sellers, we're building the SI partnerships and so on. So that translates into a higher sales and marketing that we are also -- you're going to see also throughout the year. So that's why we've provided guidance for the full year adjusted EBITDA margin around 15% to 16% of revenue. 
Jeremy Johnson: Next question comes from Matt Coss, who's in for Mark Murphy at JPMorgan. 
Matthew Coss: Congrats on the strong quarter, guys. Can you just help me understand the net dollar retention you're seeing now versus a year ago? I know you usually just report gross retention once a year, but is the net dollar retention something you've seen improve since last year? 
David Ossip: It remains very strong. It's above 105%, maybe 106%, which hasn't really changed, I would say, over the years. What's remarkable is that it remained at that level even with lower employment numbers at our customers. 
Matthew Coss: Got it. Okay. And then has the pandemic changed the priority of HCM relative to other IT purchasing? In other words, is modern HCM viewed as more critical now than it was a year ago relative to other software applications? And have you seen that sort of come through in pipeline and sales forecasts? 
David Ossip: Yes. So Matt, look, I think there's been a benefit to demand across the pandemic. And it's gone in phases. In the first phase, I think a lot of the companies who are still relying on paper forms, paper manual processes or had on-prem systems were in a mad rush to get into the cloud and to digitize all of the interactions with their employees. And that has continued to drive demand.
 What we're finding now is that when I call out and I speak to customers, and I speak to probably about 20 customers per week, what I'm finding across the C-level is that there is a real concern that with people having been working at home for over a year, that it is becoming more difficult to maintain the culture and the bonding at an organization. And so a lot of organizations are looking for products like us that can really help communicate and bring employees together so that you can maintain and strengthen culture and obviously keep engagement levels very high.
 In the shareholder letter, I spoke about how we -- or how I've been describing how we've used the application. Firstly, we used the hub that we recently launched. And we did that because we revised our values. We removed 1, added 2, and so we used that as a way of communicating the new values to our employee group with embedded training on all the different values, embedded videos and such.
 Second, we've been using the DEI dashboard from an ESG perspective, and that's been very, very helpful for me to actually see trends and to make sure we're moving in the right direction to make sure that we have proper diversity and balance inside our executive team, and it's gone very, very nicely. We've been using the engagement features to keep a score on track on what our eNPS levels have been, making sure that we're addressing important items for the employees.
 And lastly, the Dayforce Wallet really has given our employees much better financial flexibility and wellness. And those are the things that people are looking for because when you bring it together, that keeps the company together, and in times like this, this is very important. And I believe those are the reasons that we've seen such a strong demand for our product. 
Jeremy Johnson: Next question comes from Samad Samana of Jefferies. 
Samad Samana: So maybe first one, David, the pace of M&A seems to be picking up for the company. It seems to be more concentrated in the APAC region. Just maybe how should we think about -- is there a structural change in maybe how M&A is thought of as a lever for growth? And then again, on a regional level, should we think about it just happens to be in APAC right now? Or should we see it be more balanced maybe going forward? And then I have a couple of follow-ups. 
David Ossip: Sure. So first of all, I can say I'm very proud of our M&A capability. I think we've built it, strengthened it, and we've been able to execute on a number of transactions. And I already gave kudos to our M&A team headed up by, as you know, Erik Zimmer. He's done a really, really great job.
 When it comes to M&A strategy, as you know, we are focused on the regional consolidation play. And I've spoken about that before. There are many companies out there that are in particular jurisdictions that have legacy technology, typically focused only on the payroll side, great opportunity for us to acquire a nice multiple, use the knowledge, their people, their operations to really build out that capability quickly inside Dayforce and then, over time, look at migrating their customers onto the Dayforce platform, and we get tremendous benefit elsewhere in the world by having that capability in that particular region.
 We spoke about that on the last shareholder letter, how we were seeing pickup in global sales because of our APJ capability, and that's continued. We are looking at other regions around the world now. And I would expect that we'll do some transactions like that over the next couple of years.
 The other area of M&A where we've been quite active, and you see this with the Ideal acquisition, which I've got to say is really a great piece of software, the team is exceptionally strong. We're talking about a big group of data scientists with very deep knowledge in terms of talent and talent acquisition. We had been partnering with them on the Dayforce side for over a 2-year period, already had embedded it inside the product. So we knew what the product could actually do.
 But we are looking for acquisitions like that as well, where you acquire a specific type of capability that allows us to leverage that capability inside the Dayforce product to get more of an advantage relative to our competitors. Another example where you saw that was on the benefits side, Clearview Logix. We acquired them several years ago. That gave us the benefit decision support, the benefit intelligence piece, also which has gone really, really nicely in market. So yes, I do think M&A of those 2 different flavors will be a part of our future. 
Samad Samana: Great. And then maybe, Noemie, a follow-up for you on just the revenue categorization. Saw where the dollar buckets are put in, in the shareholder letter, but just maybe most of the acquisitions in the past have been fully allocated to Bureau. Just trying to understand maybe why some of Ascender went into the Dayforce bucket at the outset since, usually, it's the acquire and convert mechanism. So maybe just -- I think it would be helpful to understand that. 
Noemie Heuland: Yes. You're right. The majority of it went to Bureau, but there's a portion of the Ascender solutions that is a pure cloud solution. David referred to the Japanese cloud platform. There's also a part of the Asia Pacific solutions that is under cloud that we're going to continue to support and then build upon -- build the Dayforce user interface on top of it and continue to sell as well as upsell some of the HCM modules to that population. So that's the PCC in-cloud revenue, which is about $1.5 million to $2 million, including services per month. 
Samad Samana: Great. And just one last one for you, David. With the new hiring -- with the hire of the new Chief Revenue Officer, bringing Rocky on, should we expect any changes to the sales organization or go-to-market model underneath that, that -- any major changes that we should anticipate with the change in leadership there? 
David Ossip: Look, Samad, as you know, over the last -- for 3 years now, we've been investing heavily in really superstars from a talent perspective. Rocky falls into that, really a tremendous background. As you know, most recently, he ran one of the ERP's largest regions. He had complete P&L responsibility. So he's really a true powerhouse that we bring into the actual organization.
 I think we've already had a lot of change with inside the sales organization in terms of segments, in terms of moving to enterprise, in terms of kind of really empowering SI relationships and such. And now I think Rocky's real goal is to maintain that focus with inside the organization and make sure that we execute even better, and really to focus on making sure that we have a great culture inside the sales organization as well. So I don't expect to see massive changes inside to go to a market. What I'm expecting to see is continued great execution in our go-to-market. 
Jeremy Johnson: Next question comes from Chris Merwin at Goldman Sachs. 
Christopher Merwin: Great. I wanted to ask one about the Wallet. I was just curious if there's any other features you're thinking about adding to that core product where you could further monetize the funds running through the Wallet. Or alternatively, are there other partners you could add, Cash App or Venmo, to give users more flexibility about where those funds may ultimately sit? Just curious, anything you can share about the product road map or thoughts about where that product could evolve to in time? 
David Ossip: Yes, Chris, you'll see some of that already happening in the second half release of the actual product. So when we talk about rewards, so we'll do the rewards through one of the -- obviously, the programs out there. There are probably 2 big players in the U.S. With that, there is a revenue share. It's the way that the model works, is that the cardholder, based on BIN number, does get a cash back. And as well, the merchant pays the network a fee for the actual purchase, and we will probably get -- well, we do, we get a split of that with the actual partner.
 We'll probably also have partnerships for bill pay and as well for kind of click switch that you go to Amazon or Netflix, making it very, very easy with a simple click to use the -- enter in your Dayforce card as a source of payment. So I would expect to get that.
 In terms of where the people can keep their money, yes, we'll start off with savings, the interest-based savings accounts where the cardholder can select which bank they would like the money to be held at and the interest that they'd like to get on that. And then over time, we'll get into more financial wellness types of products as well. 
Jeremy Johnson: Next question comes from Scott Berg at Needham. 
Scott Berg: David, I just wanted to kind of follow up on the Ascender questions a little bit. As you've had the acquisition for a whopping a couple of months now so far, how do you think about the growth rate opportunity, and whether it's Australia or Asia Pac, relative to Ceridian as a whole? 
David Ossip: So Scott, it will take us a bit of time to get going. So we're in the early days of the integration. But in terms of opportunity, we know that the APJ market is growing quicker than the rest of the world. So I would expect a growth opportunity over there to be at least equal to the rest of Ceridian on a go-forward basis. 
Scott Berg: Got it. And I know you mentioned the new staff, 80% attach rates of Wallet to your new customers, which is obviously a fantastic attach rate. But as you look at the rest of the portfolio of solutions, how would you compare attach rates for the other talent management modules today versus maybe the pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter of '19? 
David Ossip: We've seen the attach rate go up. If I look at the add-ons in Q1, I believe we're at -- Jeremy, Noemie, I think it's 28% number that it came in at, and pre-pandemic, we probably were at the 20% level. 
Scott Berg: Excellent. And last quick one for me is I know you talked about 20% of registrations on Wallet as customers ramp up and you've seen one -- or a handful at 30%. What does that number look like do you think at kind of peak levels? Is it 40% to 50% of the employee base? Or do you think it can maybe be higher than that number? 
David Ossip: So look, we talk about the future. What I can say is we've seen it go up quarter-over-quarter, and we are seeing customers above that 30%. If -- the only real market study out there would be the one at Walmart where I believe their registration rate has doubled year-over-year, and I believe they are close to the 50% range. So I would think that would be a reasonable range once we get the -- kind of all the Wallet features put into the actual system. And now with us, it might be higher because we don't have a charge. We don't charge the [ Wallet users ] a fee for usage, whereas, I believe, in the case of Walmart, they might. 
Jeremy Johnson: Next question comes from Alex Zukin at Wolfe. 
Aleksandr Zukin: Congratulations on the quarter. So if we zoom out, David, and we look at this year, kind of ex COVID, you're going in with a great pipeline. You're kind of -- you've successfully switched for new customers to [ peppen up ] provisioning. You've got really exciting partners that are signed up. And you have differentiated technology on a global payroll perspective, where at least our checks indicate you're winning deals against other HCM vendors as a result of that functionality.
 So stepping back, if I think about the kind of growth execution that you're looking to put up, you've given guidance, is there -- a lot of things have kind of fallen into place, not to mention you've also hired another rock star Head of Sales. How should we think about the durability of growth exiting COVID? You guided, I know, this year, but longer term, bigger picture, what's the right way to level set kind of the opportunity set that you've kind of put in front of you here? 
David Ossip: Alex, as you know, we've been quite consistent with our growth levers since we IPOed. One, we acquired new customers, around 500 to 600 per year. Two, we build out additional capability. We go back to the base. We sell them additional modules. I spoke about the 28% add-ons that we're now seeing. Third, we move up into the enterprise space. And you've seen that. If you read through the shareholder letter, you'll see some great examples of some very large organizations.
 Four, we move on a global basis. And I think our execution in UKI has been wonderful. If I look at the deals that we're signing in the EMEA region, they already are tremendous, and we're only 2 years out of the gate there. The moves that we're making now in APJ obviously support that as well. And I expect we'll make similar types of moves elsewhere in the world. And so that's going very, very nicely. And then we've always spoken about adjacent products like the Wallet, which allows us to drive more recurring revenue from the people who use our systems.
 Now in order to do that, we have to obviously invest quite heavily in talent. If you look at the people that we brought on, people like Noemie, people like Rocky, people like Leagh, people like Joe, all of the individuals that we have brought in have experience at scale and they have experience on a global basis. And that gives us the confidence that we can execute against those 5 different growth levers, and I think we have.
 I'm also very proud of how resilient Ceridian was over the time of the pandemic. We spoke about leaning into the pandemic and coming out even stronger, and I think that is the case. 
Aleksandr Zukin: Perfect. And then if I think about kind of hiring trends and hiring trajectory, not so much employment levels but your own direct sales organization, I don't know -- apologies if you've commented on this or this has been asked, but what should we be thinking about in terms of just go-to-market team hiring for this year and getting ready for next year as it compares to either -- pre-pandemic levels? 
David Ossip: I think in our guidance numbers, I mean, which you will find embedded in the EBITDA number as well are the investments that we're making in sales and marketing. I don't think you're going to see massive hiring. We'll continue at the hiring levels that we've made over the last year. We never really slowed down on the hiring side on sales and marketing. And so we'll continue to make those investments.
 Jeremy or Noemie, anything you want to add specifically around sales and marketing investments? 
Noemie Heuland: No, I think that's right. We're continuing to invest, and we're upskilling certain departments to be able to tackle the large enterprise segments. Historically, we've been more focused on majors, and we're actually building capabilities to go after the larger enterprise segment, and we're also building capabilities to work with SIs. And so those are the other areas where we're investing as well in sales and marketing. 
Jeremy Johnson: Next question comes from Arvind Ramnani from Piper Sandler. 
Arvind Ramnani: I just wanted to circle back on digital wallet. You have indicated that it has an impact on employee retention rates for some of your clients. And with that, has that improved your win rates just given that you're able to kind of prove that if you use Ceridian and digital wallet, retention rates can go up? And also just as a follow-up to that, are there any specific industries where you're seeing elevated traction for digital wallet? 
David Ossip: Great. So there are 2 great questions over there. Without a doubt, having the Wallet has helped our win rate, and there probably are 2 reasons for that. The first is we always speak about that we're differentiated in market in that we have a continuous calc engine, which means that when you change a timesheet, an HR record, a benefit record, we immediately calculate the net earnings. The Wallet leverages that capability. And so when we talk about being able to offer the Wallet, it also clearly explains to the customer the advantage of having a continuous calc engine which the others don't have. And so I do think it has helped us tremendously.
 Second, when we speak to the HR team and we speak about talent and about how we can improve the engagement, deliver benefit and also improve their ability to attract new people into the organization, we have some tremendous stats coming from the Wallet. And we spoke about them last time, that we found that when we look at active cardholders versus nonactive cardholders in the same companies, the voluntary attrition rate goes down by 42%. And when we talk about the speed of filling an open job vacancy, we see that improving by about 10%. And those are really, really great numbers.
 In terms of industries, I can actually just look at it right here, look at it kind of live for you. And so if I look at my kind of industry dashboard over here, we're seeing kind of success right across industries, with peak at the moment in retail, professional services, manufacturing, financial services and construction. 
Arvind Ramnani: Great. That's so helpful. And just kind of a separate question for me on the competitive environment. Some of the legacy players have continued to innovate. And with that, I mean Ceridian also has continued to innovate. And also from a -- I guess from a demand environment, 2020 certainly has accelerated demand for kind of cloud-based solutions.
 So just with the backdrop of like the demand environment, which is probably looking for more cloud solutions and some of the legacy players continue to innovate, are you kind of satisfied with kind of the distance you have from an offering perspective relative to the competition? Or you feel like some of the legacy players are sort of starting to catch up? 
David Ossip: In terms of the legacy players, I don't know if there is much catch-up happening, would be the way that I probably would describe it. There are a number of aspects that I do think we're differentiated. As you know, from a product side, we have the features like the continuous calc engine. We have the single database, the single-rule engine, we have the Dayforce Wallet. We make very effective use of AI and ML. We have the global capabilities. We're strongest, I believe, in compliance, and kind of noted by Gartner and others.
 The second area where I do think we're differentiated are in our service levels. And if I look at the client satisfaction scores as measured by NPS in implementation, or if I look at when they go live, I do believe our NPS scores are probably best inside market. And those 2 things combined, really a great client experience with leading technology.
 We're also not stagnant on the technology. If you look at the work that Joe is doing, remember Joe is our Chief Product and Technology Officer, the work that he's doing over there in terms of user experience, really, a focus on data and the intelligence, so the use of AI and ML, some of the lift that we're doing to the various talent modules at the moment and also the work that we're doing in terms of interoperability, really have -- I think are best-in-class. 
Jeremy Johnson: Next question comes from Brad Clark with BMO. 
Bradley Clark: I just want to ask about the international strategy in EMEA. And specifically, with Germany payroll rolling out this year, how do you think about the strategy over the next year taking advantage of that payroll launch around Germany and building out the EMEA customer base? And additionally, how should we think about how that translates into what you guys refer to as those global deals and global customer wins? 
David Ossip: So Brad, we're already very happy with the traction that we're having in EMEA. We launched in UKI several years ago, and we're seeing great wins inside the market, and not only wins in terms of sales but in go-lives and referenceability. We've also had tremendous success inside Germany with our workforce management product. Great customers like Siemens globally, Henkel, Kessler, Lidl, Coghlan, all of them are leading organizations in Germany and across EMEA as well.
 In terms of the build-out of Germany, that will be ready in 2022. We already have developers and operational people and salespeople on the ground in Germany. Once we have Germany up and running, obviously, we're going to expand very quickly to the jurisdictions that are surrounding Germany or do a lot of work with kind of Germany. And so we believe that we will be a leader in that region as well. 
Jeremy Johnson: Our next question comes from David Robinson at William Blair. 
David Robinson: So you kind of touched on this previously with regards to the kind of increasing attach rates of certain modules this quarter compared to the past. I was wondering, have you seen any increase in kind of certain areas as companies are anticipating reopening, both in the North America and kind of in the other different regions around the world? Just trying to see if there's any interest around maybe the recruiting or onboarding modules or how that's been trending. 
David Ossip: So David, I think you're right. So there are a few things with us. There's a lot of focus now on employee communications. We launched the Dayforce Hub recently, and what that is, it's effectively a homepage that a customer can tailor based on jurisdiction, type of employee, I think put their branding on it, they can make it look and feel a really meet their own personality.
 You can have deep linking inside our application or deep linking to external applications as well. You can have time-sensitive content and action items for the people. And that's obviously to be a central communication hub, which is very powerful. As I mentioned, we used them internally to relaunch our values and very successfully.
 Second, on the recruiting side, we're obviously seeing a lot on talent acquisition. Now on the talent acquisition, we just acquired Ideal. And what Ideal really has is that they have AI that is used for grading of the candidates who apply. And it's a true machine learning algorithm, which means that if a hiring manager or a recruiter doesn't agree with the grade, they can correct and the system learns based on behavior.
 They also have great capability from a DEI perspective. So when you're actually going through the candidates, you're making sure that you don't have any type of bias across the hiring managers, and we believe we can use that capability as well in areas like performance management and the like.
 We're very, very strong on employee onboarding. And when I talk about employee onboarding, the single application becomes very powerful because you normally start off with a landing page. We have a message from the CEO, it's a multimedia. You then go into the sign-offs and instead of just saying, hey, have you read the code, the company ethics or behavior or privacy, you now embed learning directly into that experience. You take the course and then it signs you off. You have the various checklists, the various forms that can now be completed digitally, which obviously help tremendously.
 We then typically bring in benefit enrollment. So we go through the benefit decision support to make it a really pleasing experience. You typically bring in a bit more learning management. So you have on-the-job training, set up the person's 30-day, 60-day, 90-day development plans and the like. And so it's very -- it works very, very nicely.
 Now the same onboarding modules use what we call transporting. So you can think about people returning to work and putting together a proper experience when people will be coming back to offices that don't look the same that they were before the COVID pandemic. So obviously, a big uptick in that as well.
 We also are doing quite nicely on areas like engagement. As I mentioned before, it's a top concern for any CEO, making sure that engagement levels are holding while people are at home, ability to do poll surveys, full engagement surveys, leveraging again a lot of intelligence features like sentiment analysis to read through the comments so that you can make sure that any comments that aren't positive are dealt with correctly. So obviously, quite a lot.
 Also what is another area is on the global side. In today's work-from-home using tools like Zoom and such, where someone sits is no longer as important as it was prior to the pandemic. And so the ability to have global payroll capability, being able to do things like compensation management, either in a constant currency or in a local currency, from a budgeting perspective, it becomes very, very important, but also to handle how do you pay people, they're in Brazil or they're in Portugal or if they're in the U.S., Canada, in a single system. All of those seem to be driving the add-ons. 
Jeremy Johnson: Great. Well, we actually have no more questions in the queue. And such, that concludes the call today. I would like to thank everyone for joining us this evening, and we look forward to touching base with you in the future. 
David Ossip: Great. Thank you, everyone. See you guys later this evening. Bye-bye.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-09 17:00:00) =====
Jeremy Johnson: Greetings. My name is Jeremy Dobson, Head of FP&A and Investor Relations at Ceridian. I'd like to welcome everyone to the Ceridian Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. 
 On the call today, we have Ceridian's CEO, David Ossip; and CFO, Noemie Heuland. 
 Before I hand the call to David for some brief remarks, allow me to provide a disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements. This call may include forward-looking statements about our current and future outlook, guidance, plans, expectations and intentions, results, levels of activities, performance, goals or achievements, or any other future events or developments. These statements are based on management's reasonable assumptions and beliefs in light of information currently available to us. Listeners are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements. Each forward-looking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements.

We undertake no obligation to update or to revise any forward-looking statements made on this call, except as may be required by law. 
 The fourth quarter stockholder letter and earnings release have been furnished with the SEC and will be available on the SEC's EDGAR database in the U.S. and the SEDAR database in Canada as well as on the Ceridian Investor Relations website at investors.ceridian.com. 
 With that, I'll turn the call over to David. David, you're on now. 
David Ossip: Thanks, Jeremy. Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining our earnings call. I hope everyone is healthy and staying safe. 
 Before we go to Q&A, I want to spend a few minutes on some important points from our stockholder letter. First, we had a strong quarter. We delivered fourth quarter revenue results, which were above the high end of our guidance range. 
 Dayforce recurring revenue, excluding float revenue, grew by more than 19% despite COVID-19 headwinds remaining elevated. Also, we delivered on our adjusted EBITDA guidance while accelerating the pace of our investments in product and technology and sales and marketing. Cloud recurring gross margin increased by 210 basis points to 70.9%, and excluding float revenue, expanded by 380 basis points. 
 Second, on the sales side, we did see an impact from the second wave of COVID-19 in the form of elongated sales cycles for several large enterprise opportunities, which closed in January instead of December. While fourth quarter sales were below previous expectations, when factored together with January's closing of those transactions, sales performance was in line with last year, which was the strongest quarter in our history. Our sales pipeline is very strong. And we believe by the second half of 2021, our Dayforce recurring revenue growth rates, excluding float revenue, will return to pre-COVID-19 levels above 25%. 
 Third, Dayforce Wallet continues to go very well, and we remain confident in the wallet strategy. We continued to see strong traction in adoption. More than 100 customers are using the wallet and over 375 have signed up in total. Attach rates on new sales have continued to be above 80%. In addition, data from our early adopters is proving our thesis that the wallet can have a positive impact on our customers' businesses. Wallet customers are seeing a 5% increase in recruiting close rates, a 9% reduction in the time it takes to fill an open position as compared to our broader group of customers. Additionally, wallet customers experienced 42% lower voluntary turnover among employees using the wallet. These metrics will continue to strengthen and validate the value proposition of the wallet, creating quantifiable value for our customers and their employees. 
 Finally, we are very excited about the acquisition of Ascender. Ascender provides payroll for more than 1,200 customers, serving more than 1.3 million employees across APJ. Combined, we will serve over 1,500 customers and 2.5 million employees in the region. This positions us as the dominant contender in APJ, one of the fastest-growing regions and provides a significant cross-sell opportunity for Dayforce. We expect the acquisition to close in the second quarter, and we'll provide greater clarity to the financial implications of the acquisition at that time. 
 I would like to now hand it back to Jeremy to open the call up for questions. Thank you. 
Jeremy Johnson: Thanks, David. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from the line of Mark Murphy, JPMorgan. Mark doesn't seem -- Mark, are you on? We'll move on. The next question we're going to go to is Mark Marcon of Baird. 
Mark Marcon: Wondering if you can talk a little bit more about the impact with regards to the sales in this quarter and what spilled over into January. And should we anticipate that the first quarter sales numbers are going to end up being elevated because of what was -- what fell into this quarter? How should we think about that? 
David Ossip: Yes. Mark, it was a handful of very large accounts that closed in early January as opposed to late December. What I'd say is that the customers were less reluctant to call executives back to just do the T's and C's. So in all cases, we're in the final stages of contracts, normally black line just waiting for final signatures, and they spill over into January.
 In terms of revenue impact, obviously, it's minimal because, as you know, we typically recognize revenue on the whole when the customers go live. In terms of January, we're optimistic about the actual quarter. We had a strong January, obviously, given the spillover from December, and the pipeline still remains very strong. 
Mark Marcon: Great. And can you talk a little bit about just the pipeline? We're hearing some chatter from some systems integrators saying that there's a greater number of really large enterprises that are looking at digitizing their CM processes to an even greater extent than they were previously. Are you seeing that? And how do you think that unfolds over the course of the year? 
David Ossip: So it's an interesting question to ask. Remember that we've been moving up into the large enterprise space over the last 18 months. So it's hard to differentiate if there are more opportunities out there or it's just us being more relevant in the large enterprise space. 
Mark Marcon: That being said, David, can you just say how many more opportunities you're seeing relative to what you would have expected or anything along those lines? 
David Ossip: Mark, it's hard to really again differentiate. Obviously, we are seeing more opportunities. I don't know what it is, as you said, more large enterprises looking at digitizing their HR processes or was just that we are a proper contender. And there are a lot of data points in there. Obviously, we had many more large deals last year. We were included in the Gartner leadership quadrant, which obviously makes us much more relevant for that particular enterprise space as well. Our global offering has strengthened as well year-over-year, and most of those large opportunities do have a global component. So we are seeing more large enterprise deals, but I can't tell you if it is from more opportunities in market or just us being included in more opportunities. 
Jeremy Johnson: The next question comes from Siti Panigrahi at Mizuho. 
Sitikantha Panigrahi: Yes. Yes. Just in terms of your guidance, I know you didn't give the full guidance for Dayforce recurring revenue, 22%, Q2, and second half, 25%. So David, what's your adjunction in terms of unemployment rate in 2021? And in that guidance, how much of conservatism is baked into new sales versus unemployment level within your install base? 
David Ossip: Well, about 25% of our sales is add-ons to the base, and those add-ons, say, 2 formed either additional populations, normally from their global employees or from buying new modules. So the majority of our growth obviously comes from the acquisition of new customers in market. 
 In terms of the growth rate, remember, it's very consistent with what we said last quarter. We said that we would expect to see the recovery in the second half of 2021 given that we saw sales recovery starting in about Q3 of last year. 
Sitikantha Panigrahi: Okay. And then wanted to follow up on the international opportunity. Last year, you talked about 20 -- expanding into 20 countries, and now you mentioned about 50 countries. That seems like for me aggressive international expansion. So what sort of revenue contribution now you have? And how should we think about the international revenue contribution going forward? 
David Ossip: So Siti, as we move up market in the enterprise space, we obviously see many more global opportunities. The acquisition that we did of Excelity last year had a very positive impact in helping us with global opportunities. So we did see a lift, if you like, in win rates, especially with organizations that have populations in APJ. 
 Our upcoming acquisition of Ascender obviously will strengthen us in that regard as well, but we also have continued building out major capabilities into Germany. The UKI region has done tremendously well over the last year. So we remain very optimistic on the global side. 
Jeremy Johnson: Next question comes from Samad Samana, Jefferies. 
Samad Samana: So David, as always, we appreciate all the thoughtful remarks in the shareholder letter. That's always very helpful, especially when there's this much uncertainty. So thank you for that. But maybe in the remarks, you talked about returning to pre-COVID growth levels. And so I just wanted to triangulate maybe a little bit further on that. Does that mean that you think that the growth for Dayforce recurring ex-float, we'll get back to that 30% plus type of level that we saw in 2019 and 1Q of '20 before COVID hit? I'm not trying to pin you down on the timing of when that happens. I don't think any of us know, but is that you saying that 30% is achievable as a recurring level? 
David Ossip: So Samad, I don't want to put a number out outside of guidance, but what I will say is we've given a guidance number that we feel quite comfortable with. There's still a bit of uncertainty around the impacts of COVID. 
 For example, if I look at Q4 that we just passed, we had expected to see about a $2 million recovery in terms of employment levels. So the impact from higher employment increasing our revenue by about $2 million. In reality, we only saw about $0.5 million recovery. And so it all depends really on what goes on at the employment levels as we move into the second half of 2021. If we see the recovery kind of solidify, then I think we can be a little bit more aggressive in looking at the growth rates in the second half of the year. 
Samad Samana: Great. And then as my follow-up, I'd like to maybe add on to Siti's question around the international side, clearly, with the 3 acquisitions over the last couple of years. I'm curious if you could give us any data or at least anecdotal data points on how the uplift has looked for customers that were using Excelity that have added on Dayforce products or RITEQ? And just so we can start to think about what that -- the long-term opportunity looks like. So if they were spending x dollars before, what's that revenue uplift or sales uplift look like when you've sold in your Dayforce products into their base? 
David Ossip: I don't think we've disclosed the uplift number on the upsells to RITEQ and to Excelity, but we obviously do expect a significant cross-sell opportunity. So if I look at the Ascender opportunity, and I'll break it down, 1,200 additional customers, most of them actually are quite nice in enterprise size. That provides a significant opportunity for us to obviously migrate to Dayforce, and Ascender effectively does payroll. So we should be able to add on workforce management and all of the various talent components as well. So we're quite excited about the opportunity over there. 
 One other point about Ascender is when you combine Ascender with Excelity, we're at about 1,500 customers, about 2.5 million employees paid, and we believe that positions us as the dominant leader in the APJ region, which is the fastest-growing region for human capital management. So again, a very good data point and other reason for optimism. 
Jeremy Johnson: Our next question is going to come from the line of Michael Turrin. 
Michael Turrin: Going back to just the questions on the shape of Dayforce. I think we're all just recalibrating and can appreciate the moving pieces there. Last quarter, you were guiding for what looks like a slight acceleration into Q1. It looks like Q4 actually came in a touch ahead of maybe where we were modeling, but the Q1 outlook now implies maybe a slight step down before you move back up towards that 25% target in the second half. So I know David mentioned some of the enterprise impacts, and there are some good details in the letter. But can you just help with level setting if there's anything else driving that change in trajectory and maybe just touch on also how much visibility you have into that second half target level? 
David Ossip: So we're obviously going to the year with very good visibility. In terms of Q1, you're right, we outperformed in Q4. And if employment levels have improved the level that we had expected, you probably would have seen another about $1 million to $2 million of revenue on the Dayforce side. However, the employment levels haven't recovered to levels that we had expected when we did the Q3 call. And so we're taking that into account when we look at the Q1 guidance. 
 Noemie and Jeremy, anything else that you would add to that? 
Noemie Heuland: No. I think that's a good summary. I think the other thing I would point out is the -- on the professional services side and implementation, we've seen a pretty steady pace of go-live in Q4. And I think that, that may have shifted some of the revenue expected from that Q1 to Q4. But really beyond that, I think David covered it all. 
Michael Turrin: That's helpful color. If I can squeeze in just a quick follow-up on wallet. The numbers keep moving up. It's now 100 customers using it, and 375 signed up. That's a pretty big sequential step-up from the 200 last quarter. Are those -- some of those stats that you laid out, are those at all helping with adoption and traction? It would seem that some of those metrics around things like retention and turnover in this environment could certainly help with adoption on something like wallet. 
David Ossip: So a few things on wallet. The actual numbers are slightly higher. I think it's actually about 122 customers that are live on wallet, and 399 customers have signed up. So obviously, we're still seeing rapid, if you like, adoption of the actual wallet. 
 Obviously, yes. So as we see the economy moving to recovery, probably starting in the second half of the year, we expect that focus will be on talent acquisition. And the fact that wallet significantly improves the time that it takes to find people, the time that it takes to actually -- the probability of closing helps a lot, and also the fact that it reduces voluntary turnover across wallet users is obviously a big selling point, but not only for wallet, but actually for Dayforce as well. 
Jeremy Johnson: The next question comes from the line of Dan Jester. 
Daniel Jester: Great. So sticking with wallet, we've seen a couple of stories about state and local authorities looking to potentially put some additional regulations around earned wage access and limit some of the fees. Is that something that you're hearing? And does that have any impact on how you think about rolling out wallet from here? 
David Ossip: So Dan, I appreciate your question, but that's actually how we differentiate in markets. We don't charge the employees any fees. So if you compare our wallet to some of the third-party wallet in markets, they charge a certain amount per month per active wallet holder or cardholder. We don't do that. We don't charge any direct fees for usage of the wallet. So there's no fees to loan money in. There's no fees to effectively spend on the actual wallet either. And so we had expected that. 
 And our belief is that in the longer term, this construct of a pay period, which, as you know, weekly, biweekly, in some cases, even monthly, no makes -- no longer makes any sense. People should have access to their earned wages as they earn it. 
Daniel Jester: Great. And then just maybe turning to margins and sort of the comments around 2021. Can you help us think about the sort of the puts and takes between sort of the step-up investment and the fact that float revenue is going to be lower? Would margins excluding float, could they go higher in 2021? Or did the investments offset that? 
David Ossip: So from a margin perspective, the metric we look at most is our gross profit on recurring revenue on Cloud. As you know, that went up by 200 basis points or 380 basis points ex-float in Q4. We would expect to see that metric continue to grow into 2021. 
 In terms of EBITDA margins, it's another year that we do have headwinds. If we do look at it -- if I look at just Q4 alone relative to the prior Q4, the impact of employees and employment levels was about $9.5 million as compared to Q4 of 2019, and we had a float headwind of about $7 million compared to 2019. 
 When we look at Q1, we go in again with headwinds from the employment side. I believe Jeremy, correct me, or Noemie correct me if I'm wrong, of about $6.5 million. 
Noemie Heuland: Yes. 
David Ossip: And from a float perspective, I think we actually go in at least, from a Q1 perspective, of about a $9 million total of float headwind. If you divide it out between Dayforce and Powerpay, it's about 6 and 3, respectively. 
 Now obviously, as we start to get into Q2, Q3, Q4, on a normalized basis, it becomes a little bit more even because we are operating in 2 COVID years. 
Noemie Heuland: Yes. And maybe if I can add to the color on margins and some of the investments we're making. I think we're looking beyond 2021. As David mentioned earlier, there's a lot of opportunities with customers globally as well as customers in the market, and we're definitely investing in our product capabilities to support those customers. And we're also investing in sales and marketing to go after that massive TAM that we haven't yet tackled. So I think that's really important. We're making conscious decisions to invest to fuel the growth of Dayforce recurring in the future because that's really where we're betting, but I think we're also managing on the G&A side very cautiously to get scale. 
 So I think the combination of both, you'll see some improvements towards the back of 2021 and more in 2020. But that's important to really focus on addressing the growth that we have and then looking at the global opportunities and the expansion of the product capabilities. I think that's critical for we want to understand. 
Jeremy Johnson: Next question is going to come from Bryan Bergin at Cowen. 
Bryan Bergin: All right. I wanted to start with Ascender. David, can you talk about the strategy with this one as far as whether it was really targeted for the in-country expertise and to migrate the clients over to Dayforce versus -- also the attractive technology that you'll layer into? And also, it seems like it's a larger deal than your other recent transactions. I'm curious if this is a one-off or if this is a signal you're going to be at market for bigger transactions. 
David Ossip: Let me start with why Ascender. So if I look at the Ascender 1,200 customer base and employee base, the majority actually is in Australia. In Australia, they actually have 2 products. One of the product is in education and in government, which are new verticals for us in market. They have an exceptionally strong team when it comes to domain knowledge around payroll, which will help us significantly in the A&D space because, as you know, one of our constraints always for growth is just having great people around who can help implement and support our products. 
 The plan for Ascender is no different than what we've spoken about historically that the technology stack is largely dated as compared to Dayforce. And so over a period of time, it provides a movement opportunity towards Dayforce. And as we do that, we would expect also to have the ability to upsell them on time and attendance, workforce management, talent acquisition, performance, comp, engagement and the like. So tremendous cross-sell ability. 
 The other point about Ascender is when we combine it, as I mentioned, with Excelity, we do become the dominant player in the APJ region. And if I look at the APJ region, it's probably about 25% of the global TAM when you look at human capital management systems, and it's probably the fastest-growing regions as well. So it gives us a significant, if you like, presence inside the actual region. And already, we've seen impact of the Excelity acquisition in helping us win not only accounts in APJ, but other global accounts where both companies had significant headcount in the APJ region. So it fits very, very nicely. 
 In terms of the future, we'll continue to look for opportunities in-country where we can find great people, customers that provide that opportunity to move to Dayforce and to upsell and to get the local knowledge, if you like, with inside the actual marketplace. So it's -- what I would say about Ascender, it's very much in line with what we communicated to the market well over a year ago. 
Bryan Bergin: Okay. And then a follow-up here around the Bureau. Can you comment on what the Bureau migration benefit to Dayforce was in fiscal '20 and what's left in the Bureau that you expect to be potentially convertible here in the future? At what point is it based out at? 
David Ossip: So the numbers for 2020 were 5.8, 5.8, 5.1 and 4.1 -- sorry, 4.4 across the year. As we go into next year, obviously, we're going to start to see lower numbers as we come into the actual end. And by the end of 2021, they effectively should be almost no Bureau revenue as it relates to payroll. 
 Noemie or Jeremy, anything that you would add to color about what remains at the end of the year. 
Noemie Heuland: No. On that, David, I think you covered it all. But on Ascender, the other point I would make on the acquisition and why it's very relevant for us is on the global operating model that we are trying to build. I mean, we've been so far North American Canadian company centered around serving customers globally. 
 And now if you start to add Excelity, RITEQ and now Ascender, we're really building a region in APJ to serve our customers locally with the robust partners ecosystem, and we have a strong leadership that's going to come on board as well with deep knowledge of the customer. So I think that's also very critical for us in that regard as we're building a real global company. So I just wanted to highlight that for you as well. But I really think you covered it all, David. 
Jeremy Johnson: The next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy, Mark at JPM. 
Mark Murphy: Going back to the comment about the impact from the second wave of COVID is certainly understandable. Can you help us understand maybe how many transactions in total you were looking at or the dollar value bookings that closed in January? And I think, more importantly, just is your suspicion -- are you trying to convey that you are past the period where there would be those kinds of disruptions sounds outweigh based on your commentary, but just with vaccines rolling out and kind of the infections trending a little lower, do you think that, that might have been a bit of a one-off? 
David Ossip: So -- and Mark, I would say, at the end of last year, we started to see fatigue, if you like, in the customer teams. What I mean by that is that we didn't have the same urgency that we typically have at end of year where it's all hands on deck from the customer to get the contract signed. So even though we were at black lines with the actual customers, getting that final signature was a little bit more effort than we've seen beforehand. So shortly after New Year, those transactions close, we're talking about a handful of customers, 3 or 4 large transactions that moved over into the January. 
 In terms of COVID, we didn't see the recovery that we had expected in Q4. And as I mentioned, we had thought that the headwinds in terms of employment numbers would improve between $1 million to $2 million in Q4. In reality, we only saw about $0.5 million of recovery. And so we are still seeing impact of COVID, if you like, in Q1 in terms of employment counts. We do believe, though, by the second half of the year, we should be through that. 
 In the U.S., already, I would say, it looks like -- and we've seen the numbers being published that the employment numbers in the U.S. seem to be going up. Canada, though, it's a little bit behind because I think you know the vaccine rollout in Canada hasn't been as successful as it is in the U.S. 
Mark Murphy: Okay. If I can sneak in a quick follow-up. I think that the growth in the Dayforce revenue per customer that you've listed here, 8.5% during 2020, it's quite impressive, that has to be well above your peer group. Is it possible to just unpack that in terms of how much is larger customers you brought on that are lifting that average up versus how much of that is the existing base kind of absorbing more of your technologies? 
David Ossip: So it's -- look, if I look at the ratios at the end of the year, it still was about 53% in kind of the mid-major markets and about 35% in the enterprise side. What we are seeing, though, is tremendous upsell across our customer base. Now if I go back a year ago, when we spoke about add-ons, we typically were speaking about additional modules that we're adding to the customer. Now we're also seeing the impact of global. So last year, the add-ons were about 20%. If I look at Q4, we were at 25%, and I would say that probably is the impact of the global employee populations that we're actually adding on to Dayforce. 
 The other point that I've mentioned that if I look at the actual growth in terms of employment accounts, we obviously are up about 9%, I believe, in terms of the average size in Q4. But remember, that is after taking into account the employment headwinds that we typically wouldn't have had and the float headwind. So if you actually corrected from that, I think it actually would have been even more significant. 
 Other metrics that I really do think are impressive that even in a COVID year, our retention rate remained around 96% on Cloud. And if I look at our net retention rate, we remained at about 106%. And I think those are very, very strong numbers. 
Jeremy Johnson: Next question comes from the line of Arvind Ramnani from Piper Sandler. 
Arvind Ramnani: I wanted to really kind of go back to digital wallet. You've provided some good color on it. And also, part of my research has suggested that reception for On-Demand Pay continues to grow, and you'll really have a compelling solution. Can you talk about some of your customer conversations in terms of your -- are customers kind of looking at your digital wallet as a reason to [indiscernible] versus the competitor? How much is it helping on the win rates? And even if the metrics are not high in terms of actually usage, is this kind of like a secular driver where we are in the early stages, and the next 2, 3 years will become fairly mainstream? 
David Ossip: So it definitely is having an impact on our win rate on Dayforce. As I mentioned, we've seen about an 80% attachment rate of wallet to new customers. The metrics that we now also have, if I look at -- remember, when we build a module, we've used the same methodology from a very onset, which is what are the KPIs we can impact at the customer through use of the actual module and how does an improvement in that KPI translates into dollar or money benefit for the customer. And so when I look at the actual wallet metrics that we're now able to look at, and we get that by looking at wallet users versus the general population of our customers, and we obviously have almost 5,000 customers now. So we have a big group we did a test in. 
 We're seeing the benefit on the talent acquisition side and on retention side. And just the retention side alone, I mean, if you actually run through the numbers, you get a 42% reduction in voluntary turnover. And if you just make the math easy, you say, okay, a person makes $50,000. We're looking at typically a 10% voluntary attrition rate at a company. If they have 1,000 employees, that means that they typically would lose about 100 people per year. If we can impact that by reducing that by 40%, that means that we can save them 40 people. The cost of replacing each of those people is probably 25% of their salary. So 12.5 $1,000 per person, times 40 people, right? And that's obviously a big number. That's about 100,000 just from the use of the wallet in that particular customer. 
 So you're beginning to see the ROI. And again, it ties back to the whole premise we have to create quantifiable value for our customers. Now with wallet, we extend that onto the employee side as well. Because when an employee actually begins to use a wallet, they get access to their funds continually. So if you have a credit card bill that comes due in the middle of the month between pay periods, this allows you to pay off your credit card as opposed to doing the minimum payment paying the interest of 22% on the full balance. And also, if you are someone who is really a non-bank employee or you paycheck to paycheck, it allows you to avoid those very extensive fees of going to payday loan or to actually other types of extensive types of borrowing. 
 And when we look at the way that we built the wallet, it leverages that continuous pay engine that we have with inside Dayforce. Remember, as we compare to any other competitor in market, with us, we have one system with one rule engine, so that's continually throughout the pay period, we calculate your net earnings. The wallet allows the employee to see how much they've made net of other deductions and taxes added to the Dayforce wallet, go off and spend it. We don't charge the customer anything for the use of the wallet. We don't have them change the way that they fund their payroll. They still fund at the end of the actual payroll cycle. We don't charge the employee any direct fees or the usage of the actual wallet to load money onto the actual wallet or to actually do the spend. So again, we're creating tremendous value for the employees of our customers as well as for the customer base. And that is a big differentiation relative to anyone else in the market. 
Arvind Ramnani: Yes. Yes. Absolutely. That's an incredible success, and I appreciate providing the detailed metrics. Given the high ROI, philosophically, will wallet always be essentially a free product? Or at some point, when there's broad enough usage, there may be some fees? Or are you just going to look at like changing [indiscernible]? 
David Ossip: I think fundamentally, we would have just a kind of, let's call an ESG, a challenge of actually charging employees for the usage of the wallet. I think that will go counter to what we're trying to do. 
 Remember, our brand promises to make work-life better. And I don't think charging those employees, especially those employees who can't afford to pay usage of the wallet, I think that is actually ethically wrong. So the intent to be here is to make sure that we design the wallet in the way that we can benefit from the interchange, at least in North America, that funds the wallet and allows us to make a nice profit through the use of the wallet. 
Jeremy Johnson: Our next question comes from Josh Reilly, who's in for Scott Berg at Needham. 
Joshua Reilly: So I was curious, what are you guys seeing with usage trends on the platform during the pandemic now that you have several quarters of data points here? Are there any modules that might be surging in activity or upselling better than the pre-pandemic period? And then are you using any of that data in the sales process to cross-sell complementary modules? 
David Ossip: So we've obviously seen a lift in terms of add-ons, as I've mentioned, in 2020. In 2019, we averaged about 20% of our monthly sales were add-ons to the base. That grew to 25% in 2020. And part of that was the global add to the employee bases, but we obviously did see as well additional module add-ons. The type of add-ons that we typically saw were typically things around learning management, performance management, the compensation, the engagement surveys. 
 If I look into 2021, very optimistic about what we're going to see in terms of the hub and the hub plus that are coming out. I believe we'll continue to see benefit from the benefit intelligence that we released at the end of last year, which again focused on that quantifiable value and very, very strong ROI for the customers. 
 So Josh, we did see obviously more usage across the modules and feels a general trend for more digitization across our customer base. 
Joshua Reilly: Okay. Great. And then just one follow-up. International outside of Canada obviously has been growing as an opportunity here given the M&A activity and investments in native payroll. How should we think about what regions you're going to be targeting for sales and marketing investments here in 2021? Obviously, we focused on APJ, but is there anything else that we should be aware of where there's a pretty meaningful opportunity here? 
David Ossip: Well, obviously, we're building out major pay for Germany at the moment. We've been quite successful in market with our workforce management product inside that particular region. And so you'll see us do a lot more investments in Germany and the surrounding countries. 
Jeremy Johnson: Next question comes from the line of Yao Chew at Crédit Suisse. 
Yaoxian Chew: David, I have one philosophical one for you on M&A. I can't imagine you have the only one hunting for these assets out there. Can you help us explain how Ceridian is differentiated or advantaged as a buyer versus the either sponsors or local acquirers and maybe looking at the same assets that you are? 
David Ossip: I think a lot of it comes down to what we can actually offer the employees or those particular customers. I think if you look at us compared to where they typically would land up with the companies, for a lot more attractive options. 
 Remember, if you look at the history of Ceridian today, it really started with the acquisition of Dayforce. And if you look at how we leverage the people from Dayforce, myself, would be an example of that, in creating really significant career opportunities with inside the really an organization. 
 And as Noemie mentioned, a large part of doing the Ascender acquisition was that we are now beginning to transition from that North American company operating globally to really a more of a regional model. And Ascender gives us really critical mass inside the APJ region, which again further differentiates us from the other players inside the actual market. 
 On the global side, I do believe we have a significant opportunity to be differentiated in terms of our technology platform and how we can actually, if you like, leverage the people that we see inside country to win more and more customers. 
Yaoxian Chew: That's great. And if I may, just have one quick follow-up on the pricing environment. Can you speak at a high level just how pricing has trended more broadly and the competitive dynamic? Are you seeing rationalizing the marketplace? Do you expect pricing to recover from what you might call depressed second half COVID levels? How you just conceptually approach pricing and competition here? 
David Ossip: I don't think that pricing really changed in 2020 as compared to 2019. What I would say is it came down to more to contract terms as us and others provide more flexible terms to our customers starting in Q2 of last year just given the inherent risk of COVID. 
Jeremy Johnson: Next question comes from Kevin Kumar who's in for Chris Merwin at Goldman Sachs. 
Kevin Kumar: Question on Powerpay. How should we think about COVID and employment impacts to that business and the trajectory of growth? Should we think of it similar to Dayforce seeing kind of a rebound in the back half of '21? 
David Ossip: I think that Powerpay is going to be under more pressure than Dayforce because it largely is -- what only is a small business in Canada. And if we look at Canada, the largest markets that we have, which would be Toronto and Montreal, are both under lockdown. So we are seeing more revenue pressure on Powerpay than we are seen on Dayforce. 
 To kind of quantify it. When we actually look towards Q1, the headwind, I believe, for Powerpay, Jeremy, is going to be what about a $3 million or so? 
Noemie Heuland: Yes. That's correct. 
David Ossip: Going into Q1. Whereas we look at Dayforce, which is a much more significant revenue stream in aggregate, is about $6.5 million. So it's obviously -- Powerpay is still feeling covering much more than we are seeing with Dayforce. 
 And now I think the recovery is largely determined on the Canadians really getting the act together in terms of vaccine distribution. And currently, it looks like the expectation is that they'll be able to provide vaccines to everyone who wants it by the end of Q3, which is somewhat in line with the U.S., although it's going to start probably a quarter later. 
Jeremy Johnson: Next question comes from Brad Clark at BMO. 
Bradley Clark: Just wanted to revisit Cloud revenue retention rate tick down a little bit compared to 2020. Just want to understand how much was employment impacting that metric versus other factors in the market. 
David Ossip: Sure. So the employment would actually impact really the net retention rate, which effectively remain constant around 106 about -- on the average, if you add on less the unemployment numbers, you basically net it to the same amount. In terms of the actual retention rate, it came in at kind of 195.8 relative to 96.3 the year before or 96 the year before that. So largely around 96% over the last 3 years. It was impacted by some of the small business losses that we saw on Dayforce that were linked to very small Powerpay customers that went out of business. 
Jeremy Johnson: Next question comes from Matt Pfau at William Blair. 
Matthew Pfau: Just wanted to ask on the international expansion strategy. So you kind of seem to be taking 2 different approaches with Europe a bit more organic in terms of the build-out and Asia Pac a bit more driven by acquisitions. So maybe just the rationale behind the different strategies there. And then also in terms of the partner program, any difference in how you think about that between the 2 different regions? 
David Ossip: Yes. So actually, in reality, they're not that different. So if I look at UKI, we built out native payroll for first the U.K. and then we extended into Ireland. And we've been very successful there, but we started with a little bit more momentum given the history that we had inside the country beforehand. 
 In Australia, we started off by building native, time and payroll for the ANZ market. We've entered an acquisition of RITEQ, which largely was to get people who understood the workforce management side to allow us to continue doing implementations inside the region. 
 Excelity and Ascender slightly different because we were expanding our scope outside of ANZ into the broader APJ type of region. And particularly with Ascender, we're picking up a wonderful team of really experienced people in the ANZ marketplace that we do believe will further differentiated but also allow us to continue to grow inside that region. 
 When we look more broadly on the global market, you'll continue to see that we're building out major pay for Germany. That doesn't mean that we weren't, looking for some of the types of assets around that particular type of region. We still have to ourself looking towards Latin America and other parts of Europe. The world is a big place. So there are lots and lots of opportunities out there. And I do believe that the Dayforce global strategy from a technology platform perspective is very differentiated with the other players in market. 
Matthew Pfau: Got it. And then in terms of the partner strategy, any difference between the different regions? 
David Ossip: Sorry. That's a great question. I'm sorry. Noemie mentioned that beforehand, another very attractive piece of both Ascender and Excelity where both the software partners and the SI partnerships that we picked up with that. And just on the SI side, we've made tremendous progress in terms of building out a network of system integrators, many of them being the large global SIs. If we look at it, I would say it's not really differentiated by a region, but largely by size of customer. But as we begin to play more and more in that large enterprise space, you'll see us doing much more work with the large system integrators. And the shareholder letter report are one example, which was a government opportunity that we actually partnered with a system integrator. In fact, they are leading, and they led the contracts for that particular account. 
Jeremy Johnson: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Silvestre from Veritas. 
Chris Silvestre: Just another one on wallet, if you don't mind. Of course, like the digital wallet space is very active right now, and Ceridian seems to be in a very privileged position with what seems like a captive audience. So just wondering whether you see an opportunity to add some more of the typical wallet functionality that's proven really popular over the past year and help some of these other wallets kind of achieve virality and really explosive growth like peer-to-peer transfers, and I know this is more of a stretch but digital currencies and whatnot. So that's kind of part one. 
 And I know you need critical mass, which leads me to my second question. Why not 
 [Audio Gap] 
 of wallet? I mean, what... 
David Ossip: Sorry. Chris, you seem to have frozen up on the second part of your question. But in terms of your first question, yes, we are adding the typical wallet features that you would see, things like bill pay, peer-to-peer transfers, OCT transfers. 
 Another area that we do have a large differentiation is really around direct deposit. And so as we're adding more and more pay card capability to the actual wallet technology should allow us to actually capture even more, if you like, usage of the actual wallet. 
 What I will say about wallet is we brought on a very seasoned individual in the -- in Q4. He joined us from Green Dot. [ Seth ] has, obviously, wonderful, tremendous experience on the consumer side as it pertains to wallet technology. chris, I see you're still there. It looks like you're having network issues, but you want to try to maybe ask your second part of your question again? 
Chris Silvestre: Yes. Sorry about that. So the second question is, I guess, I know you need some like critical mass for some of the peer-to-peer stuff. And I'm just wondering, why not accelerate the rollout of wallet? I mean, what prevents you from reaching out to all the customers and just turning it on right away for anyone who wants to use it? Is it just -- what's the limiting factor there? 
David Ossip: Well, remember, we only launched the wallet in May of last year. And so for us, it's making sure that we do it properly. We create value for our customers and for our employees, that we will make sure that the experience is tremendous. Remember, from our perspective, when we look at building the product, and we talk about user experience, we don't just think, hey, we have to have a really easy-to-use mobile app, which we do. 
 We think really how do we benefit the employee by giving them continual access to their earned wages without charging them any types of fees and focus on the use cases of which most attractive to them. But if I go out a year from now, I think you'll see these features in our wallet be very much on par with some of the other wallet vendors that you'll see in market. 
 Of importance for the end of Q1, we are launching now in Canada. So at the end of Q1, we'll launch the wallet in Canada as well. 
Jeremy Johnson: And our last question comes from the line of Stephanie Price at CIBC. 
Stephanie Price: Just curious if you're seeing any change in the pace of implementations where the smaller the larger deals just given the second wave of COVID that we're going through here. 
David Ossip: Stephanie, I think Noemie actually mentioned that earlier as well. We actually saw an acceleration of implementations in Q4. What I will say is, I think, again, we're differentiated in markets in that we have a robust technology. There are almost 5,000 customers using Dayforce today. When a customer signs up, we have a very high confidence that we can take the customer live, on time and on budget and with a very good customer experience. And if I look at our Net Promoter Scores on implementation, year-over-year, they were up significantly. 
 So even during this COVID period, not have we been able to only accelerate implementations, but we also have seen much better implementation experiences as measured by NPS. 
Stephanie Price: Right. And maybe just one follow-up. Just curious with the composition of bookings in Q4 versus Q3. And any sense of where you think kind of the strongest demand across the client size? 
David Ossip: It's a hard question. We continue to do very well in major markets. But obviously, we're seeing a lot of success in the enterprise space as well. So I would say it's very much in line with what we saw in Q3 and probably earlier in the year as well. 
Jeremy Johnson: That concludes the earnings call for today. I want to thank you for joining and for the excellent questions and wish everyone have a happy -- have a good evening. Thank you very much. 
David Ossip: Thank you, everyone. Have a great one. 
Noemie Heuland: Thank you, everyone.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-11-05 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Okay, Jeremy, I'll turn it over to you. 
Jeremy Johnson: Thanks, Nikki. Greetings.
 My name is Jeremy Johnson, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations at Ceridian. I'd like to welcome everyone to our third quarter earnings call.
 [Operator Instructions] And a question-and-answer session will follow the formal remarks. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
 On the call today, we have Ceridian's CEO, David Ossip; and CFO, Noemie Heuland.

 The third quarter stockholder letter, earnings release and quarterly report on Form 10-Q have been furnished or filed with the SEC and will be available on the SEC's EDGAR database in the U.S. and the SEDAR database in Canada as well as on the Ceridian investor relations website at investors.ceridian.com.
 With that, I will turn the call over to David. 
David Ossip: Thanks, Jeremy. And good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining our earnings call. I hope that everyone is staying healthy and safe.
 Before we go to Q&A, I want to spend a few minutes on some important points from our stockholders letter. First, we had a strong quarter. Dayforce recurring revenue, total revenue and adjusted EBITDA were above our expectations. Despite COVID-19 headwinds, Dayforce's recurring revenue excluding float grew by 17.9%. And Cloud recurring gross margin increased by 20 basis points to 70.4% and, excluding float revenue, expanded by 190 basis points. Second, as expected, sales for the third quarter accelerated and were in line with the expectations we had for the business before the COVID-19 pandemic. For the fourth quarter, we expect double-digit year-over-year sales growth, which would result in the largest sales quarter in our history.
 Third, Dayforce Wallet continues to go very well and we remain confident in the wallet's strategy. Today, we have more than 60 customers using the wallet, and over 200 more have signed up but are not yet implemented. Our Dayforce Wallet's attachment rate to new sales has been approximately 80%, which we expect to lead compounded adoption as those customers are taken live. And finally, we expect Dayforce recurring revenue growth excluding float and on a constant currency basis of between 18% to 19% in the fourth quarter and above 19% for the first quarter of 2021, both assuming continued gradual improvement in customer employment levels.
 I'd like to hand it back to Jeremy to open the call up for questions and answers. 
Jeremy Johnson: Thanks, David.
 As we go through the Q&A portion of this call, I'll announce your name. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. 
Jeremy Johnson: Our first question tonight comes from the line of Alex Zukin. 
Aleksandr Zukin: David, can you talk about just the selling environment as it has evolved both through the quarter that the third quarter and as you look into the fourth quarter? You even gave guidance for Q1. What have you seen in kind of the sales cycles? What have you seen in the pipelines? What have you seen in win rates? And then also what you're seeing in kind of retention now that we're so far through the pandemic and you had customers that had layoffs and furloughs. What you're seeing there would be great. 
David Ossip: Sure. So I think there are about 5 questions [ in that 1 question ], but yes, thanks for that. Sales in the last quarter, Q3, recovered to pre-COVID levels. So again if we looked at the budget we had back in January, we had obviously very aggressive sales targets for the year and Q3 numbers came in line with that. And we're also seeing continued momentum into Q4, so a very robust sell-in environment. And I would say, as far as COVID goes, I believe that the sell-in environment is back to pre-COVID levels, so we're quite encouraged. We saw wins not only in North America, but if you go through the stockholder letter, you can see we had significant wins on a global basis as well, which is evidence of our move into the enterprise market and as well our expansion globally. In addition, we saw some benefit from the Excelity acquisition. So we're now seeing influence in global customers that have populations across APJ, where we are seeing increased pipeline, increased conversion and increased influence based on the Excelity acquisition. So we're very pleased of that.
 In terms of employment levels, employment levels have come back probably another about 1% since last quarter. So they are still down when we measure it on an average employee basis per customer. However, the aggregate number of employees paid on the Dayforce system is up obviously year-over-year, hence the growth rate that we see of approximately about 17.9% on Dayforce recurring. 
Aleksandr Zukin: Perfect. And then as a follow-up if you start thinking about you've made a number of new hires to the executive team at the technical level, at the sales level, at the partnership level. When you think about the big initiatives for investors to focus on as we start lapping the COVID compares and you start thinking about the kinds of growth rates that you could put up even as we think from 1Q to 2Q sequentially, what are the things to pay attention to? What are the growth tailwinds that you see from some of those hires you think we'll be able to bring that we should pay attention to? 
David Ossip: Sure. So as we mentioned in the stockholder letter, the hires all have global experience and experience at scale. And so what you'll see from the group that we brought on are 2 things: one, continued acceleration of sales as we go into next year, and that should translate in the second half of the year back to pre-COVID Dayforce revenue growth levels. And the second thing that you should continue to see is an improvement in profitability because, from a culture perspective, the way I describe moving from a start-up culture into one of scale is you go from heroics to having true processes that allow you to scale the company profitably. 
Jeremy Johnson: Our next question is going to come from the line of Matt Coss from JPMorgan. 
Matthew Coss: It's Matt Coss on behalf of Mark Murphy. David, digging a little deeper into the 11 large global enterprise deals: Were these global vendors? Were these takeaways from global vendors? Were they takeaways from regional ones? And as you look at your partnership with Excelity, do you think Excelity could have won these standalone, or is it really the combination of Ceridian with Excelity? 
David Ossip: So there's a combination. As we expand globally, for example, in the U.K., often we are replacing local incumbents. When we talk about deals in Germany and in APJ, often we are replacing the larger ERP companies or still some incumbent technologies that they might have in place. In terms of Excelity, in some cases they have won stand-alone deals separate from the Dayforce software. And in addition, we are seeing, as I mentioned, crossover between the Dayforce sales and added sales from Excelity payroll components. 
Matthew Coss: Okay, very good. And then just a little bit of follow-up maybe on Alex's question. So I guess maybe it's obvious that you should return to pre-COVID levels of sales given the improvements in the economy, but I think there are some industries that are still really hurting. And although unemployment is better than it was, it's so much higher than pre-COVID levels. So just sort of how do you see Ceridian sort of... 
David Ossip: Yes. So Matt, just one clarification. I don't see sales returning to pre-COVID levels. In Q3, sales were at pre-COVID levels, so I believe the market has already shifted back into a buying type of mode. We are seeing purchases across the industry. It's not only in what we would have tabled or described as being surge industry. So obviously, we're seeing quite a bit in health care, but we are still seeing some of the industries that have been impacted like transportation or recreation still buying systems from us. 
Jeremy Johnson: The next question is going to come from the line of Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho. 
Sitikantha Panigrahi: David, last quarter, you talked about very strong incremental revenue from new clients. I'm wondering. How is that trend this quarter? And in fact, you have expanded to a robust product portfolio, so what sort of modules do you see increase traction within your new client base? 
David Ossip: So we are continuing to see strong new sales from new customers. Obviously, we were very happy with the sales that were brought in, in Q3. The trend of customers buying add-on modules, I don't believe, has changed materially. We've still seen about a 20% of our sales being add-ons to the existing base. As to what modules, I don't think that's changed either. It's obviously the LMS side, performance, compensation. More recently, we have engagement surveys. Dayforce Wallet, although we don't charge a subscription fee, we are seeing an 80%, 8-0 percent, attachment rate to new sales. 
Sitikantha Panigrahi: Okay. And then a follow-up to that. Historically, December is your big demand for go live, so I'm wondering. Now that you are doing virtual implementation, how is the pipeline looking for go live this year? 
David Ossip: We were very happy with the go-to-lives in Q3. And so as we go into Q4, we expect that the go-lives will come in on budget. Obviously, if we compare it year-over-year, there is some impact from the first 2 quarters of the year in terms of sales because, Q1, Q2, we typically would take live, as you know, in the December time frame. We haven't seen any impact in terms of what I would call go-live productivity issues in terms of working from home and working remotely. 2 examples I'll give you: One is the theater company that I think we went live. Jeremy, it must have been, what, 3 months? 
Jeremy Johnson: That's right. 
David Ossip: That was a takeaway from 1 of the -- 1 of our 2 top competitors, so that was very encouraging. The other one will be a large home health care organization with about 30,000 employees, and they went live in about a 9-month period. And obviously just given where we are now, almost the entire implementation was done remotely, and that's across 5,000 different locations. So what I would say is that we and our customers have worked out how to use technologies like Zoom that we're using tonight to remain very productive. 
Sitikantha Panigrahi: That's great. And Noemie, congratulation. Looking forward to working with you. 
Noemie Heuland: Thank you. 
Jeremy Johnson: Thanks, Siti. The next question is going to come from Dan Jester at Citi. 
Daniel Jester: Great. I guess, first, on sort of the wallet, you had a big hire today. And David, you've talked about sort of the road map here, new clients, new -- higher attach rate, but can you just help us think about what the wallet could look like a year from now, maybe at high level in terms of the ability to add new features to it? I mean, what's the road map look like at a high level from here? 
David Ossip: So it's a very aggressive road map, but remember we only started building the wallet about a year ago. And already, we have 60 customers -- or more than 60 customers that are actively using the wallet, and we have over 200 additional customers that have signed up for the wallet as well.
 In terms of new capabilities, we'll have a pay card functionality that will come out, I believe, this month. The pay card functionality allows the wallet to be used for traditional pay card, which means, instead of the unbanked or low-bank people getting paper checks or having to go to cash checking locations, the organization will be able to give those individuals a Dayforce card and they'll be able to pay through that. And so we're expecting to see volume increases through the use of the pay card functionality. Second, we're about to launch the Dayforce Wallet in Canada, and I believe that happens later this month as well. Ceridian will be the first customer using it. So I personally am actually quite excited to use the actual wallet, which will be great. We're also adding the ability now to do automatic top-up, much like on your Starbucks card, but when it goes below a certain level, automatically it tops up. And that will be coming out, I believe, in this particular quarter as well. There are aspects of bill pay that we're adding to the actual system. On a longer-term basis, we'll be moving more to financial wellness, so things like interest-bearing and savings accounts. We call them buckets with inside the actual wallet. They will be coming up. And then there's a typical feature that you would expect, things like secondary cards, peer-to-peer transfers and the like, so we're quite excited with it. We have INSIGHTS in 2 weeks, which is our large customer conference. We're very excited with that. We expect to have over 10,000 attendees, which is about a 5x increase over the attendance that we saw last year, which talks a little bit about how working remotely and working from home, when attached to a proper digital marketing strategy, can actually boost pipeline and such, but we'll be talking a lot about the extension of the wallet beyond just payments. 
Daniel Jester: Great. That's very helpful color. I appreciate it. And then with regards to profitability, this quarter, EBITDA came above your guidance. And a couple times in your prepared remarks, you've talked about profitability, scaling the business, et cetera, so can you help us think about sort of the puts and takes over the next year in terms of the margin? I mean clearly you're being impacted by the lack of float income and low interest rates, but on the flip side you have the benefits of scale and other investments, so how should we think about margins evolving from here? 
David Ossip: Yes. So first, as employment levels come back, that adds not only to revenue, but it's almost a complete flow down to the bottom line. So for example, if a customer has 1,000 employees versus, say, 1,100 employees, there's no cost difference to us between 1,100 or the 1,000. So as employment levels come back, we should see a slight lift as well on the actual profitability side. We'll see continued improvements from scale, as you mentioned, which effectively come down to lower per-employee hosting costs and lower per-employee support costs with inside the application as well. In terms of EBITDA, we are going to continue making investments next year. So we'll continue investing in global, in enterprise, in the wallet and the extension of the wallet that we'll be discussing at INSIGHTS as well. One point that we should probably call out is that on the EBITDA side, whereas in the second quarter we did not accrue for bonuses just based on COVID impact, in Q3, based on the performance of the company, we did do a accrual for bonus payout for our staff. So the results were actually very strong. 
Jeremy Johnson: Next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin at Wells Fargo. 
Michael Turrin: I'm assuming you can hear and maybe even see me okay. I want to just focus in on both kind of the upmarket and the small business trends you're seeing. I mean obviously the upmarket metrics look strong. We continue to note in the shareholder letter it's just the size of customers that you're talking about continuing to increase as well. There's also some commentary around some of the smaller businesses that you've seen and some customer losses or churn on that side. It looks like, net-net, we would expect upmarket to weigh heavier and no change to your Cloud retention expectations but just want to kind of speak to the push-pull of those 2 sides. 
David Ossip: Yes. So Michael, let me just start a little bit higher up from that. About 90% of our Cloud revenue is Dayforce, and Dayforce has largely targeted what we call major markets in the enterprise space. In that population, we've obviously seen a nice improvement in terms of employment levels. So we've seen it go up slightly from the end of Q2, although still down from what we would have seen in terms of average head count last year. In terms of Powerpay, which is our small business Canadian-only product, the -- we did see a V-shaped recovery in terms of employment levels, but the recovery level is not yet at the same levels as we saw prior to COVID. And there obviously has been some impact to the number of Dayforce clients because, as we called out in the shareholder letter, about 80 Powerpay payroll customers that were using Dayforce time and attendance went out of business. Now in terms of recovery, I would expect a similar pattern. The smaller the companies are, I think they're more impacted by waves 2 and wave 3 and the different types of lockdowns that you see across jurisdiction, whereas the larger companies typically have more resilience. 
Michael Turrin: Helpful. Maybe just a quick follow-on, if I may, Noemie, congrats on the new role, since we have you here almost live and in person and David might want to break for a second. Just any initial observations, key priorities or areas of focus for yourself as you're coming onboard and ramping into the new role? 
Noemie Heuland: Sure. Thanks for the question. No, I'm very happy to be here actually. I'm very amazed by the leadership team, the culture of the company. I come from a place where we innovated to serve our customers, and I find that here as well. And the growth is very amazing. I'm excited about the opportunities to further increase our market share. The growth drivers, as David mentioned, the global expansions, the move to the enterprise, are areas that I think I can bring a lot of experience from SAP, and I'm very excited. Thanks. 
Jeremy Johnson: Our next question comes from the line of Samad Samana from Jefferies. 
Samad Samana: So David, first, just I'm curious. We didn't hear much about public sector this quarter. I'm just curious. You've made investments following the push in Canada's modernization side. I'm curious if you have any updates on progress both on that front, but just more broadly I know you were saying that it could dovetail into other public sector opportunities. And then one follow-up. 
David Ossip: Yes. So on the Canadian government, no update over there, obviously much slower with COVID. However, we are seeing a lot of traction at the municipal level of government where we've had some nice wins and some nice go-lives, and I expect that will continue. 
Samad Samana: Great. And then just as I -- during the quarter, we had heard some feedback that maybe there were -- kind of the sales leadership structure, there was like a regional change there. I'm just curious if -- well, I don't know if that's right or wrong, but just as a follow-up, we want to make sure we understand if there were any changes. Or if you can just remind us maybe how that sales leadership is working on a regional level. And that's it for me. 
David Ossip: Sure. So it's not so much regional, but as you know, we are continually investing in our own organization as we transition from this founder-led type of culture to one that has more scale and more predictability and more equality with inside the workforce. And so the changes we made over there were to -- effectively to uplift the sales organization, as we do believe that we can see more -- we can see potential for much more productivity out of the sales organization. Remember we're saying that even with a very, very high-performing sales organization that executed at pre-COVID levels in the last quarter. 
Samad Samana: Great. That's helpful. And Noemie, let me just echo the congrats [ on others ] for joining, and look forward to getting to know you better as well. 
Noemie Heuland: Thank you. Looking forward to it. 
Jeremy Johnson: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin at Cowen. 
Bryan Bergin: I wanted to ask. Given the international success that you've had, can you give us an update on the expansion strategy there? And any considerations of accelerating any particular regions? 
David Ossip: Sure. Bryan, thanks for the question on that. We are building out, as you know, Germany, and we're building out Mexico at the current time. We've had actually quite a lot of success in Germany already with the actual product. We spoke about Henkel inside the stockholder letter, which was one of the largest sales we've ever done, with over 50,000 employees on a global basis. So we're quite encouraged with that. We are obviously inquisitive to different types of Excelity types of opportunities that we believe we can acquire, migrate the tech over to the Dayforce side, continue building out the Dayforce platform to have more native countries and go from -- so as they come up, we do look at all opportunities. 
Bryan Bergin: Okay. And then just on the wallet. On the back end, as that scales, what are you considering around the financing of that? 
David Ossip: So we haven't spoken too much about the actual financing at the moment other than our cost of funds is probably about 8 to 10 basis points per actual load. So -- and we compare that to the interchange that is about 125 basis points. And there's the program management fees so that we net about 80 basis points on a -- in particular a $1 spend. So 0.8% type of profit. As we go forward, we are looking at ways to actually structure the back end of the wallet with various types of kind of banking, if you like, avenues. And I think we'll speak a lot more about that in the second half of next year. 
Jeremy Johnson: Next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird. 
Mark Marcon: I'm wondering. Can you talk a little bit more about the implementation pipeline and how you see that unfolding as this year progresses, particularly with the calendar year start-up time period? And then I have a question with regards to the clients that have put in place the on-demand payroll. 
David Ossip: Sure. So Mark, I think what you're asking is what is the revenue buildup into next year. 
Mark Marcon: That's correct. 
David Ossip: And so [indiscernible] because, as you know, we do start recognizing recurring revenue when a customer goes live. Q1, we had impact in terms of sales at the very end, in kind of late March. Q2, I think we saw the majority of the impact from COVID, but as we did mention in our Q2 call, Q2 sales still came in above our Q2 sales levels in 2019. And Q3, obviously, we're back to the levels that we had expected at the beginning of the year. You have to obviously roll that forward, and typically you can look at a 6- to 9-month implementation time line for most customers. So in terms of revenue, the trough really was Q3 that we've just coming out. You'll see a slight acceleration but still an impact from the Q2 sales into Q4. As we go into Q1, you'll start to see a little bit more acceleration. And by the second half of next year, we should be back to the previous growth rates that we saw. 
Mark Marcon: That's great. And then with regards to the clients that have put in place the digital wallet, the 60 that you mentioned, what sort of take-up rates are you seeing there? And what sort of changes in terms of the behavior are you seeing? And what's the feedback from the clients just in terms of like the ease of handling the requests? Is the payroll department getting any additional work? Or has it been fairly smooth? 
David Ossip: So let me just start with the bank. The way that we differentiate from the other pay -- on-demand pay vendors in the base is that there is no reconciliation for the payroll staff. So the payroll close is the same with the wallet as it is without the wallet. And as you know, we don't change the way that the customers have to fund their payroll either. We act as a commercial lender to the customer. So no change in actual process. Second, we're seeing very good responses. If you just do a quick search, if you do a Google search for Dayforce Wallet, Facebook; and then put in the word care, you will see how many of our customers are now leading their job postings by discussing the Dayforce Wallet. And if you come to INSIGHTS or if you attend INSIGHTS, well, we have a number of videos of people who are using the wallet talking about their experience. And we also have the HR people and the payroll people also talking about their testimonies. So we're very, very pleased with the experience that people are having from the wallet; and that was one of the reasons that we built the wallet. We saw a obvious way to improve the employee experience when it came to payments. And from our perspective, we question the construct of a pay period. To us, it seems like an antiquated construct from 1940s technology on that.
 In terms of uptake, remember we still are piloting the wallet. And so I can speak about the uptake across the pilot populations, which we're seeing somewhere between that 15% to 20% uptake rate, which is what we had expected. When we had done research in the industry, as we previously have discussed, the 20% uptake of the on-demand pay piece was what we had thought we would see originally. And in addition to that, once we have the pay card functionality, we believe we'll also get pickup from people who are still receiving paper checks and are kind of nonbank -- low-bank, unbanked type of people. 
Mark Marcon: Great. And then one last one, if I may. Are you seeing any sort of change in terms of competitive dynamics with regards to obviously on the workforce management Kronos is going through a lot. If we think about your key competitors ADP and Ultimate, as it relates to HCM, they're both going through multiple steps, obviously UKG having consolidated. Any sort of change in terms of those competitive dynamics in terms of impacting your win rates? 
David Ossip: No. I think our win rates have remained quite strong. Obviously, as you've pointed out, the 2 vendors are going through quite a lot of changes, 1 trying to transition from a service-based organization into a software organization and the other obviously going through tremendous -- what I expect will be tremendous merger types of challenges and a little bit of obscurity as to product strategy in market. And so we have been fortunate to be in the situation where we are -- we have a very stable product with very high customer satisfaction scores. We can take our customers live predictably. And we have obviously this continuous calculation engine, which leads into the ability to pay people immediately. And all of those have led to a very strong competitive position. 
Jeremy Johnson: Next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow at Barclays. 
Raimo Lenschow: David, can you talk a little bit about, if you look international and look at the expansion there, obviously like Europe is going a little bit back into kind of lockdown scenarios, et cetera. Help us understand a little bit what you're seeing there. And how will that potentially impact you or not potentially impact you given that you've got -- have been working virtually for quite a while already, anyway? 
David Ossip: A lot of our global growth at the moment is really coming out of the countries where we have native payroll. And so in terms of the U.K., we're still seeing a very robust pipeline and a lot of sales activity. And we were very pleased with the traction that we got in Q3 and Q2 in the U.K. The same is true across ANZ, where we have a Dayforce native product. And as I mentioned, we're seeing a positive impact from the APJ. We've, I believe, completed the Dayforce Connected Pay integration with the Excelity components, so I think we're okay from that perspective. Germany, we've been successful, but remember we're not going to launch native payroll for Germany until next year. So I think we're somewhat fine from that perspective. 
Raimo Lenschow: Yes. And then one follow-up. Like, so last week, we obviously had the big HR tech conference, and you guys showed really up in the [ CRC ] survey in terms of customer satisfaction, et cetera. The one thing that was interesting, though, there is they had a lot stronger customer demand in customers around more than 2,000 seats and below actually. I don't know if you saw that, which was slightly surprising to me. Is there some potential notion to kind of go also in that direction? Because historically you've been more in that 3,000 to 5,000 and moving higher, but it was interesting to see the spend intent was actually very strong for you on the way down as well. Just kind of maybe some comments around that one. 
David Ossip: Yes. Look, the product is truly differentiated in market. And it is a very big market. And remember the whole design of the application was can we identify batch-based workflows that shouldn't exist in -- with today's technology. And can we solve them elegantly? And if you do that, it doesn't matter if you're a 500-employee company or a 50,000-employee company. You're going to get tremendous efficiency improvements. And those efficiency improvements, by the way, if you're a user of the system, means you're taking frustration out of the user experience of having to wait for batch-based processes or duplicate data entry or, as I mentioned with the other on-demand pay [ products ], unnecessary reconciliation. For example, if you use one of our competitors' time products with a different pay product, you have what they call reconciliation Fridays. We don't have any of that. So yes, there's very strong kind of demand for a system like ours regardless of segment. For us, it really comes down to where do we get an ROI and what the unit economics are given that we still are trying to improve EBITDA as we go forward. 
Jeremy Johnson: The next question comes from the line of Matthew Pfau from William Blair. 
Matthew Pfau: Just a quick one in terms of the competitive environment now that one of your competitors has merged. Just wondering if you've seen any change there. Any change competitively, product-wise or perhaps in terms of sales turnover that has impacted you guys at all? 
David Ossip: Again, our win rates remained very strong. We believe we have a clear differentiation in terms of technology in market. In terms of that particular competitor, they still have separation of data, of systems, of process, of use cases between time and pay. And unless you bring those together, I don't think you can deliver a modern experience to your customers and to their employees. 
Jeremy Johnson: Next question comes from the line of Yao Chew at Crédit Suisse. 
Yaoxian Chew: Again, great to see execution. I had a question around capital allocation. Given the success of the M&A you've done with RITEQ and Excelity, do you think this current environment opens up more potential M&A opportunities? And is this the right time to be more opportunistic, especially in areas where there's dedicated growth efforts either in enterprise or overseas? 
David Ossip: That's actually a great question, and thank you for asking. It's something that we debate internally all the time, that we know that we have about a 3%, 4% market share in major markets and much less than that in terms of enterprise and global. And so just staying true to our current growth strategies, which again are acquiring new customers, going back to the custom base and selling them additional modules, moving into the enterprise space, extending into global where we have native payroll and we have the Excelity APJ pieces and then going into adjunct markets like the Dayforce Wallet. Just by focusing on those 5 avenues, we can still drive tremendous growth. Sometimes, we do come across opportunities like Excelity or like RITEQ that allow us to accelerate our entrance into an emerging market, but for each of those, we have to look at it as to what else we have to give up because we don't have unlimited budget to build everything that we would like to do, increase sales and marketing expenses where we can get proper returns and do the necessary integration fees. And that's the discussions that we have internally over time. 
Yaoxian Chew: That's great. And if I can have a quick follow-up here. I wanted to clarify the comment in the letter around the 80 small market customer losses, each with fewer than 100 employees. Are these all due to customers going out of business, or any of them competitive losses? Is there any vertical or geographic exposure here? And how should we frame or think about this churn issue going forward? Are we past the worst of it? Is it isolated to the smaller customers? Just any guideposts there would be helpful. 
David Ossip: Yes. So let me just give a true kind of a -- put a proper box around this. This is in relation to Canadian Powerpay payroll customers who use Dayforce Workforce Management. So they are predominantly a Powerpay customer, typically with very few employees. And because they need time and attendance capabilities, which isn't in the Powerpay product, they use the Dayforce Workforce Management. It's those customers that we're talking about. These are the customers that were impacted most by COVID. So you're talking about the mom-and-pop shops, the very small kind of hospitality, retail outlets that simply did not survive COVID. 
Jeremy Johnson: Next question comes from the line of Scott Fletcher at CIBC. 
Scott Fletcher: Sorry. I was on mute for a second. I actually -- being close to the end of the list here, I think I've had all my questions covered off, so I'm okay. Thank you. 
Jeremy Johnson: Thank you, Scott. Next question comes from the line of Arvind Ramnani at Piper Sandler.
 I apologize. Arvind is actually not on right now. The next question comes from the line of Chris Silvestre at Veritas. 
Chris Silvestre: Thanks. I've also got my questions covered off. Thank you. 
Jeremy Johnson: We have no other questions in the queue, and that concludes the call for today. Thank you, everyone, for joining our third quarter 2020 earnings call. We look forward to talking to you soon. 
David Ossip: Thanks, everyone. Have a good night.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-08-05 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Ceridian Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
 I would now like to turn the call over to your host for today, Jeremy Johnson, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations at Ceridian. You may begin, sir. 
Jeremy Johnson: Thank you and good evening. On the call today, we have Ceridian's CEO, David Ossip; and CFO, Arthur Gitajn. Before I hand the call to David for some brief remarks, allow me to provide a disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements.
 This call may include forward-looking statements about our current and future outlook, guidance, plans, expectations and intentions, results, levels of activities, performance, goals or achievements or any other future events or developments. These statements are based on management's reasonable assumptions and beliefs in light of information currently available to us. Listeners are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements.
 Each forward-looking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements. We refer you to our previous filings with the SEC for information regarding the significant assumptions underlying forward-looking statements and certain risks and other factors that could affect our future performance and ability to deliver on these statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements made on this call, except as may be required by law.
 The second quarter stockholder letter, earnings release and quarterly report on Form 10-Q have been furnished or filed with the SEC and will be available on the SEC's EDGAR database in the U.S. and the SEDAR database in Canada as well as on the Ceridian Investor Relations website at investors.ceridian.com.
 With that, I will turn the call over to David. 
David Ossip: Thanks, Jeremy. Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining our earnings call. I hope everyone is staying healthy and safe during this time of uncertainty.
 Before we go to Q&A, I want to spend a few minutes on some important points from our stockholder letter. First, we had a strong quarter. Despite COVID-19 headwinds, Dayforce recurring revenue ex float on a constant currency basis grew by 24.2%. In addition, Cloud recurring services gross margin increased by 140 basis points to 70.7%, and excluding float revenue, it expanded by 360 basis points.
 Second, we continue to see strong demand for Dayforce. Sales in the second quarter increased year-over-year, and it was our best second quarter in our history. Sales momentum and pipeline has accelerated, and we expect sales in the third quarter to also be a record-setting quarter and in line with our pre-COVID-19 growth targets.
 Third, Dayforce Wallet was launched in the second quarter, and it's going well. We have over 40 customers piloting the Dayforce Wallet and have over 100 more who have signed and are ready for implementation. While it's too early to disclose specific metrics, we are pleased with the product and confident in the business model.
 I would now like to hand it back to the operator to open the call up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho Group. 
Michael Berg: This is Michael Berg on for Siti. Congrats on a great quarter. I wanted to ask real quick. I saw you had some nice new additions this quarter, actually increased from Q1. And you mentioned that Q3 is -- correct me if I'm wrong, is on pace for a record new bookings quarter. So how can we expect in terms of net new additions trending from here on for the rest of the year? Is it going to be close to the pre-COVID levels of 150 to 200 new adds? And what are the size of those new customers? Are they larger or increased revenues? Looking at your 13% increase in Dayforce revenue per customer in trailing 12 months, I'm wondering if that applies to your new customers as well. 
David Ossip: Yes. So Mike, let me answer the last question. Yes, it does. The incremental revenue per new client went up by 68% in the quarter. So we're very pleased with that. So I would expect in Q3 to see the trend continue, where the trailing 12-month Dayforce revenue per client will continue to increase.
 As to the start of your first question, in terms of the number of adds, as you know, it fluctuates quarter-to-quarter. I would look at Q3 and Q4 probably combined, but more so, I would look at the product of the number of adds multiplied by the incremental Dayforce revenue per client, which obviously we would expect to go up. 
Michael Berg: All right. That helps clarify it. And then a quick follow-up. Is there anything competitively or -- just in the market in general for new business that you feel like will be key to point out? Any color or commentary on just the market, in general, you're seeing and for pipeline volume? 
David Ossip: As I pointed out, our shift to digital marketing has worked very well for us. We've seen attendance at our virtual summits go up 2x year-over-year. As I mentioned, we're very confident on Q3, and we expect Q3 sales to be in line with our targets that we set at the beginning of the year before COVID began. So there's obviously been an acceleration of sales pipeline and momentum with inside the business. I would say that we're doing quite well competitively. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin. 
Bryan Bergin: I wanted to ask about implementation pace. So can you give us a sense how the pace of the pipeline and the signings is converting to implementation in live clients? Curious if you're seeing any material deferrals by some signed clients. And really just how the behavior has changed from, let's say, April, May to kind of July? 
David Ossip: So as mentioned in the shareholder letter, clients continue to go live. And obviously, we're very pleased with that. In terms of how bookings translate into revenue, generally, it takes us about 6 to 9 months from time of contract signing before we take the customer live and we start to begin recognizing recurring revenue on those accounts.
 In terms of the trends that we've seen in the market, I would say that at the very start of COVID, there were -- a lot of companies were distracted in moving to work-from-home environment. And so we saw some delays, and we saw utilization levels go down within the quarter basically in response to that.
 When I look towards Q3 and Q4, I would say that our implementation and professional servicepeople are working tremendously hard and doing great work. And we're confident they'll get the customers live. 
Bryan Bergin: Okay. And then as far as retention, can you just give us some color there? Are you seeing any notable changes in enterprises that are going away? Or has it been still relatively sticky there? 
David Ossip: It's been very sticky. We'll report the retention rates at the end of the year. But we haven't seen any material change or negative change in terms of retention on the Dayforce side. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And there are no questions in queue. And thank you for joining today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-06 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Ceridian First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jeremy Johnson, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations at Ceridian. Thank you, sir. Please begin. 
Jeremy Johnson: Thank you, and good evening. On the call today, we have Ceridian's CEO, David Ossip; and CFO, Arthur Gitajn. 
 Today, we are going to modify the format of our call from what we have previously done. As you likely saw, we posted a stockholder letter, along with our press release and 10-Q. The stockholder letter has all of the key highlights we would have previously provided in our prepared remarks on our quarterly earnings call. We will not read the stockholder letter on this call. Instead, after some brief remarks from David, we plan to move directly to Q&A. 
 Before we begin, however, allow me to provide a disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements. This call may include forward-looking statements about our current and future outlook, guidance, plans, expectations and intentions, results, levels of activity, performance, goals or achievements or any other future events or developments. These statements are based on management's reasonable assumptions and beliefs in light of information currently available to us. Listeners are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements. 
 Each forward-looking statement is subject to risks and uncertainty that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements. We refer you to our previous filings with the SEC for information regarding the significant assumptions underlying forward-looking statements and certain risks and other factors that could affect our future performance and ability to deliver on these statements. We undertake no obligation to update or to revise any forward-looking statements made on this call, except as may be required by law. 
 The first quarter stockholder letter, earnings release and quarterly report on Form 10-Q have been furnished or filed with the SEC and will be available in the SEC EDGAR database in the U.S. and the SEDAR database in Canada, as well as on the Ceridian Investor Relations website at investors.ceridian.com. 
 And with that, I'll turn over the call to David. 
David Ossip: Thanks, Jeremy. Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining our earnings call. I hope everyone is staying healthy and safe during this time of uncertainty. 
 Before we go to Q&A, I want to spend a few minutes on some important points from our stockholder letter. First, we had a strong quarter. Dayforce revenue, excluding float and on a constant currency basis, grew by 31.9% as compared to 25.3% in the same period last year. Cloud recurring services gross margin increased by 2.5% to 72.6% and in Cloud professional services and other, gross margin improved by 10.8% to negative 3.4%. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 40 basis points year-over-year to 24.8%. 
 Second, Dayforce continues to see strong demand. We have moved to virtual summits and more digital marketing activities, and pipeline has grown. Based on what we've seen, our virtual marketing methods have expanded our ability to reach potential customers. 
 Third, we are continuing to sell Dayforce in this economic environment. In our stockholder letter, we highlighted a number of wins during the third quarter as well as the momentum we continue to see in April. In the first 4 months of 2020, we had sales across the globe, including in North America, U.K., Australia, Germany and Mauritius. 
 Fourth, the demand for Dayforce Wallet is meeting our expectations. We launched dayforcewallet.com, and the launch comes at a time when we believe workers need it most. We have a broad spectrum of customers across industries looking to implement Dayforce Wallet to support their work during this unprecedented time. On April 9, we activated our first customer, Danone. We will provide updates on Dayforce Wallet usage in future quarters, and we continue to expect to have more than 100 organizations live by the end of the year. 
 Finally, we announced an agreement to acquire Excelity. Building on our recent investments in Australia and New Zealand, we believe that this acquisition, which is expected to close in the second quarter, will position Ceridian as a leading HCM provider in the Asia Pacific region. Excelity works with more than 300 clients, which produces than 1.2 million payslips and operates its major payroll platform in 13 countries, including India, China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, Australia and New Zealand. This acquisition provides us an opportunity to land and expand in the Asia Pacific region, accelerating market presence and pave the way to extend the Dayforce native payroll platform to the Asia Pacific region. 
 In addition to the Excelity acquisition, we began development of major payroll engines for Germany, Mexico and Mauritius, which are expected to be completed in the next 18 months. 
 I would now like to hand it back to the operator to open the call for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Daniel Jester with Citi. 
Daniel Jester: Great. Hope everyone is safe and healthy. So on Dayforce specifically, can you just comment a little bit more about sort of the pipeline building efforts? I know in your shareholder letter, you talked a little bit about what you're seeing in April, but maybe can you dive in a little bit more and talk about what you and your customers are talking about and how that pipeline building is going? 
David Ossip: So thanks for the -- Daniel, thanks for the question. Look, in Q1, we saw, obviously, very strong Dayforce revenue growth. As mentioned, Dayforce recurring grew by 30.4% on a constant currency ex-float basis. The Dayforce total revenue grew by 31.9%, ex-float and on a constant currency basis. 
 In the first quarter, we continued to see sales towards the end of March. And as mentioned, and as outlined in the stockholder letter, we will continue to see sales in the month of April. We're seeing sales really across the industry, obviously, a little bit more impacted in the hospitality and the retail area. But other than that, it appears that there is still strong demand for human capital management solutions. 
Daniel Jester: Great. And then on the acquisition that you announced today, those are a lot of countries. Beyond sort of the few countries that you talked about building native payroll for, how do you see this transition happening? And then you've got both the acquisition you made last year and this new acquisition. Can you just frame how we should be thinking about how this could -- the moving pieces over the next year or 2 for all these different countries you're moving into? 
David Ossip: Sure. So Daniel, we've spoken a lot about this in the past. Our goal is to be in more than 20 countries with native payroll engines within the next few years. And so this acquisition, obviously, is very consistent with that. Excelity positions us as a leading provider in the APJ region almost immediately. It is also consistent with what we've spoken about from an M&A strategy, which is effectively to seek out players in particular regions, to acquire effectively around 2 to 3x the multiple of revenue and over a period of time, leverage their know-how and their market presence to accelerate the launch of native Dayforce into those particular regions. So on a several year basis, you'll see the extension of Dayforce into those regions, obviously, with the full HCM suite capacity. 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Robert Baird. 
Mark Marcon: Congratulations. Hope everyone's safe. With regards to -- it's obviously early in April, but can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in your client base, the existing client base, just in terms of the number of employees that they're laying off or furloughing, and how, from a temporary perspective, we should think about the impact of that, both in terms of like is there a difference between a furlough versus a layoff? And how we should think about base subscription fees versus a direct PEPM relationship? 
David Ossip: Thanks a lot, Mark. So I'm going to break it up into Dayforce and into Powerpay separately. Just as a reminder, Powerpay accounts for a little bit less than 10% of total revenue. 
 On the Dayforce side, we get paid for both active and inactive employees. Furloughed employees count as inactive employees. And so we still do receive the recurring revenue on furloughed employees. In the stockholder letter, we provided quite a lot of detail. We explained that up to April 15, the employees part of Dayforce systems had increased 17% year-over-year, but it was 5% less than the amount that we had expected at the beginning of the year. When I look at the employee count, and we monitor these obviously on a daily basis, it appears that beyond the Dayforce side and on the Powerpay side, it looks like the layoffs or the furloughing of employees has really flattened out, and we've seen a little bit of increases over the last week on both of the actual products. So on the Dayforce side, we're impacted only when employees get terminated, not when they get furloughed. 
 On the Powerpay side, slightly different. We get paid on a per paycheck basis. About 40% of the Powerpay revenue is recurring. The other 60% is early monthly fees that is not dependent on headcount. Up until April 15, we've seen a 13% decline in terms of headcount. So we're more impacted on Powerpay. But again, Powerpay accounts for just less than 10% of the revenue. 
Mark Marcon: That's great. And then with regards to just the wallet, it sounds like that's going really well. Can you elaborate a little bit more in terms of the latest thoughts in terms of how the business model's going to work from a revenue recognition perspective and what take-up's going to be like within the clients and what you've seen internally with your own workforce? 
David Ossip: So again, very early days, given that we just took live the first customer, Danone, on April 9. We spent effectively the first quarter getting ready for launch, and that's not only the product with all of the marketing, assets and implementation assets as well. We have a backlog of clients that are waiting now to go live with wallet. We waited really until the 1st of April because of some of the quarter end processes we wanted to get through. And then there was a slight delay in getting the apps published on the Google App Store and on the Apple App Store, but the application can now be downloaded in the U.S. on both of those. 
 The reaction from our own employees, who've been using the system, is very, very positive. It's a very clean experience in terms of activating the wallet. Very similar to the Dayforce app. When you download the Dayforce Wallet, it's almost like if you have Facebook and you load Instagram, it shares the same type of authentication method and such. So it's really very easy to use. The -- we do personalization of the actual plastic, which comes and looks really, really sharp. And then we also have the touch-less capability through either the phone or if you have an Apple Watch and such. The reactions have been very, very positive. 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. 
Raimo Lenschow: I hope you guys stayed safe. Can you just -- the one thing that was a focus for you guys in recent quarters was to kind of highlight the strength you have with continuous payroll around the integration or, like, time and attendance and payroll. And there you had some very interesting wins in the U.K., for example, with the coffee chain, et cetera, like the rural industries that have hourly workers. And so now that                 the screens that came up, like, what's your footprint there in terms of your pipeline for the current customers? Does that kind of create a bigger impact for you compared to other HR players? Or is it that just like a growth opportunity, and the customers that you guys have is much more broad-based? Maybe just give us some color on that because that would help us a lot. 
David Ossip: I'm sorry, Raimo. Are you asking what percentage of employees we have in a certain industry? Or...what exactly are you asking? 
Raimo Lenschow: Yes, yes. It's for -- if you look at -- yes. Wherever you're in an installed base. And if you look at the pipeline, like, was that kind of -- because you've talked a lot about it, but it doesn't mean that they all have to be in that space. But a little bit more color there. 
David Ossip: I'm still -- I'm not following. So what exactly is the question? 
Raimo Lenschow: Yes. The breakdown of the customer base, as far as you can give it to us in the installed base, but also in the pipeline. 
David Ossip: So mostly, the pipeline obviously has shifted. So it's not going to be reflective of historical sales. We obviously are spending much more effort now in developing pipeline in what we term surge industries. And we're still seeing growth in many of those industries. When it comes to the actual historical, Jeremy can correct me, but I believe probably about 14%. Is that correct, Jeremy, of the employee base would be in kind of I'll call it, retail or hospitality that would be impacted by COVID. We do have a larger footprint in retail, but those would be in groceries and such, some fast food that haven't already been impacted. Even across the retail group, we haven't seen massive layoffs. We've seen furloughed employees. And as you know, we do get paid for those furloughed employees. 
Raimo Lenschow: Okay, that's really helpful. Okay, that's really helpful. And then maybe a follow-up like on float. If you think in                 like, obviously, the                 came down. Like can you remind us of how your investment on the float side is structured at the moment, and how that might change with the current, kind of rate environment? 
David Ossip: Sure. The way we do the float is we effectively break it up between a core portfolio and a liquidity portfolio. In the liquidity portfolio, we basically keep the money in overnight. And in the core portfolio, we obviously use a laddering strategy. So you're typically, an average life of about 2.5 to 3 years. The -- just the impact of the change in the Fed rate, as you know, has gone down by about 150 basis points, about 25 basis points. On a full year basis, that's an $18 million headwind for us. We aren't -- obviously, we can't do much changes between how we do the investments as the trust funds are AAA-rated. That's the point system that we have to use investment side. So that effectively determines what percent of your government and what types of corps we're allowed to invest in. 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with RBC. 
Robert Simmons: This is Robert Simmons on for Alex. Can you give us some color around how your bookings trended from mid-March through now either compared to planned or on a year-over-year basis? 
David Ossip: So Robert. No, we actually don't provide details actually to quarterly sales or to pipeline sales. Obviously, there has been some impact. But as I mentioned, we continue to see momentum. 
Robert Simmons: Got it. And then can you talk about what you're seeing in the competitive landscape? Are you seeing anything unusual to call out from competitors, you being more aggressive on price, considering how they do the market                , like that? 
David Ossip: We haven't seen any changes. 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies. 
Samad Samana: I hope everybody is doing well. David, maybe first question. Just in the shareholder letter, I saw the comment about rolling in more minimums into the contracts. Could you maybe remind us what the current minimum threshold is on average for the customer base and how that currently works? And then I have one follow-up. 
David Ossip: Sure. One -- in current contracts, there is no minimum. We charge on the number of active and inactive employees, typically on the 15th of the month. And we charge 1 month in advance. So we are making some changes to contracting going forward, to provide a minimum, which is obviously a percentage of the employees at time of contracting. 
Samad Samana: Great. Very helpful. And then maybe just on the Bureau business. I know there are plans to maybe accelerate some of the -- the end of lifing. Obviously, payroll departments are dealing with a lot of challenges right now. I'm curious if you're seeing customers accelerate the shift off of Bureau and maybe increasingly going to Dayforce? Or what are your plans on the Bureau side? And how is that benefiting or impacting Dayforce? 
David Ossip: Again, the strategy on Bureau hasn't changed. As you know, we aggressively are now trying to end of life the Bureau products with the exception of the tax. Tax is probably about a $50 million business of the remaining Bureau. Every quarter, we move around about $5 million from Bureau to Dayforce, and then there's probably an equal amount that just goes away as we don't really have a home for it in the Dayforce type of world. There hasn't been any change to each of the pace of approaching customers or the pace of us end of lifing. But as we mentioned prior, by the end of the year, we already expect the aggregate business to be -- and Jeremy can kind of provide updates, but probably under $100 million. 
Jeremy Johnson: That's exactly right. And $5.8 million was the Bureau impact this month, which is right in line with that kind of $5 million to $6 million that we've been talking about every quarter. 
Samad Samana: Okay, great. And we appreciate the 2Q guidance and how resilient the business is. 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Scott Berg with Needham. 
Joshua Reilly: This is Josh on for Scott. Do you anticipate any impact to your partner strategy upmarket from COVID-19 given that was just getting launched for new business in 2021? Or do these relationships remain on track? 
David Ossip: If anything, there's an opportunity to lean in and strengthen these types of relationships. So in one way, it allows us to basically, in professional services, rely much more on taxing through the use of a larger size as opposed to hiring directly professional services people. 
Joshua Reilly: Okay, great. And then just a follow-up. Do you expect any delayed impact to business trends in Canada, given that they implemented social distancing after the United States, which has implications for their curve of infection rate? 
David Ossip: I honestly don't see much of a difference between the U.S. and Canada. I'm not sure who actually did social distancing first. I can't remember it. As an organization, we probably did a few weeks ahead of both the U.S. and Canada. What I'll point out again is that our business is largely non-touch. From a sales perspective, from a marketing perspective, implementation, customer support, all of that, even in times of non-COVID, is usually done on a non-touch basis. So it doesn't really make much of a difference. 
 As I mentioned beforehand, we monitor the employee headcount at all of our customers. And when I look at both Canada and the U.S., we've seen a slight increase in employees and customers over the last week. So nothing really to get overly excited about, but there seems to be evidence that the impact of COVID has kind of bottomed out. 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. 
Bryan Bergin: Hope you're all doing well. I wanted to ask on implementations. Can you give us a sense of the mix of customers that might be delaying implementations here? And then any difference in the behavior of the clients that have already started implementations as far as pauses or whether most are still moving forward? 
David Ossip: Look, it's a mix. If I look at the impact of implementations in Q1, remember, your credit risk [ temporarily ] during the period that we typically would take live all of the customers from Q1. The overall impact of COVID in Q1 was probably about $1 million to $2 million in terms of the amount of recurring revenue we would have activated in that particular quarter. So there was some impact, but it definitely wasn't a material amount. We did also see some of the kickoffs of new projects get pushed a little bit, but we're confident that they'll get restarted relatively soon if they haven't been restarted already. 
 In terms of the impact from the industry, obviously, it's probably in line with what you would expect. It was a specialty retail -- retailer, it probably was more impacted than, say, if it was an extended care living facility. 
Bryan Bergin: Okay. And then as far as the demand environment, can you comment on just buying behavior you might be seeing between -- for Dayforce, between major markets and enterprise customers? And any modules or functionalities within the existing base that are seeing increasing uptake as a result of this? 
David Ossip: Yes, yes. So let me just add another step that I actually mentioned before. 88% of Dayforce employees are at customers above 500 employees. The vast majority of Dayforce accounts really would be in major markets or in enterprise. I haven't really seen a material difference between behaviors between major markets and enterprise. Now that may be because we have moved upmarket quite significantly over the last year. And you see that in some of the numbers we spoke about in the stockholder letter. For instance, the incremental revenue per Dayforce account increased 63% to $213,196 from $130,998 a year before. So most of our -- obviously, a larger proportion of our customers will be towards the upper end of major markets in the enterprise side. 
Bryan Bergin: Okay. Anything on the functionality difference? 
David Ossip: No, not really at all as far as I can see. 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. 
Matthew Coss: This is Matt Coss on behalf of Mark Murphy. David, you said that furloughing of employees seems to have stabilized, and some have even come back. What is your sense for how many furloughed employees might eventually come back -- or excuse me, terminated employees might eventually return to a full-time position based on conversations with your customers? 
David Ossip: Look, hey Mark (sic) [Matt], and nice to hear from you. I don't have the answer to that. In terms of furloughed employees, again, we get paid for furloughed employees. What I can say is when I look at furloughed employees versus active employees at our customer base, the percentage of furloughed employees seems to be going down. So there seems to be a movement in our customer base in activating inactive employees. In terms of employees that they have let go, I don't know what -- if they will come back to the levels they had previously, but I think we'll probably get a bit more clarity over the next 6 months or so. 
Matthew Coss: Okay. And you also mentioned the sales cycle had extended in some cases. And are those cases mostly in the heavily impacted industry? And if the sales cycle are extending, are they sort of -- are some of these deals off the table? Or are they just going to come later? What is your sense for how many will ultimately return to you? 
David Ossip: Sure. So there's a few questions in there. First, we've seen very few projects get canceled. The pattern seems to be that there's a push into later quarters. In terms of industry, I don't know if that was the primary reason for pushes. I believe that in the end of March, it was effectively everyone's getting ready to work from home and some organizations like us has the maturity and has policy to make it very easy, others didn't. And so the same people that would have made decisions on systems like ours were quite busy in helping their employees get productive and get up to speed from working from home. At the moment, I think there's kind of a return to work effort that's going on in a lot of the clients. And that also created a little bit of distraction. But I think we're actually feeling positive that we'll go back to usual sales cycle, and I'm very encouraged by the, kind of the volume and the momentum of sales that we saw, even in the first month of this quarter. 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Stephanie Price with CIBC. 
Stephanie Price: I was just wondering whether customers have been requesting any new functionality or solution sets in the current environments and whether you're seeing any interest in add-on sales as customer needs change. 
David Ossip: Great question. So we were quite proactive in this. So very early on in COVID, we made some enhancements to the Dayforce product. The first was we added a COVID tracker, which effectively allows employees to register which offices they've been to. And then if there is a suspected case of COVID or positive case of COVID, our system can generate a list of people who may have come into contact with the person. And we also enhanced the messaging engine to make it easy to be broadcast via SMS or personal e-mail, so that people could get notified in a very efficient manner. 
 The second thing we did is that we loaded into learning management system a lot of information around COVID. So how do you work from home? How do you manage employees at home? How do you stay safe? How do you wash your hands? And other pieces of really important information. And we added that to all Dayforce instances whether people had the learning management system or not. And we also launched or we activated a public version of Dayforce Learning. That's available for any organization to use. They can just simply go on, register, load their employees and such, and that provides all the COVID pieces. In the near term, you'll see us launch a lot of kind of features and communications about return to work and about helping companies prepare to get people back into the offices and as such. 
 In terms of add-on sales, as you know, add-on sales has always been 20% of what we sell. Obviously, there is a strong demand for learning management. There's obviously -- the other pieces of the application do apply quite nicely in this environment. 
Stephanie Price: Great. And then just one more for me on the M&A outlook. So congrats on the Excelity acquisition. Just wondering if you've seen -- what you're seeing in the M&A market right now, if you've seen any impact of valuations or the number of prospects that are out there. 
David Ossip: We're quite laser-focused when we try to do these things. We have started to work on Excelity in 2019. And yes, COVID obviously did have some impact to timing, but I can't say that I've actually seen any real change in M&A activity in the marketplace. 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Crédit Suisse. 
Yaoxian Chew: This is Yao Chew on for Brad Zelnick. I hope everyone is staying safe. Just wanted to dive a bit more into the go-to-market strategy and sort of a 2-part question within this. I was glad that you -- seeing how you managed to adapt to the virtual go-to-market motion with the seminars and summit, but there's always a lot of steps between the top of funnel, between website traffic and qualified leads and final implementation. It's new to everyone involved here. I guess, can you point out where the bottlenecks are, if there are any major ones to call out, and how receptive customers are to this approach? And on that, does this change any longer-term views on traditional go-to-market given the new resources and ROI or effectiveness that you may be seeing here? 
David Ossip: Yes. Look, as you can probably gather from the stockholder letter or even from today's talk, we've been chosen to lean in into the current environment to strengthen our organization. And in terms of marketing, we moved very quickly to more of a digital marketing focus. And we started off with our first virtual summit, which effectively had about 2, 3x the attendance that we typically would see on physical. And the reactions we got from it was very positive. And so from that, we obviously extended that. We did one in Australia. We did one in the U.K. We did another one in North America last week. I believe we have one coming up in the U.K. and Ireland in a couple of weeks. And we seem to be able to come up with a format that's very engaging. This one involves customer speakers. We did a very thorough demonstration of the actual product. We answered questions live. We still do now virtual one-on-ones with prospective customers and such, and it seems to be going very nicely. 
 The second part about the digital marketing is that because we really are experts when it comes to payroll and tax. And as you know, with the various government programs in the U.S. and Canada, there's been a lot of complexity that the customers have had to have understood. And we've done a lot of very informative webinars, leveraging outside speakers and our own experts, and I think that has improved the brand of Ceridian. In other words, reinforcing how important it is to be experts and be able to do the compliance calculations correctly and have the internal compliance teams that really can help customers adjust as they need to, to remain compliant and to help their employees. Lastly, I think that the Dayforce Wallet launch comes really at a great time. We're now living in a world where people really would like to do touchless transactions. They really do need to be able to get their earned wages as quickly as possible. And having a mechanism that allows organizations to really get money into the hands of their employees when they need them is obviously a great feature. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO. 
Keith Bachman: I had 2 questions. The first is, when you mentioned the competitive landscape, I wanted to ask about pricing in really, in 2 dimensions. Are you seeing any changes in price discovery when there's new work to be done and/or new bids out there, I meant, and/or are you seeing any customers coming back and asking for price relief, particularly in the most affected industries? So are you seeing any broad primers or any kind of changes in pricing? 
David Ossip: So I don't think we've seen any changes in pricing. And as we've mentioned, we're making some changes to future contracts in terms of adding minimums to the actual contract on a go-forward basis. In reality, the fact that we get paid for furloughed employees really has provided us with a lot of insulation from COVID. So we are quite fortunate in that regard. 
 In terms of the customers in impacted industries, we've been quite proactive. We look at our customers as very long-term partnerships, and we want to be able to support them in any way that we obviously can. So in serving industries, we did do a reach out to help them more from a financing perspective during this particular period. That's not really on a rate reduction basis. 
Keith Bachman: Okay. So maybe financing helped, okay. The second is on wallet. You did previously comment that you've had a backlog build in the very short period of time. I was just wondering if you could revisit on what you think the metrics might be for the maturing of wallet, when we might see some revenues. Previously you talked about next fiscal year, you were going to see kind of the first wallet revenues. But could you just revisit on when investors might see some of the potential of wallet? And could there indeed be some revenues as we get towards the end of this fiscal year? 
David Ossip: Well, we're doing the rollout obviously of stuff now. And as much of this stuff is obviously, are going to be activated in the second half of the year, I think that will be a fair statement. I don't think that we'll see a material impact from revenue in 2020. As we get more experience with the product, as we mentioned inside the stockholder letter, we will share that with everyone, so people can start to model. And we'll start to talk more about the business as we have for information about it. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Thank you. 
David Ossip: Thank you, everyone.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-05 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Ceridian Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

 As a reminder, all figures discussed on this conference call are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted. 
 And with that, I will turn the call over to David. 
David Ossip: Thanks, Jeremy. Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining our earnings call. We are very pleased with the results from the fourth quarter of 2019. 
 In the fourth quarter, we set new records for the value of new sales and for the value of customers taken live.  
 Dayforce total revenue grew 35% to $159 million and was up 36% on a constant currency basis. And excluding float revenue, Dayforce total revenue grew even faster, up 38% on both a GAAP basis and on a constant currency basis. 
 On the Dayforce recurring revenue side, we saw increases of 30% on both the GAAP basis and on a constant currency basis. And excluding float revenue, Dayforce recurring revenue increased by 32% on a GAAP basis and up 33% on a constant currency basis. 
 We ended the quarter with 4,363 Dayforce customers live, and global active users were up 26% to 3.9 million. Not only do we have more Dayforce customers live, but we also saw a 12% increase in the average revenue per Dayforce customer to more than $131,000 per customer. This increase was driven by success in our enterprise, major markets and global segments and add-on sale to already live customers. 
 The average deal size of a new sale in 2019 grew by 24%, driven by enterprise, where the average deal size grew by 100%. And in global sales, primarily U.K. and Australia, we saw growth of more than 150% compared to 2018. In addition, approximately 23% of our sales during 2019 were sales of additional functionality to existing customers. 
 Successful product launches include our benefit decision support module and learning management.  Benefit decision support has been sold to over 180 customers, and Dayforce learning management has been sold to over 350 customers. 
 From a profitability standpoint, we are very pleased that cloud recurring services gross margin expanded 280 basis points year-over-year to 68.8%; and professional services and other gross margin was positive, improving from a negative 10.6% in the fourth quarter of 2018 to a positive 5.9%. 
 In the fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $44.4 million, an increase of 6.2% compared to last year. 
 Moving on to product development. Our investment in product development during the fourth quarter, including research and development expense and capitalized software development, was $18.6 million or 8.4% of revenue, an increase of 33% compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. 
 As previously discussed, we accelerated Dayforce growth investments throughout 2019, and we'll continue to do so in 2020. The areas of investments include Dayforce Wallet, which will begin initial customer implementation shortly, and we expect to have several hundred customers live by year-end. 
 Another area of investment is the expanding breadth of the Dayforce offering, with new modules such as employee engagement and poll surveys, benefit Intelligence and Dayforce Hub. We already have several customers live with engagement surveys and expect strong traction across the client base. 
 And the final area of investment is building additional and major payroll engines for global markets. We currently have major payroll in 6 countries, including the U.S., Canada, U.K., Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. And we are now building native payroll for Germany, Mexico and Mauritius. We expect to have native payroll for over 20 countries within a few years. 
 In addition, we have a network of 7 global payroll partners, who provide us with coverage in 157 countries. 
 Moving on to sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses during the fourth quarter were $44.4 million or 20% of revenue, up by $8.6 million, an increase of 24%. This represents a continuation of our investments to grow and the commission from record sales in the fourth quarter. 
 In the fourth quarter, we consistently broke sales record. In October, we signed the largest revenue deal in Dayforce history for approximately 63,000 U.S. and Canadian employees, other premier Tier 1 consulting company that is moving from a legacy on-premise solution to Dayforce. 
 In December, we set another new record for the largest revenue deal in Dayforce history, when we won a popular quick-service restaurant with over 2,400 locations and about 140,000 employees. The company was using legacy homegrown systems and wanted to enhance its flexibility, capabilities and efficiencies for core HR, time, payroll and talent with a single cloud platform for its entire HCM suite. 
 Dayforce will bring the company's key HCM components into a single platform, while providing the flexibility to integrate with their other strategic systems. Additionally, Dayforce will consolidate HR functionality for all its restaurant locations, allowing the company to increase efficiency and improve engagement throughout its workforce, while helping to maintain compliance and mitigate risk. 
 In addition to these 2 record wins, we also had many other successes, such as 2 large amusement park operators, one in the U.S. with more than 50,000 seasonal employees and the other in the U.K. with more than 5,500 employees, a large manufacturer of integrated plastics with more than 7,000 employees, a healthcare management company with nearly 5,000 employees and a specialty food business with more than 5,000 employees. 
 Before I turn the call over to Arthur, I want to discuss some personnel changes we are making as we continue to optimize our organizational structure to support the aggressive growth targets we have for our global organization.
 We promoted Chris Armstrong to lead our Global Customer Office, as Chief Customer Officer, reporting to our President and COO, Leagh Turner. In this capacity, Chris will take on additional responsibilities, including implementation, professional services, customer support, back-office operations and customer relationships. 
 I will now turn it over to Arthur to discuss our financial results and guidance with you in greater detail. 
Arthur Gitajn: Thank you, David, and good evening, everyone. I'm going to take a few minutes to talk about our fourth quarter 2019 financial results then I'm going to provide some highlights on our full year 2019 financial results. And finally, I'll provide guidance for the first quarter of 2020 and the full year. 
 Starting with our fourth quarter 2019 financial results. Revenue from our flagship cloud HCM platform Dayforce increased by $41.5 million or 35.4% to $158.7 million. On a constant currency basis, Dayforce revenue increased 35.7%. 
 Revenue from Powerpay, our cloud HR and payroll solution for the Canadian small business market, declined by 0.8% to $25.5 million. On a constant currency basis, Powerpay revenue declined 1.5%. The year-over-year decline is primarily due to higher Powerpay revenue in the fourth quarter of 2018. As we spoke about last year, fourth quarter 2018 Powerpay revenue benefited from the fact that December 31, 2018, was a Monday and a number of customers processed their first 2019 payroll in 2018. 
 Cloud revenue, which includes both Dayforce and Powerpay, increased by $41.3 million or 28.9% to $184.2 million. On a constant currency basis, Cloud revenue also increased 28.9%. And total revenue, which includes revenue from both our Cloud and Bureau solutions, increased by $27 million or 13.9% to $221.8 million, and on a constant currency basis, total revenue increased 13.8%.
 Our guidance for 2019 assumed a U.S. dollar to Canadian dollar exchange rate of CAD 1.30. The Canadian dollar weakened against the U.S. dollar during the fourth quarter, and the average exchange rate for the quarter was CAD 1.32. Even with the weaker Canadian dollar, which had the effect of reducing cloud revenue by $1.1 million, Cloud revenue exceeded the high end of our $180 million to $183 million guidance range by $1.3 million. And on a constant currency basis, Cloud revenue exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $2.4 million. 
 Total revenue exceeded the high end of our $216 million to $219 million guidance range by $3.2 million and by $4.4 million on a constant currency basis. An adjusted EBITDA of $44.4 million came in right in the middle of our $42 million to $47 million guidance range. 
 Cloud revenue in the fourth quarter was driven by a 23.2% increase in Cloud recurring services revenue and a 50.7% increase in Cloud professional services and other revenue. Of the $41.3 million increase in total Cloud revenue, $5.3 million or 13% was attributable to Bureau customers migrating to Dayforce. Excluding the impact of migrations to Dayforce, revenue from Bureau solutions declined by $9 million or 17.3%, which was in line with our expectations. 
 Cloud revenue accounted for 83% of our total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 73% in the fourth quarter of 2018. The average float balance for our customer trust funds during the fourth quarter was approximately $3.14 billion compared to $3.08 billion in the fourth quarter last year. The average yield on our float balance was 2.18% during the fourth quarter of 2019, a decline of 8 basis points compared to the average yield in the fourth quarter of 2018. As a result, income from invested customer trust funds was $17.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to $17.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. 
 The balance sheet value of customer trust funds as of December 31, 2019, was $3.2 billion compared to $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2018. 
 We continue to expand our gross margins during the fourth quarter. While Cloud recurring services revenue grew $26.2 million or 23.2%, our cost of Cloud recurring services to support this growth increased by only $5 million or 13%, and our gross margin on Cloud recurring services increased from 66% in the fourth quarter last year to 68.8%, reflecting an increase in the proportion of Dayforce customers live for more than 2 years from 63% in the fourth quarter last year to 69% and also our ability to continue to realize economies of scale in customer support and hosting costs. 
 Our gross margin on professional services and other revenue improved from negative 10.6% in the fourth quarter last year to a positive 5.9%, due to productivity improvements in implementing new customers, reflecting the increased experience of our implementation consultants and the continued use of automation in our implementation processes. 
 Activations increased to $26.4 million or 59% of cloud professional services and other costs in the fourth quarter compared to $15.7 million or 53% of cloud professional services and other costs in the fourth quarter last year. And post go-live professional services costs increased to $10.5 million compared to $8.1 million in the fourth quarter last year. We continued to invest in research and development and in sales and marketing to support long-term growth in Dayforce. 
 Product development and management expenses increased by $3.1 million or 19.7% to $18.8 million. In addition, capitalized software development costs increased by $3.2 million from $5.9 million in the fourth quarter last year to $9.1 million. 
 Sales and marketing expenses increased $8.6 million or 24% to $44.4 million, and sales and marketing expenses as a percent of revenue increased from 18.4% to 20%. 
 G&A expenses increased $3.8 million to $33.7 million, primarily attributable to increased share-based compensation of $3.3 million. 
 Adjusted EBITDA increased by $2.6 million or 6.2% to $44.4 million. And adjusted EBITDA margin percentage declined approximately 150 basis points from 21.5% to 20%, primarily due to the decline in float revenue growth and investments in sales and marketing. 
 Turning now to our full year 2019 financial results. Revenue from our flagship cloud HCM platform, Dayforce increased by $132.2 million or 30.2% to $569.7 million. On a constant currency basis, Dayforce revenue increased 30.9%. Revenue from Powerpay, our cloud HR and payroll solution for the Canadian small business market, declined by 1.1% to $90.3 million. On a constant currency basis, Powerpay revenue increased 1.1%. 
 Cloud revenue, which includes both Dayforce and Powerpay, increased by $131.2 million or 24.8% to $660 million. And on a constant currency basis, Cloud revenue increased 25.7%.
 And total revenue, which includes revenue from both our Cloud and Bureau solutions, increased by $83.4 million or 11.3% to $824.1 million. And on a constant currency basis, total revenue increased 12.1%. 
 Cloud annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, which includes the full year impact of customers who went live during 2019, was $582 million at the end of 2019, up $105.8 million or 22.2% from annualized recurring revenue in 2018. 
 Annual cloud revenue retention was 96.3% in 2019 compared to 96.0% in 2018. We continued to expand margins during 2019. Our gross margin on Cloud recurring services increased from 66.1% in 2018 to 69.6%, and our gross margin on professional services and other improved from negative 14.3% in 2018 to a negative 4.0% in 2019.
 Adjusted EBITDA increased by $24 million or 15% to $184.6 million, and adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 70 basis points to 22.4% in 2019. Adjusted diluted net income per share of $0.46 for 2019 increased 76.9% year-over-year. 
 Moving to the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $281.3 million, an increase of $63.5 million compared to December 31, 2018. And our total debt was $677.1 million as of December 31, 2019, an increase of $6.8 million, primarily due to financing lease obligations of $12.4 million in 2019. 
 Our net leverage ratio was 2.1x as of December 31, 2019 compared to 2.8x as of December 31, 2018. 
 Our capital expenditures in 2019 were $55.2 million compared to $40.2 million in 2018. Included in the $55.2 million in capital expenditures were $16.3 million for property and equipment and $38.9 million for software and technology, of which $32.6 million was capitalized software development, an increase of $7.3 million compared to 2018. 
 Turning now to our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2020, I want to highlight 2 assumptions underlying our guidance. First, our guidance assumes no changes in the U.S. federal funds rates or the Bank of Canada rates during 2020. So any Fed funds or Bank of Canada changes during the year will impact our guidance. 
 For reference, based on current investment practices, a 100 basis point change in market investment rates would affect float revenue by approximately $18 million over the 12 months following the rate change. Second, to simplify reporting as we expand globally, beginning with the first quarter of 2020, we're changing the way we report the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our revenue results. Instead of recalculating revenue on a constant currency basis using a fixed foreign exchange rate for all periods presented, which was $1 to CAD 1.30 in 2019, we will calculate constant currency growth rates using the average exchange rates in effect during the applicable comparable prior period.  Please note that this change does not impact disclosures for 2019, and 2019 disclosures on a constant currency basis reflect USD 1 to CAD 1.30. 
 As it relates to guidance, we'll be issuing guidance based on the average foreign exchange rates during the most recent fiscal quarter reported. In subsequent periods, we'll update our guidance based on the average foreign exchange rates during the most recent fiscal quarter reported and will disclose the impact of any change in guidance related to foreign exchange fluctuations. So our full year and first quarter 2020 guidance reflects foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the fourth quarter of 2019, which was USD 1 to CAD 1.32.
 Now moving to the full year 2020 guidance. We expect Dayforce revenue of $708 million to $713 million, an increase of approximately 24% to 25% on both the GAAP basis and the constant currency basis.  Excluding float revenue, Dayforce revenue is expected to grow approximately 27% to 28% on both the GAAP basis and the constant currency basis. 
 We expect Cloud revenue of $800 million to $805 million or an increase of approximately 21% to 22% on both the GAAP basis and the constant currency basis. Excluding float revenue, Cloud revenue is expected to grow approximately 24% on a GAAP basis and approximately 24% to 25% on a constant currency basis. 
 We expect total revenue of $903 million to $908 million or an increase of approximately 10% on both the GAAP basis and the constant currency basis. Excluding float revenue, total revenue is expected to grow approximately 12% to 13% on both the GAAP basis and the constant currency basis. 
 We expect total float revenue of $70 million in 2020, which would represent a decline of $10.2 million compared to 2019 float revenue. Of the total $70 million in 2020 float revenue, approximately $50 million will be reflected in Dayforce revenue and a total of $62 million will be reflected in Cloud revenue. 
 Reflecting investments to drive future growth, including the Dayforce Wallet, acceleration in the enterprise segment and expansion globally, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be $185 million to $190 million or an increase of 0% to 3%. Excluding float revenue, adjusted EBITDA is expected to grow approximately 10% to 15%. 
 For those of you modeling earnings per share, we expect net interest expense of approximately $30 million for the year or approximately $7 million to $8 million per quarter. 
 Total depreciation and amortization of approximately $50 million for the year; an effective tax rate of 40% to 45%, which reflects our U.S. statutory federal and state rate of approximately 27%, plus the estimated impact of the new base erosion anti-abuse tax and diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 153 million for the full year and 150 million for the first quarter. 
 For the first quarter of 2020, we expect Dayforce revenue of $166 million to $168 million or an increase of approximately 25% to 27% on both a GAAP basis and a constant currency basis. Excluding float revenue, Dayforce revenue is expected to grow approximately 29% to 30% on both a GAAP basis and a constant currency basis. We expect Cloud revenue of $188 million to $190 million or an increase of approximately 22% to 23% on both a GAAP basis and a constant currency basis. Excluding float revenue, Cloud revenue is expected to grow approximately 25% to 26% on a GAAP basis and approximately 25% to 27% on a constant currency basis. 
 We expect total revenue of $221 million to $223 million or an increase of approximately 8% to 9% on a GAAP basis and 9% to 10% on a constant currency basis. Excluding float revenue, total revenue is expected to grow approximately 11% to 13% on a GAAP basis and 12% to 13% on a constant currency basis. 
 We expect Q1 total float revenue of $21 million, of which $15 million will be reflected in Dayforce revenue and $18 million will be reflected within Cloud revenue. And we expect adjusted EBITDA of $47 million to $49 million, a decline of approximately 2% to 6%.  Excluding float revenue, adjusted EBITDA is expected to grow between 2% and 10%. 
 At this time, I'm going to hand the call back to David for some concluding remarks. 
David Ossip: Thanks, Arthur. I would like to speak about a few things before we open it up to questions. As I mentioned earlier, we accelerated the investments throughout 2019 and we'll continue to do so in 2020. While we benefited from Fed rate increases in the first 3 quarters of 2019, we anticipate a 2020 float income headwind of approximately $10 million. 
 To provide clarity around the performance of the business, we issued an 8-K in December 2019, showing our revenue results, excluding the impact of float. And as Arthur just covered, we are providing 2020 guidance with and without float income. 
 Because of float revenue flows almost directly to the bottom line, our adjusted EBITDA guidance includes the impact of the float headwind as well. Excluding float, we expect to grow adjusted EBITDA by 10% to 15% year-over-year, which at the top end of guidance is an acceleration compared to 2019. On the Bureau side, we are moving to an aggressive end-of-life strategy, and this is reflected in our $103 million guidance. 
 Finally, we are continuing investments in product development, sales and services to support the massive amount of opportunity we see in our focused areas. 
 Our growth strategy includes: first, winning more new customers in our existing markets; second, increasing our recurring revenue per client by adding functionality to the Dayforce platform; third, moving upmarket into more enterprise verticals, including retail, hospitality, manufacturing, healthcare, financial services, government and professional services; fourth, expanding globally by building major core HR, workforce management and payroll capability for more countries; and finally, extending into adjacent markets, such as Dayforce Wallet.
 Consistent with our messaging since IPO, we are confident that we will exceed $1 billion of revenue in 2021 and in the longer term, exceed adjusted EBITDA margins of 30%. 
 With that, I will ask the operator to open up the line to questions. Thank you. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nandan Amladi with Guggenheim Partners. 
Nandan Amladi: So the guidance for the Bureau of $103 million implies a pretty sharp drop off. We saw that in the fourth quarter. David, you just mentioned that you're moving towards end-of-life. How many of those customers are you able to migrate successfully? Has the cadence of that changed at all as you've moved to this more aggressive end-of-life? 
David Ossip: Well, as you can see, if you look at the amount that we've migrated from the Bureau to the Cloud has been rather constant on a dollar basis over the last 4 quarters and you'll see that continue into 2020, all right. If we look at the -- the guidance we've given for Bureau about $102 million, $103 million, with the insight that, remember, half of that is a stand-alone Cloud business, there's a small business payroll product, which is in there for between, say, $10 million and $20 million and then there are the remaining Bureau business, which accounts for the delta. So the reality is that there isn't that much left in the payroll Bureau business. And from a compliance perspective and from a maintenance perspective, it does make sense to have the aggressive end-of-life strategy. 
Nandan Amladi: Okay. And then a follow-up on the international market, this is a different topic. How different is the selling motion in the international markets that you're entering, both in terms of the size of customer you're going after, the sales cycle and so on? 
David Ossip: So the average size of the global accounts is probably a little bit larger than on average than what we see in North America. If we look at the global business, we're obviously very happy. We've seen the growth of that business grow by 150% year-over-year. 
 In terms of sales cycles, this is quite consistent to what we see in North America. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies. 
Samad Samana: So David, one of the things that, I think, based on last quarter, I think we were expecting further acceleration in Dayforce recurring revenue ex float in the fourth quarter. So I'm just curious maybe what drove that slowdown? If there was any customer timing delays, kiosk revenue had quite a jump in the fourth quarter as well. And how do we reconcile maybe just the deceleration as investments are accelerating? And how does that impact 2020 Dayforce recurring export revenue growth? I know it's a long question, but we'd love some color on it, if possible. 
David Ossip: Sure. So let's just look at the overall Dayforce business. On an ex float business, Dayforce total revenue accelerated to 37.5%. In the quarter, obviously, up quite dramatically from the 23.2% the year before. If we look at the Dayforce recurring on the ex float basis, a year ago, we were 31.1% and in Q4 of '19, we came in at 32.4%. So an acceleration year-over-year. 
 On a quarter-over-quarter basis, there are some gives and takes that get a little bit complicated from the 605 to 606 basis. Some of that you can see in, in fact, in effectively in the movement between the Dayforce professional services and as well between the Dayforce recurring. But overall, I would say we are very happy with the Dayforce recurring revenue and the Dayforce total revenue with or without float. 
Samad Samana: Great. That's helpful. And then maybe just switching gears a little bit, mentioning -- expanding hundreds of customers on the on-demand pay side, it sounds like the company is quite excited about that. How should we think about that eventually impacting the revenue results? And what expectations have you already embedded into your guidance? 
David Ossip: Yes, sure. So as we've mentioned previously, in terms of 2020, it's largely an investment year when it comes to Dayforce Wallet. If I look at it year-over-year, the investments in the Dayforce Wallets are going to be up almost $9 million, and that's reflected in the EBITDA guidance that we've given. I would expect to see the benefit from that investment dollars really come into more of the 2021 time frame, more so than the 2020.
 In terms of progress on the Dayforce Wallet, as I've mentioned, we've started implementations for the first group that will be going live just after the end of Q1. The demand for the Dayforce Wallet is exceptionally high, and I would expect us to end the year with several hundred customers live on the Dayforce Wallet. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Jester with Citi. 
Daniel Jester: Great. Maybe just a couple of quick ones for me. First, with regards to 2020 guidance, would you be able to share kind of what your expectations are for revenues from the Canadian government contract? And how we should be thinking about the cadence there, kind of any updates from the fall? 
 And then secondly, could you -- speaking to Canada, it looks like the Powerpay, the quick math that I did, it looks like you don't have a lot of growth baked in for 2020 there. So I'm just wondering if you can kind of update us for how we should be thinking about that? 
David Ossip: Sure. On the Canadian government, it's still too early to tell. As a process perspective, the team is in Ottawa this week doing the final oral presentations, and we'd expect that the government will make a decision on the first half assignment shortly. That, I believe, will be followed by several other task requirements that the government will put out to bid to the 3 qualified vendors, which includes us. 
 And in terms of Powerpay, remember that last year in Q4, we had about $1 million of processing revenue that usually would have fallen in Q1. So if we look at it from a year-over-year perspective, we had slight growth in the Powerpay business kind of consistent with what we saw in the other quarters in the actual year. In terms of next year, yes, it will be a low single-digit grower. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. 
Sitikantha Panigrahi: I just want to dig into more into the enterprise segment. Could you share the performance this quarter? And as you think about 2020, definite leverage sell-side has gone up. So what's your expectation from that segment? 
David Ossip: So overall, you can see that the average size of the customer has increased quite significantly year-over-year. If I look at the enterprise segment, specifically, the average deal size went up by about 100% year-over-year. In the quarter, we had some significant wins that aren't reflected yet in the revenue numbers. We signed a Tier 1 consulting company with over 60,000 employees. We signed a well-known quick-service restaurant with over 2,400 locations and about 140,000 employees. We signed a number of players in the amusement park industry. One of them with about 50,000 employees in total. So we've obviously done tremendously well in terms of moving up into the market. 
 When you look at the average deal size, you can see that has gone up. If I look at the average Dayforce revenue per customer, we're up 12% year-over-year. And if you look at the incremental revenue that's been added year-over-year, we're up -- last year in Q4, the average incremental revenue was $156,000 per client, and in this year, we've increased it to $209,000 per client. So going into next year, I would expect that trend to continue. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird. 
Mark Marcon: You mentioned or reiterated the $1 billion revenue target for 2021. How should we think about the margin trajectory as we head there? Obviously, the priority is on growth and there's lots of different areas to invest. But when we're setting expectations, how should we think about that given all of the opportunities that you have? 
David Ossip: So as I mentioned earlier, Dayforce Wallet, which obviously will come into the growth revenue number in 2021. 2020 is largely the investment year. I mentioned that we are investing about an additional $9 million versus last year in the Dayforce Wallet without really seeing the benefits from the Dayforce Wallet in 2020. That begins to reverse in 2021. So you should see the EBITDA margins improving once again as we go into future years. 
 We remain -- Mark, we remain quite consistent with the long-term guidance that we've given the market, as you pointed out, exceeding $1 billion of revenue in 2021. And as we mentioned throughout 2019, we would expect that the long-term EBITDA margins to exceed 30%, just a little bit lagged up with the $1 billion. 
Mark Marcon: Great. And then with regards to the time line on the end-of-life strategy for Bureau, can you just give us a little bit more color there? 
David Ossip: Well, if you look at the numbers backwards, again, you take the $102 million, $103 million for the year, you subtract out, say, $50 million for tax, another about $15 million or so for the small business product, and given that we're migrating somewhere around -- what is it Jeremy, about $5 million? 
Jeremy Johnson: A quarter. 
David Ossip: A quarter. At the end of the year, there's not that much Bureau left in to end-of-life. 
Mark Marcon: Got it. And then you mentioned a number of really impressive wins. Can you talk about who those wins came from? And is there any change in terms of the composition of who you're going up against as you look towards future opportunities? 
David Ossip: When we go into these larger deals, there is probably more of the legacy types of components that are used at those particular clients. So if I point to the consulting company, I believe that they were moving from a legacy payroll solution. The quick-service restaurant, I believe they had tried to implement another cloud solution that wasn't successful and that we are replacing, in their case, Jeremy, do you know who it was? 
Jeremy Johnson: I don't know. No, no. 
David Ossip: Yes. I think it's kind of a legacy solution that they had beforehand. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Drew Kootman with Cantor Fitzgerald. 
Drew Kootman: I was curious, just going back to the wallet. Longer term, if we look 3, 5 years, how big you think it could be with the kind of penetration? Just anything around that? 
David Ossip: Well, if we look at it from the total potential, as you know, we move around $300 billion of payroll funds a year, about half of that, say, $150 billion is paid out in net earnings to the employees. As we've discussed previously, we expect to make about 0.8% on all spend on the wallet. So at 100% penetration, you're looking at potentially about $1.2 billion of really top line and bottom line. And obviously, it will take a lot of time to increase the penetration, and we won't reach 100%. But for every 10% penetration, we guess, it's worth about $100 million of revenue. 
 As we get more days are based on the usage of the wallet once people start using it, we'll start to disclose that. 
Drew Kootman: Perfect. And then just looking at the professional services gross margin. I know that was positive and you guys talked about that. But I know you guys were looking for it to be flattish moving forward. But just curious what your thoughts are around that moving forward now? 
David Ossip: So on the professional services, obviously, you saw a tremendous jump in terms of professional services and other revenue. If we look at it year-over-year, Q4 of last year was $29.4 million. In Q4 of '19, it jumped to up by 51% to $44.4 million. That really is reflected in the amount of recurring revenue that we took live in Q4, which was a new record for us as well. 
 In terms of the profitability on that group, again, also tremendous progress over there. We went from the professional services and other gross margin of being effectively negative 10.6% last year to negative -- sorry, to positive 5.9% this year. So really up really, really nicely. On a go-forward basis, in terms of 2020, I would expect it to be around breakeven. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Berg with Needham. 
Scott Berg: Congrats on a strong sales quarter. David, I was just hoping that you could dig into your comments on the sales, the record value of new sales in the quarter a little bit. Was that driven by you selling to larger customers with more seats? Or do you think it's driven more by adoption of incremental modules now that you've released a lot -- several of them over the last 2 or 3 years? 
David Ossip: So it's a combination of both. If I look at the quick service restaurants, you already are looking at adoption of a lot of our features that we now have inside the platform. In the case of the consulting organization, it's largely a payroll deal that we sold over there. However, if you look at the number of employees, you can see that as the year progressed in 2019, we had bigger and bigger wins when it came to employee populations. 
 Last year, for example, we would have said a 50,000 employee amusement park would have been a record number. But when I look at the quick service restaurant, you're almost 3x that in terms of the employee headcount. So the answer is it's both. 
Scott Berg: Got it. Helpful. And then another several questions on wallets. But wanted to see if you can help us understand where the initial interest in the product is coming from. Do you have any commonalities across the customers that have shown an interest in it today, maybe your size or type of industry or something unique about those employees, anything there would all also be helpful? 
David Ossip: It's right across the gamut. We're seeing a relatively large organizations, the small organizations showing a lot of interest. And we're also seeing a uptick across the hourly salary, part-time market as well. I have spoken about this beforehand but in all the studies I've seen publicly in the studies that we've done internally shows that there is -- about 80% of all people really have struggled to bridge their finances, paycheck-to-paycheck and it doesn't really come from being a salaried individual hourly or part timer, it's generally a common pain point across all employees. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. 
Raimo Lenschow: A question on the -- you had a couple of very large wins in the international markets like the U.K., like the big coffee chain, et cetera. How are the implementations going there and the go-lives going there? And what does it mean for kind of the next customers? Because I'm sure a lot of people will look for what's going on there. And then the one question I got from a lot of people on the call was around, like, lower number of customer adds in Q4. In a way, can I see that -- can I say what you just answered that you have like big and bigger customers, basically also that there will be slower customer additions than in the past? 
David Ossip: Great. So in terms of Costa Coffee, which obviously, we've discussed previously, the implementation is going very well. I would expect them to go live in the first half of this year. So just in a few months, they should be live. I think they're very happy with the progress of the implementation. 
 In terms of the move upmarket, yes, if I look at the customer account, we added, Jeremy, 194 customers in Q4 of this year as compared to 253. However, if you look at the number of active users we have on the system now, we're up 800,000 users in 2019 versus the 600,000 employees that we took live in 2018. So we've increased the add-on employees by 20 -- actually, it's more than that. It's 33% year-over-year on a smaller number of customers taken live, right, 645 versus 717. And that's obviously reflected both in the incremental revenue per Dayforce customer, again, that is up 34% to $209,000. It's also reflected in the trailing 12-month Dayforce revenue per customer, which is up by 12% overall. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. 
Matthew Coss: This is Matt Coss on behalf of Mark Murphy. As you build out native payroll for Germany and Mexico and Mauritius, do you expect this to require a similar length of time and dollar investment compared to prior native payroll build-outs? Or is there some savings or learnings that you can leverage as you build out for these countries? 
David Ossip: So that's actually a great question. So if I look at the -- our EBITDA guidance, for 2020, which, as I said, it's an investment year, there is an additional about $12 million of investment in global as compared to 2019. And that is really reflected not only in the incremental spend in R&D to build out those countries, but also in the sales and operation expenditures to establish in those 2 new countries plus Mauritius, plus as well continuing to grow and invest in the -- our 4 other countries outside of the U.S. and Canada that we're very active in. 
Matthew Coss: Okay. That's helpful. And on the professional services side, again, kudos on the growth in the pro services gross margins. Is there sort of a ceiling that we can expect or a steady state for pro services gross margin going forward, roughly? 
David Ossip: I would model it on a breakeven basis going forward. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau with William Blair. 
Matthew Pfau: Just wanted to ask on the Australia business and how the RITEQ acquisition is progressing? Is your thesis with that business playing out? And then what are your thoughts on continuing to use that acquisition strategy to gain a foothold in additional countries? 
David Ossip: We're pleased with the progress of the RITEQ acquisition. Remember, the RITEQ acquisition had a large component of acquiring very talented people who were expert on workforce management. And we required that expertise to really continue growing our Australia and New Zealand business, with the Dayforce footprint. In -- going forward, the typical global acquisition that we would look for typically would have a payroll component, not only a workforce management component. So it's somewhat different to the RITEQ acquisition. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. 
Brad Zelnick: Congrats on all the success. David, just on international. Kronos recently mentioned about 35% international growth. They seem to be the only other HCM pure-play competitor of size that's pursuing the international strategy. Can you help us understand how their footprint and offering may differ from yours in international? And why your acquisition-led strategy is differentiated and who you're displacing? 
David Ossip: Sure. Remember, Kronos, on a global basis really is workforce management. So time and attendance and scheduling. Of which, we've had as well for quite some time. We're active with Dayforce Workforce Management in dozens of countries globally. I do not believe that Kronos has any native payroll capabilities on a global basis, whereas we -- our Dayforce engine at the moment is active in 6 countries at the moment. And when we look at our partnership through the connected pay, we have 7 global partners that gives us coverage in another 157 countries, which accounts for majority of the working population of the world. So I think we're quite differentiated. 
 In terms of an acquisition strategy, our acquisition strategy effectively would be to acquire companies that have a global presence but have legacy technology and over time, migrate their customers and their salespeople on to the native Dayforce system, which is that all single solution that cuts right across human capital management, including payroll and tax capabilities. 
Brad Zelnick: Yes. In fact, we noticed how quickly you got RITEQ up and running. Are all 325 of their pre-existing customers now migrated over to the integrated new platform that you've localized? 
David Ossip: No, it will take some time to do that. And remember, with the RITEQ customers, their customers are workforce management only. So there's an upsell capability to move them onto the Dayforce platform. But we also are leveraging the RITEQ people, not only for implementation capacity in Australia and New Zealand, but also the R&D resources have been integrated into the Dayforce R&D team. 
Brad Zelnick: And if I could just sneak in one quick follow-up here. If I look at the 2020 adjusted EBITDA guide, ex float revenue of 10% to 15%. It's a fairly wide range, ranging anywhere from again, ex float margin compression to margin expansion. And I appreciate the investment priorities and your comments that this is an investment year. But can you give us a sense of, again, considering the range what would be the greatest factors that would swing it one way versus the other? And perhaps a good time to just even remind us of the investment philosophy that you have and the time line that you consider when looking to see a payback? 
David Ossip: Sure. So in the EBITDA guidance, there's probably an additional $25 million that we're investing this year above what we regularly would invest in the business. And if I were to break it out, which I've done on the call today is almost about $9 million of additional expense in the Dayforce Wallet. If I look at the government vertical, there's a little bit over an additional $1 million of R&D effort and investment that we've put into that. 
 On the global side, as I mentioned, it's above $12 million of additional spend, which is spread between operations, R&D, sales and marketing given that we have 6 active countries or 4 countries outside of U.S. and Canada. We're building another 3 this year as well. And then there is another about $3 million outside that we're also investing in the enterprise side of the business, which is building out certain enterprise-specific features for the industries that we're currently playing, building out the sales and marketing team to go a bit wider and deeper in those particular verticals. 
 The strategy for this year again, it's an investment year. We -- the intent is to hold EBITDA effectively flat outside of the headwinds that we have in float. We might see, as you mentioned, a slight increase in margins of about 10 to 15 basis points. And then as we go beyond 2021, we'll continue with our trajectory to above 30% long-term EBITDA margin. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Merwin with Goldman Sachs. 
Christopher Merwin: So just a couple of questions. I guess, we come back to services for a bit. It was obviously, kind of the really healthy growth that you've seen there. I know you called out 606 as a driver. But as you bring on larger customers, is it fair to say they're paying significantly more for services? And as you continue to bring on those large customers in 2020, should we see pretty strong growth for that segment continuing in the year? 
David Ossip: So when we look at services, remember, inside, there are a number of lines. You have professional services, which is services to customers that are already live. You also have activations, which effectively are taking customers live. And then you have clocks, which is a clock hardware that we sell. If we look at the breakdown of Q4 of '19, you'll see that professional services went down in the quarter from 27% to 23%, and we had kind of an increase on activations from 53% to 59% with inside the quarter. And clocks was effectively the same. It went from 20% to 18%. As we go forward, I would expect to continue to see growth on the professional services to customers that are already live continue as that's, obviously, more customers are live, more using the products. So there's an opportunity and the need to sell services to those customers. We'll continue to see increases in activations as we go forward. 
 So from a dollar basis, you'll continue to see an increase in that. And from a clock basis, that really comes down to the mix of business, and I would expect it to continue a kind of around that 20% range in future Q4 of the year. 
Christopher Merwin: Great. And then just one more on sales efficiency. As you continue to go after these large logos, are you seeing the same efficiency in that segment as you have with mid-market and as enterprise grows as a percentage of the mix, could that actually be a tailwind to sales efficiency in time? 
David Ossip: Well, on the sales efficiency, sales and marketing is about 20%. In Q4, it's up about 160 basis points relative to Q4 of '18. That largely was because we had a record sales quarter, and it reflects the commissions that we paid out for those particular deals. I expect that we'll continue to be efficient on our sales and marketing going forward. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Thank you.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-11-07 17:00:00) =====

 The third quarter earnings release and quarterly report on Form 10-Q, the related financial statements and the MD&A have been furnished or filed with the SEC and will be available on the SEC's EDGAR database in the U.S. and the SEDAR database in Canada as well as on the Ceridian Investor Relations website at investors.ceridian.com. As a reminder, all figures discussed on this conference call are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted. 
 And with that, I will turn the call over to David. 
David Ossip: Thanks, Jeremy. Good evening, everyone. And thank you for joining our earnings call. We are very pleased with the results from the third quarter of 2019. Dayforce momentum remains strong, with Dayforce recurring revenue growing by 33% both on a GAAP basis and on a constant currency basis. Total Dayforce revenue, including professional services and other, increased by 30% year-over-year on a GAAP basis and 31% on a constant currency basis. As we had expected, the revenue growth for both Dayforce recurring and Dayforce total revenue reaccelerated. Dayforce total revenue growth exceeded 30% for the first time since the third quarter of 2018. Including Powerpay, Cloud revenue grew by 26%, both on a GAAP basis and on a constant currency basis. 
 Moving on to customer accounts. We ended the quarter with 4,169 customers live on the Dayforce platform, a net increase of 163 customers from the second quarter of 2019 and a net increase of 704 customers since September 30, 2018. 
 From a profitability standpoint, we were pleased that Cloud recurring services gross margin expanded 440 basis points year-over-year to 70.2% and professional services and other gross margin improved from negative 13.6% to negative 7.7%. 
 Adjusted EBITDA was $46.4 million, an increase of 27.5% compared to last year, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 22.9%, an increase of 250 basis points compared to last year. 
 Moving on to our focused areas of investment, product development and sales and marketing. Our cash investment in product development, including research and development expense and capitalized software development, was $17.4 million or 8.6% of revenue, an increase of 21% compared to the third quarter of 2018. Sales and marketing expenses during the third quarter were $35.5 million or 17.5% of revenue, up by approximately $7 million, an increase of 26%. This represents a continuation of our investments to grow in the enterprise segments and to grow in global territories. 
 Also during the quarter, we announced our acquisition of RITEQ, an Australian provider of enterprise workforce management solutions. We followed the acquisition with a series of summits in Melbourne and Sydney and are positioning the full Dayforce suite to the 325 RITEQ customers. We have seen significant success thus far, and remain excited about our potential in this region. The acquisition provides Dayforce with an immediate presence in the ANZ region, a solid customer base to move to Dayforce and a wealth of localized knowledge to enhance the breadth of the native Dayforce offering. We believe this type of acquisition strategy can be replicated across the globe and can be used to accelerate our global expansion, which we believe can reach 20 countries within the next 3 years. 
 Moving on to the sales in the third quarter. We continue to see strong demand, and I want to spend a few minutes highlighting some of the key wins, beginning with the traction in North America this quarter. First, we won a large health care account that provides home and community-based services. The customer purchased the full Dayforce suite to manage over 35,000 employees. Dayforce will help them streamline the employee onboarding experience and empower managers with access to real-time data and workforce management capabilities. Each winning account was our track record of consistently delivering new features to market and our experience processing large complex payrolls. Decision-makers from the company attended our 2018 Insights Conference and an HCM summit. 
 We also won at a large retail and wholesale footwear company with more than 30 brands, 13,000 employees and approximately 12,000 locations across North America. The company was struggling with an in-house pay and benefits model and an aging workforce management system. They chose Dayforce for core HR, managed payroll benefits and wage administration as well as advanced workforce management. And we had a large retail won with an online women's clothing retail business based in San Francisco. The company had recently acquired a major luxury retailer with over 8,000 employees. They selected Dayforce for payroll, HR benefits and time and attendance. This win was a great example of the scale we're seeing in the private equity channel and the impact it is having on our growth in the market. 
 We have a few significant ones in Australia and the U.K., which further highlight the momentum we're seeing globally. In Australia, we signed a leading retailer, our performance and lifestyle footwear with more than 9,000 employees and 500 stores across Australia and New Zealand. The company was using multiple third-party solutions to handle payroll time and workforce management. The team wanted to replace these different systems with a single end-to-end HCM platform. They chose Dayforce for engaging user experience, strong workforce management functionality and best-in-class talent management. 
 In the U.K., we want to deal with the largest operator of fitness facilities in the region. The company chose Dayforce to help manage its 3,500 employees while trying to double the size of their business. The organization needed to modernize its systems and get access to data that would help them allocate the right people at the right time to improve control over labor spend. 
 I also would like to provide an update on the Canadian government opportunity. As background, in June, we signed a contract with the government of Candor, enabling us to build for the government's future payroll time and HCM business against 2 other vendors. 
 In September, the government issued a press release detailing the fact that they have secured CAD 117 million to co-design and deliver pilot projects for next-generation human resources and pay solution. These pilot projects will test potential solutions against the real complexities of the federal government's human resources and pay systems. We continue to believe that we are uniquely qualified and well positioned to replace the government's existing system and to deliver on-time and after payroll due to more than 300,000 federal employees in Canada. We are currently working for government to secure a formal contract for the pilot project, and we believe we will begin work on the pilot project in 2020. 
 I would like to spend a few minutes recapping our successful customer conference INSIGHTS held in Las Vegas the week of October 21. The event was great, with over 2,900 attendees and over 60 customer presentations and over 150 sessions. We spoke about the importance of intelligent HCM and announced 3 new products, including Dayforce Intelligence, which combines data with predictive technologies to identify and measure key metrics for each HCM process: Dayforce Hub, which allows customers to tailor the Dayforce experience with their branding and content through configurable wages and style; and the Dayforce Wallet, which leverages our continuous calculation differentiation and processes the same-day payroll each time a worker request their pay, and allowing employees to access their earned wages before their normal payroll debt. 
 We also announced the launch of enhancements in our Powerpay product. The enhancements give customers the ability to manage their employees, secure company's sensitive documentation, modernize the onboarding process and manage time-off efficiently. We believe these enhancements, along with the existing strength of the Powerpay products and customer base, will enable us to continue growth in the Powerpay revenue into the future. 
 On the people side, we welcome Bill Crawford to the Ceridian team as our Chief Value Officer, reporting to Leagh Turner. Bill's experience in the global HCM space, where he has led high-performing sales functions, will provide Ceridian with significant leadership depth as we continue to execute on our ambitions in the enterprise and global markets. 
 And finally, we announced this evening via Form 8-K, the planned retirement of our CFO, Arthur Gitajn, at the end of December 2020 and the launch of a search for his replacement. Arthur will continue as CFO until we have onboarded a new CFO, who will be fully employed by Ceridian until December 31, 2020. And  then we'll continue to support the company as a consultant until the end of June 2022. 
 I will now turn it over to Arthur to discuss our financial results and guidance with you in greater detail. 
Arthur Gitajn: Thank you, David, and good evening, everyone. I'm going to take a few minutes to talk about our third quarter 2019 financial results, and then I'll provide guidance for the full fiscal year 2019. 
 Starting with our third quarter 2019 financial results. Revenue from our flagship Cloud HCM platform Dayforce increased by $33.3 million or 30.2% to $143.7 million. On a constant currency basis, Dayforce revenue increased 30.5%. 
 Revenue from Powerpay, our Cloud HR and payroll solution for the Canadian small business market, increased by 2.3% to $21.8 million. On a constant currency basis, Powerpay revenue increased 3.7%. Cloud revenue, which includes both Dayforce and Powerpay, increased by $33.8 million or 25.7% to $165.5 million. On a constant currency basis, Cloud revenue increased 26.2%. And total revenue, which includes revenue from both our Cloud and Bureau solutions, increased by $24.2 million or 13.6% to $202.3 million. And on a constant currency basis, total revenue increased 14%. 
 Our guidance for 2019 assumed U.S. dollar to Canadian dollar exchange rate of $1.30. The Canadian dollar weakened against the U.S. dollar during the third quarter and the average exchange rate for the quarter was $1.32. Even with the weaker Canadian dollar, which had the effect of reducing Cloud revenue by $900,000, Cloud revenue exceeded the high end of our $162 million to $164 million guidance range by $1.5 million and by $2.4 million on a constant currency basis. Total revenue exceeded the high end of our $195 million to $197 million guidance range by $5.3 million and by $6.4 million on a constant currency basis. And adjusted EBITDA exceeded the high end of our $41 million to $43 million guidance range by $3.4 million, primarily due to solid revenue results. 
 Cloud revenue growth in the third quarter was driven by a 26.6% increase in Cloud recurring services revenue and a 22.3% increase in Cloud professional services and other revenue. Of the $33.8 million increase in total Cloud revenue, $5 million or 15% was attributable to Bureau customers migrating to Dayforce. Excluding the impact of migrations to Dayforce, revenue from Bureau solutions declined by $4.6 million or 9.9%, which was in line with our expectations. Cloud revenue accounted for 82% of our total revenue in the third quarter of 2019 compared to 74% in the third quarter of 2018. 
 The average float balance for our customer trust funds during the third quarter was approximately $3.12 billion compared to $2.97 billion in the third quarter last year. The average yield on our float balance was 2.33% during the third quarter of 2019, an increase of 22 basis points compared to the average yield in the third quarter of 2018. As a result, income from invested customer trust funds was $18.3 million in the third quarter compared to $15.8 million in the third quarter last year. The balance sheet value of customer trust funds as of September 30, 2019, was $2.6 billion, which was relatively unchanged from the balance at December 31, 2018. 
 We continued to expand our gross margins during the third quarter. While Cloud recurring services revenue grew $27.5 million or 26.6%, our cost of Cloud recurring services to support this growth increased by only $3.6 million or 10.2%, and our gross margin on Cloud recurring services increased from 65.8% in the third quarter last year to 70.2%, reflecting an increase in the proportion of Dayforce customers live for more than 2 years from 62% in the third quarter last year to 68%, and also our ability to continue to realize economies of scale in customer support and hosting costs. 
 Our negative gross margin on professional services and other revenue improved from negative 13.6% in the third quarter last year to negative 7.7% due to productivity improvements in implementing new customers, reflecting the increased experience of our implementation consultants and also the continued use of automation in our implementation processes. Activations increased to $22.7 million or 66% of Cloud professional services and other costs in the third quarter compared to $18.1 million or 64% of Cloud professional services and other costs in the third quarter last year. And post go-live professional services increased to $8.1 million or 23% of Cloud professional services and other costs in the third quarter compared to $6.1 million or 22% of Cloud professional services and other costs in the third quarter last year. 
 We continue to invest in research and development and in sales and marketing to support long-term growth in Dayforce, and product development and management expenses increased by $3 million or 20.7% to $17.5 million. Sales and marketing expenses increased $7.3 million or 25.9% to $35.5 million, and sales and marketing expenses as a percent of revenue increased from 15.8% to 17.5%. 
 G&A expenses increased $17.7 million to $46.8 million. As disclosed in our 10-Q filed earlier today, most of this increase in G&A is attributable to an isolated service incident on September 26, 2019. Through October 31, $12.6 million remains unrecovered, and we've recorded a loss for this amount within G&A. The incident did not create financial exposure for any of our customers as customers only funded the correct payroll amounts. We've identified the issue and corrected the underlying problem to prevent a reoccurrence. Although the fiscal impact of this isolated incident has been excluded from adjusted EBITDA, it had an adverse impact on operating profit, which was $6.5 million compared to $16.2 million in the third quarter last year. Excluding the impact of this isolated service incident, our operating profit would have been $19.1 million, up 17.9% year-over-year. Collection efforts are ongoing, and we expect to have further recoveries, which will be recognized as a reduction to G&A expense in future periods. We'll exclude any subsequent recoveries from adjusted EBITDA and detail any material positive impacts of additional recoveries on operating profit when we report Q4 results. 
 Adjusted EBITDA increased by $10 million or 27.5% to $46.4 million and adjusted EBITDA margin increased approximately 250 basis points from 20.4% to 22.9%. 
 During the quarter, we determined that given consistent profitability since our IPO and our forecast for the future, we believe it's more likely than not that we will be able to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets, and therefore, we've released  $65.8 million of our valuation allowance. This $65.8 million tax benefit was partially offset by $200,000 in aggregate tax expense, and we recorded a net tax benefit of $65.6 million during the third quarter. Including the effect of this tax benefit, diluted net income per share was $0.42 in the third quarter of this year compared to $0.03 in the third quarter last year. Adjusted diluted net income per share was $0.11 in the third quarter this year compared to diluted net income per share of $0.10 in the third quarter last year. 
 Moving to the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $270.9 million, an increase of $53.1 million compared to December 31, 2018, and our total debt was $666.1 million as of September 30, 2019, a reduction of $4.2 million compared to December 31, 2018. Our capital expenditures in Q3 2019 were $12 million compared to $9.9 million in Q3 2018. Included in the $12 million in capital expenditures were $3.1 million for property and equipment and $8.9 million for software and technology, of which $8.7 million was capitalized software development. 
 Turning now to our outlook for the full year fiscal 2019. Given our performance in the first 3 quarters, we are raising our full year fiscal 2019 revenue guidance. Specifically, on a constant currency basis, we expect Cloud revenue to be in the range of $659 million to $662 million, an increase of 24.7% to 25.3% on a constant currency basis. Assuming Powerpay revenue of approximately $92.5 million, Dayforce revenue is expected to be in the range of $566.5 million to $569.5 million. And total revenue is expected to be in the range of $822 million to $825 million, an increase of 11.1% to 11.5% on a constant currency basis.
 Our full year revenue guidance incorporates the 25 basis point reduction in the federal discount rate at the end of October. Each 100 basis point change in interest rates is estimated to have approximately an $18 million impact on float revenue over the ensuing 12 months. We're continuing to invest in the digital wallet, global expansion and sales growth, and we are reaffirming the full year adjusted EBITDA range we provided on February 6, 2019. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $182 million to $187 million or an increase of 13.3% to 16.4% year-over-year. 
 At this time, I'm going to hand the call back to the operator, and I'm going to open the line for questions. Thank you. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies. 
Samad Samana: Great. So I guess, first, David, if I could. On the Canada contract, I know on the heels of that, the company announced a new public sector team. I was wondering if you could give us an update on how that vertical is doing and maybe if you're drawing more interest from the public sector, given that you're involved in this Canada contract. 
David Ossip: So thanks, Samad. As you know, we are quite excited about helping the Canadian government in payments people correctly. We did bring in a very experienced subject matter expert, and we did launch the new public sector vertical probably about a quarter ago. We are seeing traction already in increased demand and pipeline build, but it's too early to really talk about the impact of that particular vertical. We'll report on it obviously more in subsequent quarters. 
Samad Samana: Great. And then maybe if I could just ask a follow-up question. In terms of the acceleration, it seems like the company is executing on that. I know it's too early to start thinking about 2020, but you announced a number of large logos this quarter that you won, and we're seeing larger and larger customers go live. How should we think about that acceleration in 4Q and then into 2020? 
David Ossip: Well, as you know, we don't provide guidance for 2020, but I can't speak about Q4, and I did mention that as well in my little talk over there. We obviously expect Dayforce revenue to continue to accelerate in Q4. And what I did point out is that we believe that the total Dayforce revenue acceleration will be driven by Dayforce recurring. Again, we typically go into a quarter with a very high degree of confidence, given that the recurring revenue is really determined by the go-live at the end of Q3 and the professional services, obviously, the contracts we're working on, mostly to get live at the end of Q4. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird. 
Mark Marcon: I was wondering, could you talk a little bit about the composition of some of the wins that came this quarter? You mentioned roughly 167 that you ended up implementing. Are they typically coming from some of the older legacy players? Or how's that mix changing? And then specifically, with some of the really big wins, the first big win that you mentioned in terms of 35,000 employees, or what was the old client there? 
David Ossip: Sure. So first of all, the number was 163, not 167, and that is the accounts that we activated in the quarter, not the accounts that we sold in the quarter. The composition of those accounts would be quite typical for what we usually would expect across different verticals. In terms of the competitors or the systems that we're replacing, it hasn't changed. About half the time, it would be a direct competitor. And the other half of the time, it will be more legacy systems, whether they'd be homegrown or more antiquated types of technology that may not be in service. 
 In the case of the large health care company, it was a combination of a large workforce management vendor that we replaced on the time and attendance side. And I believe, but I'm not certain, is that they had an ERP system, I think, on the payroll side. We also obviously did the full talent suite for them, too. 
Mark Marcon: Great. And then at your conference, you talked more about the Wallet and on-demand pay capabilities. Wondering if you can talk a little bit about what the feedback was to you from some of the bigger clients in terms of their interest there. 
David Ossip: So we obviously are very excited about the Dayforce Wallet and the launch of the Dayforce card, which will be, obviously, inside the Wallet in Q1 of next year. The reaction from the client base has been very high. We have started to take orders for activation of the Wallet in Q1, and I expect it will grow very quickly next year. 
Mark Marcon: Really, that's great. And then can you talk just a little bit about the isolated incident? It's detailed in the queue, but just what was the underlying nature? And do you expect to recoup the funds? 
David Ossip: So Arthur, don't... 
Arthur Gitajn: Yes. So we had an isolated incident on Thursday, September 26. It resulted in duplicate payments for a portion of our U.S. payroll customers. We identified the issue. We corrected the underlying problem. The incident didn't create any financial exposure for any of our customers. With respect to the charge, rather than speculate about how much more we may recover, we booked a loss for the -- in the full amount of the remaining $12.6 million, but we do expect additional recoveries in Q4. And again, we'll adjust those from adjusted EBITDA. And to the extent they're material, we'll identify them and their impact on operating results. 
Mark Marcon: And it was a single incident. 
Arthur Gitajn: Isolated incidents and fully remediated. 
Mark Marcon: And fully remediate. Great. And Arthur, I just want to say congrats and commend you for everything as well as the way that you announced this with such a nice lead time. So that's fantastic. 
Arthur Gitajn: Thank you. 
Operator: And your next question comes from Daniel Jester with Citi. 
Daniel Jester: So just on the international expansion, you talked about this, the aspiration to get to 20 countries over the next couple of years. Can you talk about some of the characteristics of the market that you would be looking at? I mean, obviously, you're in some today. But how should we think about layering that in over the next couple of years? 
David Ossip: Sure. So again, just as a reminder, when I look at the market in about 2010, 2011, we kind of identified that half of our addressable market was outside of the U.S. and Canada. And so we designed the platform from the very beginning to be global in nature, and that obviously deals with everything from culture to language localization. We have over 20 languages already supported, currency, FX, state formatting. We also built the rule engine in a way that we could extend it very easily into new jurisdictions. And when we first launched Dayforce in 2013, we launched it at the same time for both the U.S. and Canada, both of which are very difficult jurisdictions. Since then, we've now expanded the product into 4 additional jurisdictions. And the cost of us extending to each of these jurisdictions is probably about $1 million to $2 million of direct work for that particular jurisdiction. 
 We've also already built out global workforce management. So that's dealing with all the various types of time rules, contract structures that you have on a global basis. From a data privacy and protection perspective, we've built full -- what they call GDPR compliance into the product, which allows us to adhere to the various GDPR policies by different countries across Europe and the U.K. 
 Our plans for expansion most likely will involve some M&A, very similar to what Dayforce did with Ceridian back in 2012, 2013. We were able to partner, in that case, with Ceridian as an organization who had very deep domain knowledge, a very good distribution, but given at the time have the most modern and competitive technology. We believe that there are many such opportunities out there on a global basis where we can find companies, extend the Dayforce platform into that particular jurisdiction, using their people who have the domain knowledge and then obviously, leveraging their distribution capability to accelerate our penetration into that particular market. 
Daniel Jester: Great. That's really helpful context. And then on the announcements that you made, the enhancements for -- in Canada for the Powerpay application. I think you've said in the past that you were hoping to -- or at least aspiring to reaccelerate growth in that particular business up towards maybe the high single digits over time. Are these enhancements enough to get you there? Or should we be expecting more in the future there? 
David Ossip: It's a start of the enhancements. So this gives us some basic HR and talent capability for the Powerpay customers. As you know, we have close to 50,000 different organizations that use the Powerpay product. We pay about a million people on that particular platform. This allows us immediately to go back to the Powerpay base and offer them a new functionality at a higher monthly fee. And as we build out more talent capabilities, we'll give us more ability to go back to that base in the future as well. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. 
Matthew Coss: Coss on behalf of Mark Murphy. David, we spoke with some of your services partners at INSIGHTS, who said that, in bake-offs were only Oracle, SAP and Workday once competed. Ceridian has started to be part of that mix. What is it about some of these larger customers? Or what do they see in Ceridian that makes it very attractive and maybe more so than what it used to now that you're being involved in some of those bake-offs? 
David Ossip: So a few things on this. Very similar to global, when we designed the Dayforce platform, we built it in a way that we could scale to very large workforces. So highly scalable raw engine, very efficient data structures the differentiation that we see in what we call the enterprise segment, this would be with accounts that are greater than 10,000 employees, is the continuous calculation engine where every time a time sheet, HR record changes, we are able to recalculate the net earnings. The larger the customer, the more valuable that is because it gives them much more time to verify that the payroll data is correct. 
 As you remember, instead of waiting until the end of the pay cycle, we allow the payroll staff access to the data at the very beginning. They can run their audits, do their edits and their adjustments immediately. And that means at the end of the pay cycle, they effectively are done. We also allow organizations to enable a payroll preview for employees to view their pay slips during the active pay cycle. And much like allowing the payroll staffed early access to the data, allowing employees to verify their own data before the money is transferred, gives them much more time -- the organization, much more time to verify and to pay people accurately. The benefits of the continuous calculation engine obviously apply as well to generating useful business information for all people inside the organization, and we obviously are leveraging that now inside the Dayforce Wallet, which, again, allows employees to view what they've earned at the end of each day and the ability to access that money without any direct fees. 
Matthew Coss: Helpful. And then maybe one for Arthur. Can you share your latest thoughts about the steady state of revenue from the Bureau business? I mean that's been declining roughly in the high teens and low 20s on a consistent basis. Any change to that decline? 
Arthur Gitajn: No. No. Again, the decline, excluding migrations, it was about 9.9%, which was as expected. I think if you go back, it's been in the 10% to 12% range. And likewise, the contribution of Bureau to Cloud, we would expect it to be in the 13% to 17% range, and that was also in line. 
Matthew Coss: Okay. But no drastic changes expected in that and how it's been contributing... 
Arthur Gitajn: No, but it's becoming less -- obviously, less and less of an issue. It's clean. Cloud is now 82% of our total revenue. 36 months ago, we just crossed the 50% line, and it's really less and less of an impact on the business. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Nandan Amladi with Guggenheim Partners. 
Nandan Amladi: So first one, perhaps for Arthur, the professional services gross margin has been improving steadily. But now that you're engaging a community of system integration partners to do the implementation, what will that trajectory look like over the next, say, 12 to 18 months? 
Arthur Gitajn: Well, again, we're not forecasting 2020 right now. But I mean part of the effort to engage third parties is to have a more profitable professional services and implementation function. 
Nandan Amladi: Right. Okay. And a follow-up for David. The reference to expanding to 20 countries in 3 years, and you touched on perhaps making some acquisitions to get there. Any indication of the balance of organic development versus acquisitions? 
David Ossip: I think you'll see a combination. Remember, even when we do an acquisition, we're not acquiring for technology. So the playbook over there is very similar to what we did with Ceridian. We would do a stop sell almost immediately. We would stop any new development on their products, put it into more of a maintenance mode. Over a 3- to 5-year period, we would look at migrating the customer base onto Dayforce. And we would use their knowledge, their people to help build out the user stories and have the Dayforce developers, obviously, build out the rule engine to handle those user stories very quickly and then to enter the market with proper momentum using -- leveraging the distribution network and such. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt Pfau with William Blair. 
Matthew Pfau: I wanted to ask on the U.K. and Australia markets. And now that you've been in them for several quarters, just wondering, how would you characterize the competitiveness of those markets for payroll relative to the U.S.? And then what are you seeing in terms of win rates in those markets versus the U.S.? 
David Ossip: Sure. So I'll -- first, by starting that, even in the U.S. and Canada, we already only see 2 competitors on a consistent basis. As we go global, whether it be the U.K. or Australia, it's a similar type of pattern. That there aren't that many people that actually play in the segments that we do. When I compare the U.K. to North America, I would argue that the vendors in the U.K. market are probably 10 years behind the North American players. And when I look at the Australian players, it seems that the technologies are probably another 5 to 10 years behind the U.K. So the advantages of the Dayforce platform, whether it be the full end-to-end human capital management functionality, that obviously allows us to differentiate in, what we call, the major markets up to that 6,000 employee space, having 1 database, 1 rule engine across all of the use cases around a particular worker, resonates exceptionally well in the U.K. and in Australia. And for the larger customers having that continuous calculation, this also gives them much more time to verify and validate the people getting paid correctly. 
Matthew Pfau: Got it. And is there any sort of investments or I guess time that it takes to maybe gain some brand awareness in those markets since you're -- with the Ceridian brand name, you're probably better known in North America than in some of these newer markets? 
David Ossip: That's a very good question, and that's where the M&A strategy comes in. In the last quarter, we did an acquisition of a workforce management company called RITEQ in Australia that has a presence in Australia, a little bit in New Zealand as well. And with that, we acquired several hundred customers. Immediately following the close of the acquisition, we did 2 HCM summits, one in Sydney and one in Melbourne, primarily targeting the RITEQ customer base. And we see that as a very good way of getting recognized very quickly in a particular market as a top player. 
Operator: And your next question comes from Scott Berg with Needham 
Scott Berg: Congrats on a good quarter. I guess, David, starting with you. If you take a step back, some of the commentary that we heard at HR Tech would indicate overall demand trends in the space look really strong, not just in the 2020, but for another kind of multiyear run, and this is after what most people would consider to be a 5- to 8-year run, a really good sales run in the space. How do you think long term your ability is from a competitive standpoint to even further penetrate different aspects of the maybe segments that you don't play in as strongly today? 
David Ossip: If I look at our market penetration in the U.S., I would think that we probably have less than a 5% market share today. I think our technology has -- most, I think, of the investors and the banks have verified is quite differentiated, both in the end-to-end feature set as well as the continuous calculation. I would argue that we probably are 5 to 10 years ahead of the 2 other competitors in this space, and we've now proven out that we have a very robust and scalable solution with over 4,000 customers live on the actual product. The number of customers that we're taking live has obviously accelerated slightly in the size of the customers, as you can see, with some of the health care and retail wins that we discussed have obviously gone up. 
 So I think that you'll see us grow, first of all, in capturing more of, what I'll call, a compliance application market, which would be payroll, time and benefits. We were very strong. On the talent side, we are really fortifying our offerings around recruiting, performance management, compensation management, learning management. And our market share of various particular markets is obviously less than we see on the compliance side. So I still think there's tremendous long-term growth in that. There also is potential growth in adjacent markets where we don't play in at all, and you'll see some build or some M&A activity in those markets, probably over the next 12 to 24 months. And then on the global side, we've just really begun. And the traction we're having in the U.K. and in Australia is very positive, and I expect it to continue to be very good into the future. And we're also very excited with the potential for the Dayforce Wallet and what we can do around financial wellness. 
Scott Berg: Quite helpful there. And then from a follow-up perspective, Arthur, how should we think about Dayforce gross margins kind of trending or tracking from an intermediate term perspective, multiyear trend? You've had obviously a nice jump year-over-year, but Dayforce revenues already make up a substantial portion of total revenues? Just trying to understand maybe what that trajectory can actually look like from the current high level. 
Arthur Gitajn: Well, our gross margin on Cloud recurring services is -- really on the cost side, is hosting and customer support. And we continue to get economies of scale in hosting. And on customer support, in addition to economies of scale, we also have the phenomenon of customers live for more than 2 years. The actual number of customers live for more than 2 years increased by more than 30% year-over-year. And we know from experience that customers live for more than 2 years, we have fewer customer support tickets. So we would expect gross margins on Cloud recurring services to continue to expand. And likewise, on professional services, we would expect the trend toward breakeven to continue as well. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. 
Sitikantha Panigrahi: Right. Just a follow-up -- just following up on that international expansion. It makes sense for you to go aggressive and expand on your native payroll in 20 different countries, given your technology advantage over competitors. And also good to see some of the notable wins in the U.K. and Australia, and now RITEQ under your umbrella. Just wondering if you could talk about, right now, international revenue. How much is that in -- as a percentage of revenue? And how do you expect that to grow in the next few years? 
David Ossip: Sure. We don't report on international revenue as a percentage of overall revenue. But what I have said and we believe it to be true is that in 2019, most of the growth would come from our further penetration in major markets. In 2020, you'll see the impact in the -- our success in the enterprise market, and we believe that you'll see an impact from the global expansion in 2021 and beyond. 
Sitikantha Panigrahi: Okay. That's helpful. And now on the on-demand pay side, and that's definitely an emerging team right now in payroll industry. But you guys seem to have a very differentiating offering than some of your competitors who offer loans or charge employee or employer transaction. So could you tell how big is that on demand opportunity for you? And also, what sort of feedback you got from customer with that digital wallet announcement. And how are you planning to monetize that? 
David Ossip: Sure. So the way that we differentiate with the Dayforce Wallet and the Dayforce card is that each time an employee loads the Dayforce card, we do a same-day payroll for that employee, which means we did the submissions of all the necessary remittances immediately. And so we have a fully compliant solution. From a go-to-market perspective, we've been able to take it out in a way that we don't have to charge the customer an additional PEPM to offer it to their employees, and we don't change the way that they do their funding. They still fund at the end of the actual payroll cycle. And from an employee perspective, in the U.S., we don't have any direct fees for the employee either. So we believe with that, we should see very quick adoption of the product. 
 In terms of penetration, as I mentioned earlier, we've seen a high demand from customers who have seen it. I think the customers appreciate that we took the necessary time to do the proper research and proper consumer testing so that we can launch the product in a way that makes tremendous sense to both the employers and the workers at those particular companies. And I believe that it will be a very successful launch come Q1. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. 
Raimo Lenschow: David, can I stay on that subject? Do you know, like if you think about it, a few years back, when we move to kind of direct deposit from check, and I was like, oh my god, everyone was kind of pushing against that. Now you kind of -- if you think what you do with same-day payroll, it almost feels like the technology has just moved on, that it's now possible and it should be a next evolution of the industry. Would you kind of agree with that? Or is this kind of a different kind of step? 
David Ossip: Look, Raimo, I think it makes tremendous sense. We know that almost 80% of all people out there live paycheck to paycheck. We also know that when we do surveying of people, especially the younger generations, over 50% of them want to get paid much more frequently than they currently are. And the reason for that is it helps them on financial flexibility. I would -- I believe that within a period of time, I don't know if it's 5 years or 10 years, that this will obviously become the norm and the expectation of all people who work for companies. From our perspective, when you've completed a day of work, you've earned that money, it's yours. The continuous calculation allows us to calculate the net earnings for the employee, and our back office has the sophistication that we can do the same-day remittances and the money movement. So there's no technical reason why you can't offer this benefit to workers today. 
Raimo Lenschow: Yes. Okay. And then on that note, like -- and it's -- I mean I don't want to get too technical on the earnings call, but like some of your competitors are starting to say, like, "oh, we're going to do continues." Can you just remind us like how different is it in terms of on a technical setup to be able to do continuous versus kind of the old approach? 
David Ossip: Well, there's continuous and then there's doing it properly. In order to do continuous calculations, you have to have a very robust time and attendance engine, and that means that you can do sophisticated calculations like retroactive adjustments. So if you make a change backwards in time during the calculation and determining the amount of money that you have to top the employer, if you change a time code from paid to unpaid or unpaid to paid, you have to recalculate that. You have to have the benefit side and the HR side working as well because it's not just time records that can lead to a change in the current period. And to do that requires a design from the very beginning that you're going to do that type of calculation. So for the others to do that, I think they would have to first build very robust time and attendance, which, as you know, there aren't many vendors out there that offer the same type of functionality that we do on the workforce management side. They would have to do the proper benefit, benefit eligibility, types of calculations that you'd have to do as well, build out the full HR module and then also build out their payroll engine. And even if they do that, they then have to develop the back end to do the tax calculations and the various remittances for the tens of thousands jurisdictions that are out there. So I think it's quite complicated to do, and I think it would take a long time for people to do it as well. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Merwin with Goldman Sachs. 
Christopher Merwin: Okay. David, do you mind talking about how implementations are going, in particular, for strategic accounts for those sort of taking place on time, just given I know that there can be some bigger projects? And also, as we look to the fourth quarter, should we think about more strategic accounts going live and potentially seeing a tailwind to revenue per customer there? 
David Ossip: So the -- so I think that the segment is actually enterprise accounts. The implementations appear to be going quite well. From our perspective, we meet on a biweekly basis where each of our segment leads gives us the forecast for both the go-lives and their project kickoffs in the particular quarter, and we monitor it very, very carefully. And when we do the planning, especially with the enterprise accounts, you sometimes get more motors because of the size of accounts and the nonprogram management you have to put on to the account in addition to things like project management. So the accounts typically are managed very, very nicely. And from the customer side, you typically have larger client team. You often have third-party resources harping on the program management and the project management side. So we feel quite comfortable with that particular segment. There are some enterprise customers going live. And as I said earlier, you would expect to see some impact from the enterprise accounts in 2020. 
Christopher Merwin: Okay, great. And then just as it relates to international, and I know you talked before about how investment there is going to be a mix between M&A and, I guess, organic. But as you think about getting into 20 countries and the OpEx required, I mean how do we think about that impacting the margin trajectory over the long term? And how are you going to manage that? 
David Ossip: So if you were to ask me where we focus on, we focus really on the gross profit on recurring more than we do anything else. And if I look at this particular quarter, we know that the gross profit on recurring went up by 440 basis points year-over-year. If I look at Q3, it went up by 370 basis points. If I look at Q1, it went up by 320 basis points. And that's where we get the most leverage as we scale the business. And so you'll continue to see the gross profit on recurring improve. In terms of overall investment, we will focus on growth of the organization foremost, but at the same time, we would expect to see the gross profit on recurring go up. And then on the remainder, we will take that and determine how much we'll invest that into new markets versus into profitability. 
Operator: And our last question comes from Drew Kootman with Cantor Fitzgerald. 
Drew Kootman: So you've talked a lot about the Wallet and everything. I was just curious if you could talk about what you guys see moving forward as far as the pipeline or -- for products or applications? 
David Ossip: Well, every year, we release probably 2 to 3 new modules. The next module that will be taken to -- that will become GA is engagement surveys and pulse surveys, and that will be in the next release. We will begin -- we've already begun showing that to our customers, and we expect that we'll have obviously a positive impact on the PEPM that we get from our customers. We are also beginning to release plus modules for the existing features. We have recruiting, recruiting plus benefits, benefit plus, where we're able to go back to the existing base and increase the PEPM we get for those modules as well as for new customers get a higher PEPM just to begin. So you'll continue to see those types of investments going forward. 
Drew Kootman: Great. And then just curious on how retention rates look when you go to the enterprise client and just how it impacts the total, either positive or negative? 
David Ossip: We don't break out retention based on segment. And we gave guidance this year between 95% and 97%, and we're tracking right in the middle for that as expected. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-30 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Chantal, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Ceridian HCM Holding Inc. Second Quarter 2019 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Jeremy Johnson, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. 
Jeremy Johnson: Thank you, and good evening. On the call today, we have Ceridian's CEO, David Ossip; and CFO, Arthur Gitajn. Before we begin, allow me to provide a disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements.
 This call, including the Q&A portion, may include forward-looking statements about our current and future outlook, guidance, plans, expectations and intentions, results, levels of activities, performance, goals or achievements or any other future events or developments.

As a reminder, all figures discussed on this conference call are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.
 With that, I will turn the call over to David. 
David Ossip: Thanks, Jeremy. Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. We are pleased with the results from the second quarter of 2019. Dayforce momentum remained strong, with Dayforce recurring revenue growing by 31% and 32% on a constant currency basis. Total Dayforce revenue, including professional services and other, increased by 27% year-over-year and 28% on a constant currency basis. Including Powerpay, Cloud revenue grew by 22% and 24% on a constant currency basis.
 Moving on to customer count, we ended the quarter with 4,006 customers live on the Dayforce platform, a net increase of 155 customers from the first quarter of 2019 and a net increase of 698 customers since June 30, 2018. Consistent with the first quarter, we continue to see a higher mix of larger-sized customers taken live compared to the second quarter of last year, and we expect this trend to continue as demand for our product continues to be strong in both our major and enterprise markets. 
 From a profitability standpoint, we are pleased that Cloud recurring services gross margin expanded 370 basis points year-over-year to 69.3%, and professional services and other gross margin improved from negative 15.6% to negative 4.3%, nearing our breakeven target. Adjusted EBITDA was $44 million, an increase of 23% compared to last year. And adjusted EBITDA margin was 22.4%, an increase of 230 basis points compared to last year. Arthur will go into more detail on the financials, but I will briefly highlight the 2 areas of investment we have discussed on prior earnings calls: product development and sales and marketing. 
 During the second quarter, we continued our investment in product development. Our cash investment in product development, including research and development expense and capitalized software development, was $15.6 million or 7.9% of revenue, an increase of 11% compared to the second quarter of 2018. A portion of the spend was related to our global expansion. As you know, we have recently launched U.K. and Australia native Dayforce payroll, and we are seeing strong demand in those countries. We plan to start our Dayforce Ireland native payroll in August 2019 with the full product launch by the end of this year. This will complete the Dayforce native payroll expansion into the U.K. and Ireland region. Early next year, we anticipate a similar rollout for New Zealand native payroll to complete the ANZ region. 
 We also invested in sales and marketing during the second quarter, which increased by approximately $5 million to 17.8% of revenue. This represents a continuation of our investments to grow in the enterprise segment and to grow in global territories. Also during the quarter, we announced our selection as a successful Gate 3 supplier by the Government of Canada. This announcement followed an exhaustive procurement process, and as a result of our selection, we have signed a contract with the Government of Canada enabling us to bid for the government's future payroll, time and HCM against 2 other vendors. We believe that we are uniquely qualified and well positioned to replace the government's existing system, and to deliver on-time and accurate payroll to the more than 300,000 federal employees in Canada. We will continue to keep you updated on the progress of this opportunity, which is expected to positively impact results in 2020 and future years.
 Leveraging the knowledge and experience we acquired in our successful pursuit of the Government of Canada opportunity, and given the wealth of public sector opportunities in North America, we are creating a new public sector vertical inside our enterprise segment. You may recall that we announced our verticalized approach to the enterprise segment when we reported our fourth quarter 2018 results with the creation of 4 verticals: manufacturing, health and human services, financial services, retail and hospitality. The public sector vertical will be our fifth vertical, and we believe that Dayforce's ability to handle the most complex workforce scenarios, combined with our intuitive user interface, positions us for continued success in the public sector. 
 In the second quarter, we continued to see strong demand from enterprise customers, and I want to spend a few minutes highlighting some of those wins, beginning with the traction we saw in our global markets. In the U.K., we won a deal with the second-largest coffee shop chain in the world. They have 18,000 U.K.-based employees and a vision plan for global growth. They were looking for a single HCM platform to replace their legacy HR and payroll system and needed a partner that can move at a fast pace to support a rapid go-live plan and provide real-time insights and greater cost control. The company was already using Dayforce for workforce management and has seen a high level of adoption from employees, which generated 8.5 million mobile sessions per year.
 Another great win was an Australian facilities management company with more than 13,000 employees across 5 continents. This company was looking to simplify its process and improve compliance while reducing the burden on their IT team to manage disparate systems. They chose Dayforce because they needed a full end-to-end solution that could be rolled out globally, and they will be deploying the full Dayforce platform including payroll, time, advanced workforce management, recruiting, document management, dashboards, performance, compensation management, learning and succession planning.
 In North America, this quarter, we signed a deal with a 20,000-employee manufacturer of exterior building products that was a result of a recent merger of 2 smaller companies. The smaller company with 5,000 employees was on the full Dayforce HCM suite, while the larger 15,000-employee unit was using a solution from 2 vendors for payroll and time and attendance. They formed a cross-functional team to determine whether to move the full company to Dayforce or to the other payroll vendor. The company chose Dayforce because of its single database and its single rule engine, which proved to be the most effective option for handling the unique needs of the 25 legal entities, each with different rules. One of the key decision factors for the company was the relative ease with which our technology and services team can support
 [Audio Gap]
 continued growth from acquisitions.
 In our financial service segment, we closed a deal with a prominent New York City-based financial services company with more than 14,000 employees. The company was processing payroll for the U.S., Canada and the U.K. with an in-house legacy ERP system, and they chose Dayforce for our continuous calculation capability which gives them visibility throughout the entire payroll cycle across all countries with real-time orders previews and the highest level of payroll accuracy. Dayforce gives them peace of mind as they navigate an increasingly complex regulatory environment. 
 And in our new enterprise public sector vertical, we signed a contract with a large Midwestern U.S. city. In this case, the city's auditor had identified significant compliance and technology risks associated with the city's current antiquated system. In the end, we beat out a modern ERP vendor which will help the city and its 10,000 employees move to Dayforce pay benefits and workforce management along with dashboards and document management. 
 Finally, I'm also pleased to announce that for the fifth consecutive year, Nucleus Research has named Dayforce a leader in their workforce management matrix. 
 I will now turn it over to Arthur to discuss our financial results and guidance with you in greater detail. 
Arthur Gitajn: Thank you, David, and good evening, everyone. I'm going to take a few minutes to talk about our second quarter 2019 financial results, then I'll provide guidance for the third quarter of 2019 and for the full year. To help investors and others to assess how the underlying business is performing excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we've included a schedule of our financial results on a constant currency basis in both our Q2 earnings release and in the Management Discussion and Analysis section of our Form 10-Q filed earlier today. In addition, we added a reconciliation of reported net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income in our Q2 earnings release. 
 Starting with our second quarter 2019 financial results. Revenue from our flagship Cloud HCM platform Dayforce increased by $28.7 million or 27.1% to $144.5 million. On a constant currency basis, Dayforce revenue increased 28%. Revenue from Powerpay, our Cloud HR and payroll solution for the Canadian small business market, declined 1.4% to $21.2 million. On a constant currency basis, excluding the impact of a 3.6% decline in the value of the Canadian dollar, Powerpay revenue was up 2.3%.
 Cloud revenue, which includes both Dayforce and Powerpay, increased by $28.4 million or 22.3% to $155.7 million. On a constant currency basis, Cloud revenue increased 23.7%. Total revenue, which includes revenue from both our Cloud and Bureau solutions, increased by $17.3 million or 9.7% to $196.3 million, and on a constant currency basis, total revenue increased 10.9%.
 Comparing second quarter Cloud revenue to first quarter Cloud revenue sequentially, as we've discussed in the past, there's some seasonality to our business. This year, we benefited from approximately $5.8 million in Cloud revenue in the first quarter that did not reoccur in the second quarter. Of this $5.8 million, $3.2 million was related to W-2 and T4 tax forms in the U.S. and Canada, about $2 million in Dayforce recurring revenue and $1 million in Powerpay recurring revenue. In addition, we benefited from $2.6 million in float income, virtually all of which was reflected in Dayforce recurring revenue related to higher average float balances in the first quarter as a result of timing of year-end bonus processing, tax filings and higher employee counts. Excluding the seasonality impacts from Q1 results, on a constant currency basis, second quarter Cloud revenue would have been up by $7.3 million and second quarter Dayforce recurring revenue would have been up by $4.2 million compared to the first quarter.
 Our guidance for 2019 assumed a U.S. dollar to Canadian dollar exchange rate of $1.30. The Canadian dollar weakened against the U.S. dollar during the second quarter. And although the Canadian dollar strengthened in June and ended the quarter at $1.31, the average exchange rate for the quarter was just under $1.34. Even with the weaker Canadian dollar, which had the effect of reducing Cloud revenue by $1.4 million, Cloud revenue came in at the high end of our $154 million to $156 million guidance range; and on a constant currency basis, Cloud revenue exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $1.1 million. Total revenue exceeded the high end of our $191 million to $193 million guidance range by $3.3 million and by $5 million on a constant currency basis. And adjusted EBITDA exceeded the high end of our $37 million to $39 million guidance range by $5 million, primarily due to solid revenue results.
 Cloud revenue growth in the second quarter was driven by a 24.3% increase in Cloud recurring services revenue and a 15.3% increase in Cloud professional services and other revenue. Of the $28.4 million increase in total Cloud revenue, $4.3 million or 15% was attributable to Bureau customers migrating to Dayforce. Excluding the impact of migrations to Dayforce, revenue from Bureau solutions declined by $6.8 million or 13.2% which was in line with our expectations.
 Cloud revenue accounted for 79% of our total revenue in the second quarter of 2019 compared to 71% in the second quarter of 2018. The average float balance for our customer trust funds during the second quarter was approximately $3.39 billion, compared to $3.35 billion in the second quarter last year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, the average float balance for our customer trust funds grew 2.7% year-over-year. The average yield on our float balance was 2.41% during the second quarter of 2019, an increase of 47 basis points compared to the average yield in the second quarter of 2018. As a result, income from invested customer trust funds was $20.3 million in the second quarter compared to $16.2 million in the second quarter last year. The balance sheet value of customer trust funds as of June 30, 2019, was $4 billion compared to $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2018. The increase in the June 30, 2019 balance sheet value of customer trust funds reflects the fact that the last business day of Q2 was a Friday, while the last business day of Q4 2018 was a Monday, and Friday balances are generally higher than Monday balances.
 We continued to expand on gross margin during the second quarter. While Cloud recurring services revenue grew $24.1 million and 24.3%, our cost of Cloud recurring services to support this growth increased by only $3.7 million or 10.9%, and our gross margin on Cloud recurring services increased from 65.6% in the second quarter last year to 69.3%, reflecting an increase in the proportion of Dayforce customers live for more than 2 years from 61% in the second quarter last year to 67%, and also our ability to continue to realize economies of scale in customer support and hosting costs.
 Our negative gross margin on professional services and other improved from negative 15.6% in the second quarter last year to negative 4.3% due to productivity improvements in implementing new customers, reflecting the increased experience of our implementation consultants and the continued use of automation in our implementation processes. As we discussed on previous earnings calls, we stepped up our investments in research and development and in sales and marketing in the second half last year, and our second quarter results reflect these initiatives. Product development and management expenses increased by $1.3 million or 8.6% to $16.4 million. Total selling, general and administrative expense was reduced by $11.6 million or 14.3% to $69.3 million, primarily due to costs in Q2 2018 related to our IPO and debt refinancing that were not incurred in Q2 2019. Excluding IPO-related expense, share-based compensation and other expenses that are excluded from adjusted EBITDA, selling, general and administrative expense increased $7 million, reflecting increased sales and marketing expenses of $6.2 million or 23%.
 We realized an operating profit of $18.7 million in the second quarter compared to an operating loss of $8.4 million in the second quarter last year. After adjusting for IPO-related expense, share-based compensation and other items that are excluded from adjusted EBITDA, operating profit was up 37.7%. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $8.1 million or 22.6% to $44 million, and adjusted EBITDA margin increased approximately 230 basis points from 20.1% to 22.4%. 
 Diluted net income per share was $0.04 in the second quarter this year compared to a diluted net loss per share of $0.58 in the second quarter last year. And adjusted diluted net income per share was $0.12 in the second quarter this year compared to diluted net income per share of 0 in the second quarter last year, reflecting reduced interest expense primarily from the redemption of the senior notes during the second quarter last year and improved profitability.
 Moving to the balance sheet. As of June 30, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $237.9 million, an increase of $20.1 million compared to December 31, 2018. And our total debt was $667.5 million as of June 30, 2019, a reduction of $2.8 million compared to December 31, 2018. The $20.1 million increase in cash was primarily attributable to adjusted EBITDA and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under share-based compensation plans, partially offset by capital expenditures, cash taxes, interest, annual incentive plan payments, prepaid expenses and the benefits decision support acquisition in the first quarter.
 Our capital expenditures in Q2 2019 were $12.5 million compared to $8.5 million in Q2 2018. Included in the $12.5 million in capital expenditures were $3.7 million for property and equipment and $8.8 million for software and technology, of which $7.5 million was capitalized software development, an increase of $2.3 million compared to Q2 2018.
 Turning now to our outlook for the third quarter and full year fiscal 2019. Given that second quarter total revenue exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $3.3 million and by $5 million on a constant currency basis, and that adjusted EBITDA exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $5 million, we gave a lot of thought to raising our full year guidance in consideration of second quarter results. But while the business continues to perform well, there's a lot of uncertainty around the timing and magnitude of prospective Federal Reserve Board actions to reduce the Federal discount rate in the next 5 months. As we've discussed before, each 100 basis point change in interest rates is estimated to have a $17 million impact on float revenue over the ensuing 12 months. So for example, a 25 basis point reduction at the end of July, and another 25 basis point reduction in the middle of September, would result in an estimated $3 million reduction in float revenue and adjusted EBITDA relative to our assumptions when we provided full year guidance last quarter.
 So given our overperformance in the second quarter, but assuming 2 Federal Reserve Board discount rate cuts of 25 basis points each in the second half, for the full year 2019, our overperformance in Q2 enables us to reaffirm the full year ranges we provided on February 6, 2019 for Cloud revenue, total revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Specifically, on a constant currency basis, we expect Cloud revenue to be in the range of $655 million to $660 million, an increase of 24% to 24.9% on a constant currency basis; total revenue to be in the range of $810 million to $815 million, an increase of 9.4% to 10.1% on a constant currency basis; and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $182 million to $187 million or an increase of 13.3% to 16.4% year-over-year.
 For the third quarter 2019, we expect Cloud revenue to be in the range of $162 million to $164 million, an increase of 22.8% to 24.3% on a constant currency basis. As we discussed on the call last quarter, if you assume that Powerpay grows in the low single digits, our third quarter and full year guidance imply that Dayforce revenue will grow 29% to 31% on a constant currency basis in the second half of the year. For the third quarter, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $195 million to $197 million, an increase of 9.3% to 10.4% on a constant currency basis; and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $41 million to $43 million or an increase of 12.6% to 18.1% year-over-year.
 At this time, I'm going to hand back to the operator for any questions. Thank you. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Michael Turrin with Deutsche Bank. 
Michael Turrin: Dayforce recurring grew 31%. Total Dayforce was up 28% in constant currency. You're expecting that number to reaccelerate in the back half of the year. Can you just walk through some of the factors giving you confidence there? Is there anything you can add at all in terms of pipeline or visibility for more color? 
David Ossip: Yes. So I appreciate the question. Hope you're well. So if you actually did the back of the envelope math and you're assuming that our Powerpay revenue grows, say, anywhere between, say, 2% to 4% for the remainder of the year, you can basically work out that we'll end off the year pretty much close on Dayforce revenue growth around 30%. And given that we're at 28.6% and 28% for the first 2 quarters of the year, it means that we should be seeing a number somewhere, say, between 28% and 29% in Q3, expanding above 30% in Q4. We've also discussed beforehand that when we talk about the modeling of our revenue and the guidance we give to the market, we do a bottom-up approach by taking the accounts that we have already kicked off. In other words, they are currently going through implementation. We have our projected go-live dates for those accounts, and we build up a number from that. So we have a high degree of confidence in the Dayforce growth numbers for the remainder of the year. In other words, just to be clear, we do project, and we have put it in the press release, an acceleration of Dayforce revenue growth in the remainder of the year. 
Michael Turrin: That's helpful. And with Dayforce now set to go live in Ireland, can you remind us where we are in terms of international expansion? We know it's still early in terms of those new markets, but how repeatable is that playbook going forward as you look to expand into additional territories? 
David Ossip: So I'll start with the first. We now have native capability in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Ireland and Australia. We will have New Zealand for the beginning of next year. In terms of Ireland, we're about to start the go-sell of Ireland payroll, so we should begin to see accounts in the remainder of the year. We've been very pleased with the wins that we've been having in both the U.K. and the Australian market. In the press release, I discussed that we had won a 18,000 -- a U.K. employee customer in the hospitality -- regional hospitality arena. And as well, we won a 13,000-employee organization in Australia. So we're seeing great traction in both of those countries.
 We believe the model is very repeatable. As we've spoken about beforehand, it takes us about a year or so to build out the native payroll capabilities on the Dayforce platform. We already have the native workforce management capabilities, HR capabilities and talent capabilities. We've already localized the product in close to 30 different languages. And so we believe we can continue expanding the payroll footprint in terms of native capability on a regular basis going forward. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. 
Mark Murphy: Congrats on the strong results in Q2. David, I believe you started investing a bit more aggressively in sales and marketing roughly a year ago. I'm curious, as you reflect back on those investments, where have you seen the greatest returns? And at this point, are you emboldened to invest incrementally along those lines in the next 12 months? 
David Ossip: So let's just look at it from a kind of a non-GAAP basis of actual expenses. We can see that if I go to Q2 of last year, my sales and marketing expense was 15.1%. We have increased that by 180 basis points to 16.9% year-over-year. Again, that's on kind of a non-GAAP basis. I would say we are very pleased with the returns that we're getting. We measure the returns in terms of pipeline growth, which we've seen great pipeline growth for the incremental spend. We've seen, as I've mentioned before, in terms of Q3, Q4, Q1, Q2, we've had very strong sales. So in terms of taking the pipeline and actually translating that into sales, we've been very, very pleased. You'll see continued investments inside the sales and marketing arena. 
 Now in addition to the increase in spend, we've also discussed beforehand that we've done some internal allocation changes as well where, effectively, we did take out some layers in the sales organization, did an allocation of staff into more direct sellers as opposed to support sales organization. In the enterprise segment, we discussed before we made investments in a number of different verticals, retail and hospitality, financial services, manufacturing, health care, and more recently, we've now started to invest in the government sector as well. 
Mark Murphy: Okay. And as a follow-up, David, it appears certainly, the payroll industry is taking notice of several of your innovations. I wanted to ask you just regarding your vision of On-Demand Pay, how many companies and prospects do you sense today that are moving forward with that activity versus perhaps some who may want to learn more about the compliance side and the overall feasibility of that equation for their business? 
David Ossip: So we -- as you know, we don't give kind of module counts to the actual market. We do see strong demand for the on-demand features inside the application. In terms of innovation, we believe we are differentiated in that when an employee does a request, we do a same-day pay. So we do not loan the employee money. Instead, we actually pay the employee, which is quite differentiated. And that leverages the continuous calculation engine that we have across payroll and time.
 I believe that in the long term, that there is a very strong upside to the business through what we can do in terms of the On-Demand Pay and some of the other features that we're building alongside that. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. 
Raimo Lenschow: Quick congrats from me as well. David, if I look at the news flow across the sector, there's more and more cases of some of your competitors having issues on the payroll side in terms of getting accurate numbers out, et cetera. Are you seeing that in terms of pipeline build, et cetera? And especially, I'm thinking like as you kind of -- a good few of the examples are going upmarket, is that kind of where we should kind of see you, that you're kind of being able to handle bigger and bigger accounts, and hence, you shouldn't really be kind of in that classic element -- segment that you used to be? 
David Ossip: So I'm not sure where your question came from on the first side, as we're not seeing -- we're only seeing positive trends on the payroll side in the segments that we actually play in. Just to remind you that we typically -- our major market segment begins at around 700 employees and goes to about 6,000 employees. Our enterprise segment starts above 6,000 employees. We obviously have made a little bit of a shift more towards enterprise accounts basically because we didn't have an enterprise segment before they joined us, so there's only upwards to go.
 In terms of the capabilities of the actual product, we've spoken about it before. It was designed to be global and highly scalable from the very onset. I spoke a bit about before that we built the product to go up and down market on a single code base, which obviously gives us great leverage. And you see that -- if you look at our R&D spend on a cash basis, we come in at about 7.9%, which I would argue, is substantially lower than any other player inside the industry. We are still confident about the market. And as I mentioned, we expect to see an acceleration of Dayforce revenue in the latter half of the year. 
Raimo Lenschow: Perfect. Yes. Congrats. Makes sense. Okay. I was talking more about the competition though, but yes. 
David Ossip: I think we're doing quite nicely, but I can't speak to the competitors. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. 
Mark Marcon: Congrats. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the initiative with Canada and how we should think about that, both in terms of just what it ended up proving about your capabilities both in terms of time and attendance and workforce planning as well as payroll and how we should think about that government vertical because that is newer. 
David Ossip: So let me start at the end. We already have had success in government. In the press release, we spoke about a 10,000-employee municipal government that we got inside the actual quarter. In terms of the Government of Canada, let me answer from a number of different aspects. First, we are exceptionally proud that we were a successful bidder for the replacement of the Phoenix payroll system for the Government of Canada employees. What that means is that we have -- we are allowed to bid on what the government terms, the task assignments or the pieces of work that they are going to bid out in the future, and we expect those to start probably over the next 12 months.
 What the successful bid means to the organization is, first, the government did a extensive evaluation of all of the players in the market. The gates that we had to go through were highly technical and were very comprehensive. They covered all aspects of our capabilities, from a compliance calculations perspective to scalability, security, accessibility, et cetera, and we came through that with flying colors. That gives evidence to the market that we are a very viable player for the large enterprise segment, and as well, we are a very viable player for government organizations, which for us, expands our addressable market. So we're delighted with the progress. And for all of the employees and our partners that are listening to the call, a very big thanks to everyone who's involved. I do believe it is something we should all be very proud of. 
Mark Marcon: How should we think about the TAM of that vertical, David? 
David Ossip: Well, I think you could basically look at it from a perspective of employment numbers in the overall North American and global market. But obviously, it could be a significant expansion to the growth of the business. However, I would caution you that we do not expect to see this to be material for a number of years. 
Mark Marcon: Yes, it sounds like it's going to take a few years in terms of when it all gets proved out. But it sounds like you're in a really good position on a number of modules that you're best-in-breed in. 
David Ossip: Exactly. But also, it opens up the possibility of us actually participating in other state and provincial payroll and time projects. As well as I mentioned, it does give us a significant stamp of quality and proof for the large enterprise market. And as well, I think it has validated our technology to many of the big system integrators, which we're also very pleased with. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Crédit Suisse. 
Bhavin Shah: This is Bhavin on for Brad. David, at your recent HCM Summit in New York, you kind of mentioned that you view employee engagement trends as a looking glass into where the business is going. What have you seen this quarter that gets you excited about the future? And then on the flip side, what makes you want to work harder to improve? 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this is the operator. I apologize, there'll be a slight delay in today's conference. Please hold and the conference will resume momentarily. Thank you for your patience. 
 [Technical Difficulty] 
Jeremy Johnson: This is the Ceridian team again. We're rejoining. Apologies, we got dropped here. 
Operator: Brad Zelnick, your line is open for questions. 
Bhavin Shah: Sorry about that. This is Bhavin on for Brad. David, at your recent HCM Summit in New York, you mentioned that you view employee engagement trends as a looking glass into where the business is going. What have you seen this quarter that gets you excited about the future? And on the flip side, what have you seen that wants -- makes you work harder to improve? 
David Ossip: Wow, that's quite a question. So let me just start speaking about employee engagement. The belief that we have at Ceridian is that if we take an employee approach first, and we make sure that we have a best environment for our employees in terms of workplace flexibility, equality and fairness, it creates the right environment that optimizes the customer experience. And we've seen evidence about that over the last number of years that I've spoken to, that as you've seen our engagement numbers increase and become best-in-class. We've seen a corresponding increase in our customer satisfaction scores, as measured by NPS. And we're a perfect example of how using our product, Dayforce, to really foster employee engagement, leads to a much better client experience and true business results. And the business results, obviously, you can look at the particular quarter in terms of Dayforce growth of 28%, up on constant currency by about 31%. You've seen a significant improvement in EBITDA, up by about 230 basis points. You've seen the Dayforce recurring. Our numbers go up by 370 basis points. And you've seen a great improvement as well in our professional services gross margin. So we'll maintain a constant focus on employee engagement, making sure that we have a best workplace for our entire team. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Chris Merwin with Goldman Sachs. 
Unknown Analyst: This is [ Kevin ] on for Chris. David, you've talked about, in the past, about new features that are going to come online for the Powerpay business, which could potentially accelerate growth. Moving forward, how do you think about the mix of growth coming from upselling additional modules versus new customer adds? 
David Ossip: So a lot of it actually comes from going back to the actual base and upselling the actual modules. We believe that the new modules could add a lift of probably low double-digit in terms of ACV growth for the Powerpay business. So we do believe, as I've mentioned before, that we can take the Powerpay business growth rate into the high single digits and aspirationally into the very low double digits over time. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Anubhav Mehla with Jefferies. 
Anubhav Mehla: The first one, just going back to the Canadian government contract. If you -- I know you talked about it a little bit there. But what are kind of the next steps and the time lines and how should we think about that? Like when does that actually translate into like a contract? And what specifically are they looking for at this point? 
David Ossip: Well, the -- most of this is public, and the Government of Canada has done kind of a press conference on the actual project, and they've spoken a lot about it publicly. The government is looking for a next-generation pay and HR system to replace the Phoenix system, which has been quite challenged for the approximately 300,000 employees of the Canadian government.
 The next step, our understanding, is that the government will proceed to pilot in a number of technologies for certain populations and functionality with inside the government. And just given the change management and the data cleansing kind of exercises, we expect that, that would take probably about 1 year, 1.5 years for the government to go through that. At which point, the government will be in a position to do awards of the contract to 1 or multiple of the 3 vendors. 
Anubhav Mehla: Okay. That was very helpful. And just as a follow-up on your float balance, like, I saw that grew around 1%. And just trying to understand basically what are the drivers and how should we think about that going forward, given that the rates are probably going down here? 
David Ossip: Yes. So the float balances, on a constant currency basis, are up by 3%. Remember that you've got probably about 1/3 of the float balance or so would be in Canadian dollars. The average float balance is somewhat of a cyclical nature in terms of high and low years, and we are in a slightly lower year as opposed to last year.
 In terms of the actual yield, at the moment, we're yielding about 240 basis points, 241 basis points, on the actual float. In the guidance numbers, we have assumed that there will be a rate reduction tomorrow in the Fed meeting. And as well, we have also included a second rate reduction later in the year at the next Fed meeting, with inside our actual guidance numbers. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi. 
Walter Pritchard: Arthur, I wonder if you could talk to, as it relates to float revenue and your thinking around the bottom line? And you've made some investments in the last year, and some of the float revenue has helped offset the investments you've made, higher float revenue. I'm wondering if as you get into a situation where float revenue is a little lower, how do you think about that moderating? Or do you think about moderating or maintaining your levels of investments if that happens? 
Arthur Gitajn: So first of all, I would just say float revenue is an attractive feature of our business. It's not our core business, but it's a nice aspect of the business. And as David mentioned, as I mentioned in the comments, we've taken down our forecast for float revenue based on the expectation that we're going to have a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate tomorrow, and then another one in September. And you can do the math from our 100 basis point equals $17 million. If you take those 2, we estimate that would be an impact of about $3 million. Because of our overperformance in Q2, we're able, as a result of the overperformance, to maintain our guidance for the year despite the reduction in the forecast for float revenue. 
Walter Pritchard: And then going forward, does that have much of an impact on how you think about investing? Or is this -- I mean, obviously, interest rates are volatile. Given there's not much you can do about it, just curious how you think about it philosophically beyond the second half. 
Arthur Gitajn: We haven't, really, beyond the second half. I mean I don't know how long we'll continue to be in a what's historically a low interest rate environment. But we're continuing to grow. We're growing profitably. We're expanding margins, even with low interest rates. And if you assume that there's a greater likelihood longer range that rates go up rather than down, we stand to benefit. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Scott Berg with Needham. 
Scott Berg: Congrats on your good quarter. I guess just one question from me, briefly. David, with your success up market, do you think that -- would you, I guess, would you attribute that to more just focus on these larger customers? Or is there something in the product innovation path, maybe over the last 12 to 24 months, that's benefiting some of those larger deals and your win rates? 
David Ossip: There are a few pieces. The continuous calculation capability resonates tremendously well as employee population sizes increase. Effectively, the fact that we continue to calculate the net earnings allows the payroll people to access the pay information during the active pay period, which gives them much more time to review the data and make any necessary correction, which yields a much higher and more compliant payroll. So we start with a strength of product. 
 The second piece is that with Leagh joining the organization about 10 months ago, we changed our go-to-market strategy in the enterprise segment where we started focusing on a number of specific verticals. And for each of those different verticals, we identified and quantified the value that our product delivers with inside that particular industry. And we trained our salespeople and developed the appropriate marketing material to convey that messaging. And we've continued doing that in a much more disciplined approach by bringing on more senior people with very deep domain expertise. We've done that now in each of the different verticals. The most recent one would be inside the government sector where we brought -- where we are bringing on board the chief of staff for the Minister of Innovation in Canada who obviously has very deep domain knowledge about the workings of government organizations, and we believe that he'll be very instrumental in making sure that we convey value correctly to that particular industry. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Richard Davis with Canaccord. 
Richard Davis: In terms of kind of how you think about expanding the product, how do you think about the demarcation between kind of your core expertise in HCM and kind of what's called skill development or training, e-learning and those kind of things? Is that something that's just too far afield? Is it something you should partner? Is it something that over time, you should develop because well-trained employees obviously are more engaged, stick around and are more valuable? So I'm just trying to kind of think about where that line blurs and where it doesn't blur. 
David Ossip: So I think you're aware that starting in 2015, we started to expand the product feature set into very rich talent capabilities. Today I believe we have probably the widest platform on the market in terms of full HCM capabilities. We have very successful recruiting. Our recruiting leads to employee onboarding. We have strong performance management, compensation management. Last year, we launched learning management. Related to learning management would be the content delivery for the actual customers, and in time, we do see that as an area we can expand into. 
Richard Davis: And then a quick follow-up, you're one of the few HCM firms with kind of native mobile functionality. Am I able to get some of those learning modules mobile? I assume the answer is yes, but I just wanted to check on that. 
David Ossip: Yes. If you go to the Apple or the Android store, you'll see the Dayforce Learning mobile app that's now available. We have it as a separate mobile app because of the fact that people often like to go through the content when they're in subways or areas that don't have connectivity. So there's a local data store that we use for those particular apps. 
 By the way, just speaking on mobile apps, we believe we've now exceeded, I think it is -- is it -- god, I think it's over 1 billion mobile transactions on our native mobile platform over the last -- I think we passed it in the last quarter. So these mobile apps are used constantly. And if you look at our ratings on the Apple store, the Android store, I believe our product ratings are around 4.4, which are very, very strong as well. 
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-05-01 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Jesse, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Ceridian HCM Holding Inc.

As a reminder, all figures discussed on this conference call are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.
 With that I will turn the call over to David. 
David Ossip: Thanks, Jeremy. Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. We are pleased with the results from the first quarter of 2019. During the first quarter, Dayforce momentum remained strong with revenue growing by 28% year-over-year and 29% on a constant currency basis. Including Powerpay, sales revenue grew by 22% to 24% on a constant-currency basis. We are also pleased that Cloud were -- gross margin expanded by 320 basis points to 70.1%; and professional services and other gross margin also improved from negative 17.6% to negative 14.2%.
 During the quarter, we added approximately 90 new implementation employees to keep pace with our strong sales performance, which has continued through the first quarter of 2019. We ended the quarter with 3,851 customers live on the Dayforce platform, a net increase of 133 customers from the fourth quarter of 2018 and a net increase of 697 customers since March 31, 2018.
 This quarter, we saw a higher mix of larger sized customers taken live compared to the first quarter last year, and we expect this trend to continue as demand for our product continues to be strong in both major and enterprise markets. Arthur will go into more details on the financials but I will briefly highlight the 2 areas of investment we have discussed on prior earnings calls: product development and sales and marketing.
 During the first quarter, we continued our investments in product development. Our cash investment in product development, including research and development expense and capitalized software development, was $15.1 million or 7.4% of revenue, an increase of 80 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2018. We launched Australian-native payroll and recently hosted our first Australian sales summit. We believe that Dayforce can fill the gap in the marketplace by providing a single human capital management solution for this market.
 Australian payroll, along with U.S., Canada, U.K. and our best-in-class workforce management capabilities, gives us what we believe to be one of the broadest global solutions in the marketplace. And as we have said before, we expect to continue to add countries at the pace of 1 to 2 per year with Ireland and New Zealand as our next planned rollouts.
 We also announced the release of Dayforce version 56, which includes Dayforce benefits decision support, Dayforce voice assistant and Dayforce On-Demand Pay. We believe these product enhancements will broaden our human capital management functionality, enable us to sell additional functionality to new and existing customers and improve our pricing in the marketplace.
 We also invested in sales and marketing during the first quarter, which increased by approximately $6 million to 17.3 of revenue. This represents a continuation of our investments to grow in enterprise segments and our global expansion.
 In the first quarter, we continue to see strong demand from enterprise customers, and I want to spend a few minutes highlighting some of those wins, beginning with traction we saw in our global markets. G8 Education, a leading Australian provider of development and childcare services with more than 11,000 employees, selected Dayforce for our ability to transform their manual processes to better engage their workforce and deliver return on investment. 
 In South Africa, we won a large global retailer with dozens of brands in over 3,000 stores in 32 countries. They wanted to improve their workforce management and labor planning and provide better employee experience. They were struggling with old tech and old processes and were looking for a new solution. We beat both local and global competitors, and ultimately won because of having the best fit and the strongest return on investment for them choosing Dayforce. There is also a follow-on opportunity around talent that we are currently pursuing, which is a great expansion opportunity.
 I would now like to highlight some of the key wins we had in North America this quarter. In our Health and Human Services segment, we signed a large health care company comprised of 8 different hospital groups, with over 20 hospitals and 20,000 employees. Each group was on a different payroll system. Some of which were big competitors and some of which were archaic in-house systems. They wanted to centralize payroll and standardize processes across the entire organization and needed a vendor that could handle their complex need. We are able to bring their payroll under one system with Dayforce.
 In the retail and hospitality vertical, we won a popular quick service restaurant with over 13,000 employees. They wanted a single platform for the full human capital management suite to replace the legacy payroll system and a homegrown workforce management system. Dayforce's continuous calculation engine will allow them to shorten net pay processes by a day, which will reduce the need for manual checks. It will also be able to greatly reduce the number of interfaces managed by their IT team and most importantly Dayforce will help them build their culture.
 We are very pleased with continued performance of our sales team and the continuous strong demand we are seeing in the marketplace. I would now like to briefly highlight some of the recent industry recognitions. Constellation Research named Dayforce to the Constellation shortlist for both workforce management suite and for payroll for North America's small- and medium-sized businesses and for the second time Software Reviews rated Dayforce as the leading vendor solution in their most recent HCM category report. Dayforce was also ranked in this report for first place or likeliness to recommend. We are proud of our accompaniments, and are committed to our continued product effort.
 I will now turn it to Arthur to discuss our financial results and guidance with you in greater detail. 
Arthur Gitajn: Thank you, David, and good evening, everyone. I'm going to take a few minutes to talk about our first quarter 2019 financial results, then I'll provide guidance for the second quarter of 2019 and for the full year. The Ceridian 10-Q has been filed and is available on the SEC EDGAR website and also in Canada on the SEDAR website. Note too, beginning on Page 9 of our Form 10-Q, details recently adopted accounting policies, and I'm going to take just a few minutes to highlight some of the new standards we adopted.
 First as we've talked about on previous calls, we adopted the new revenue recognition standard, ASC 606, effective January 1 this year on a retrospective basis. All prior year figures have been adjusted as if ASC 606 had been in effect, and we've detailed on pages 10 and 11 of our Form 10-Q the impact of implementing ASC 606 on our financial statements.
 Generally, the adoption of ASC 606 had the effect of increasing professional services and other revenue and reducing recurring services revenue. And certain selling expenses such as commissions and bonuses paid to the sales force, are now being amortized over a 5-year period.
 We've also adopted the new pension presentation standard, ASU 2017-07, and as a result, pension expense is now included in the line other income expense net, which is now presented in a separate line outside of operating profit.
 And we've adopted a new restricted cash presentation standard, ASU 2016-18, and restricted cash and equivalents held to satisfy customer trust funds obligations are now included in our cash flow statement.
 Moving on to our first quarter 2019 financial results. Revenue from our flagship Cloud HCM platform Dayforce increased by $28.7 million or 27.6% to $132.8 million. On a constant currency basis, Dayforce revenue increased 28.6%. Revenue from Powerpay, our Cloud solution exclusively for the Canadian small business market, declined by $1 million or 4.4% to $21.8 million. On a constant currency basis, Powerpay revenue increased by 0.5%. Cloud revenue, which includes both Dayforce and Powerpay, increased by $27.7 million or 21.8% to $154.6 million. On a constant currency basis, Cloud revenue increased 23.7%.
 Total revenue, which includes revenue from both our Cloud and Bureau solutions, increased by $14.9 million or 7.9% to $203.7 million and on a constant currency basis, total revenue increased 9.5%.
 Our guidance for 2019 assumed a U.S. dollar to Canadian dollar exchange rate of $1.30. The Canadian dollar weakened against the U.S. dollar during the first quarter, and the actual average exchange rate was just under $1.33. The weaker Canadian dollar negatively affected revenues, including a $1 million currency headwind. Cloud revenue came in at the middle of our $154 million to $156 million guidance range; however, on a constant currency basis, Cloud revenue came in at the high end of our guidance range.
 Total revenue came in at the middle of our $203 million to $205 million guidance range; however, on a constant currency basis, total revenue came in right at the high end of our guidance range. Adjusted EBITDA exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $1.8 million primarily due to solid revenue results and lower than planned expenses.
 Cloud revenue growth in the first quarter was driven by a 24.5% increase in Cloud recurring services revenue and an 11.9% increase in Cloud professional services and other revenue. Of the $27.7 million increase in total Cloud revenue, $4.7 million or 17% was attributable to Bureau customers migrating to Dayforce. Excluding the impact of migrations to Dayforce, revenue from Bureau solutions declined by $8.1 million or 13.1% which was in line with our expectations.
 Cloud revenue accounted for 76% of our total revenue in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 67% in the first quarter of 2018. Q1 revenue from Powerpay, our Cloud HR and payroll solution for the Canadian small business market, declined 4.4% to $21.8 million. On a constant currency basis, Powerpay revenue was up about 0.5%. As we noted in the management's discussion and analysis, Powerpay revenue is recognized on a per employee, per process basis and the timing of customer processing at year-end can vary from year-to-year. A larger proportion of year-end processing occurred in the fourth quarter of 2018, and a smaller proportion of year-end processing occurred in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the prior periods. This pull-forward of revenue into Q4 2018 was driven by the fact that December 31 was a Monday, and a number of customers processed their first 2019 payroll on Monday, December 31, 2018. We estimate that approximately $1 million in Powerpay revenue that would otherwise have been recognized in the first quarter of 2019 was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2018.
 Excluding this pull-forward, Powerpay revenue on a constant currency basis would have grown by approximately 5%. The average float balance for our customer trust funds during the first quarter was approximately $4.08 billion compared to $4.07 billion in the first quarter last year. The average yield on our float balance was 2.42% during the first quarter of 2019, an increase of 67 basis points compared to the average yield in the first quarter of 2018. As a result, income from invested customer trust funds was $24.3 million in the first quarter compared to $17.6 million in the first quarter last year. The balance sheet value of customer trust funds as of March 31, 2019, was $4.6 billion compared to $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2018. The increase in the March 31, 2019, balance sheet value of customer trust funds reflects the fact that the last business day of Q1 was a Friday while the last business day of Q4 2018 was a Monday, and Friday balances are generally higher than Monday balances.
 We also continued to expand our gross margin during the first quarter. While Cloud recurring services revenue grew $24.5 million or 24.5%, our cost of Cloud recurring services to support this growth increased by only $4.1 million or 12.4% and our gross margin on Cloud recurring services increased from 66.9% in the first quarter last year to 70.1%, reflecting an increase in the proportion of Dayforce customers live for more than 2 years from 59% in the first quarter last year to 64%. And also our ability to continue to realize economies of scale in customer support and hosting costs.
 Our negative gross margin on professional services and other revenue improved from negative 0.17% in the first quarter last year to negative 14.2%, reflecting an increase in profitable post go-live professional services. We're adding implementation resources throughout the year to address increased demand. And as these new resources become more productive, we expect the margin on professional services and other revenue to continue to improve.
 As we discussed on previous earnings calls, we stepped up our investments in research and development and in sales and marketing in the second half last year, and our first quarter results reflect these initiatives. Product development and management expenses increased by $1.5 million or 10.9% to $15.2 million; sales and marketing expenses increased $6.2 million or 21% to $35.2 million; and sales and marketing expenses as a percent of revenue increased from 15.4% to 17.3%.
 G&A expenses increased $5.1 million to $31 million. On an adjusted basis, excluding share-based compensation expense, severance charges and fees primarily associated with our secondary offering in March, G&A expenses increased $2.1 million as compared to the first quarter last year primarily due to increased costs associated with being a public company.
 We realized an operating profit of $27.4 million in the first quarter compared to an operating profit of $28 million in the first quarter last year, a decline of 2% year-over-year primarily due to higher selling, general and administrative expenses. After adjusting for share-based compensation and other items excluded from adjusted EBITDA, operating profit was up 10.4 -- 10.5%. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $3.3 million or 7.1% to $49.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin declined 20 basis points from 24.6% to 24.4%. As we discussed in our last earnings call, we expected Q1 2019 adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the 22.7% to 23.4% range as we were comparing to a period prior to our IPO, which did not reflect certain public company expenses and investments in R&D and sales and marketing. Actual Q1 adjusted EBITDA margin exceeded the high end of our guidance by 100 basis points to 24.4%.
 Income from continuing operations before income taxes was $16.9 million, an increase of $8.9 million compared to $8 million in the first quarter last year, reflecting reduced interest expense from the redemption of the senior notes during the second quarter last year.
 I'm happy to report that on March 26, Moody's upgraded our senior secured credit facilities rating from B3 to B2, which will result in a 25 basis point rate reduction to our floating rate term debt interest rate, which will save us about $1.7 million on an annual basis.
 Moving to the balance sheet. As of March 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $206.3 million, a reduction of $11.5 million compared to December 31, 2018, and our total debt was $668.9 million as of March 31, 2019, a reduction of $1.4 million compared to December 31, 2018. The $11.5 million reduction in cash was primarily attributable to annual incentive plan payments and the benefits decision support acquisition.
 Our capital expenditures in Q1 2019 were $13.9 million compared to $10.3 million in Q1 2018. Included in the $13.9 million in capital expenditures were $4 million for property and equipment and $9.9 million for software and technology, of which $7.3 million was capitalized software development, an increase of $1.2 million compared to Q1 2018.
 Turning now to our outlook for the second quarter and full year fiscal 2019, I want to highlight 3 critical assumptions underlying our guidance: first, our guidance reflects the adoption of ASC 606 effective January 1 this year; second, our guidance continues to reflect a U.S. dollar to Canadian dollar exchange rate of $1.30 consistent with the exchange rate assumption used for guidance provided in previous quarters; third, our guidance also assumes no changes in the U.S. Fed funds rates or the Bank of Canada rates during 2019, so any Fed funds or Bank of Canada rate increases will be upside to our guidance.
 Now with respect to guidance for the full year fiscal 2019, we are reaffirming the full year ranges we provided on February 6, 2019, for Cloud revenue, total revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Specifically on a constant currency basis, Cloud revenue's expected to be in the range of $655 million to $660 million; total revenue is expected to be in the range of $810 million to $815 million; and adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $182 million to $187 million.
 For the second quarter of 2019, we expect Cloud revenue to be in the range of $154 million to $156 million; total revenue to be in the range of $191 million to $193 million; and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $37 million to $39 million.
 At this time, I am going to ask the operator to open the line for questions. Thank you very much. 
Operator: David Ossip, CEO of Ceridian, would like to provide a few remarks before I begin the live Q&A session. David, please proceed. 
David Ossip: Thank you, Arthur. There are 5 areas that I would like to go into a little bit more depth in terms of the acceleration of Dayforce in Q1, which I believe provide a lot of color into where the business is and where we are going. First the Dayforce growth rate accelerated from 27.4% to 28.6% between Q4 and Q1, and if you look at our fiscal year guidance you can imply that by the end of the year, we expect to be close to 30% year-over-year growth on Dayforce.
 The second item is, if you look at the Dayforce customers that we've added over the last 12 months, in 2018 in Q1 we added 674 customers in the prior 12 months and that increased to the current Q1 of 697. At the same time that we were adding more customers, we saw the revenue per customer increase as well. In Q1 of 2018, the average customer was approximately $113,000 and that increased to $121,000 in Q1 of 2019, an increase of 7%. Similarly if we look at the incremental revenue per customer, in Q1 of 2018, it was $155,000 and that increased to $158,000 in Q1 of 2019. And at the same time that we've obviously been increasing the number of customers, the revenue per customer and the acceleration of the Dayforce revenue growth rate, we've also have seen an improvement in the Cloud margin. The Cloud -- the gross profit margin on recurring increased from 68.5% to 70.5% year-over-year, and we also saw professional services increase from negative 17.6% to negative 14.6% during the same time.
 In summary, we obviously are quite happy with the results on the Dayforce side, and we're very confident on the future for the business.
 Operator, I'd like you to open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray. 
Aleksandr Zukin: So maybe first for David. Can you maybe talk about how the team in the field is responding to some of the changes made into the sales organization and maybe just any anecdotal commentary in terms kind of how you started the year from a bookings perspective? Any color there would be helpful. And then I've got a quick follow-up for Arthur. 
David Ossip: Thanks, Alex. Nice to speak with you. So the first question I think is answered by the fact that we've seen a very, very strong bookings. We saw that, as you know, in Q3 of last year, Q4 of last year and that continued into Q1 of this year. So the changes that we've made in the sales organization have led to better-than-expected results, if you like, on the sales side. Alongside that as well, we had a record kick off of new projects in both Q4 and in Q1, which is where the confidence of the increase in growth rate of Dayforce is coming from. 
Aleksandr Zukin: Perfect. And then for Arthur, can you maybe speak to some of the seasonality of the business on both kind of the top and bottom line. I think the consensus models -- or our model maybe have a little bit of a different linearity to it. But it seems like between the FX impacts in the quarter and some of the variability of the Powerpay revenue from Q1 into Q4, can you maybe just talk about some of the seasonality aspects that you -- so we can make sure our models are properly calibrated. 
Arthur Gitajn: Well, I think you hit on 2 items that were -- that I think masked and disguised a little bit the strong performance of Dayforce, both foreign exchange and Powerpay. Foreign exchange, year-over-year, the Canadian dollar is now, I think, at a low point for the last 10 years, and weakened about 5% relative to the U.S. dollar. And since we have about 30% of our revenues in Canada, Cloud revenue was generally affected and Powerpay revenue in particular. Powerpay revenue on a constant currency basis increased by 0.5%. And as I explained on the remarks that we had this shift of about $1 million of Powerpay revenue recognized in December that would have otherwise been recognized in January as a certain number of customers, about a 10% increase in the number of processes in December, as the number of customers chose to process their first week's 2019 payroll in 2018 on the Monday, December 31. So I think those 2 items really masked the underlying strong performance of Dayforce. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. 
Mark Murphy: David, just at a high level, regarding the very last point you made in your prepared comments. Is it fair to say that you're confident in the ability to onboard more customers this year than last year, and also at a higher ASP than last year. In other words, kind of leveraging both of those growth vectors to grow by a larger dollar increment? 
David Ossip: Mark, we've seen a shift in distribution to larger customers that have a higher dollar value. So we're confident that we will onboard obviously, more dollars of recurring revenue this year. I can't speak to the volume, but I expect the volume to be somewhat constant to what we've seen in prior years. There is, as you know, as we go up the market, we expect the growth rate, if you like, in that to somewhat flatten out, but the dollar amount will keep on going up and probably accelerate.
 Related to that as well is that we, as Arthur mentioned, we expect that the professional services and other margins will also continue to strengthen throughout the year. And so we obviously are becoming much more efficient at onboarding the revenue and onboarding the revenue in many cases, quicker than we have historically. 
Mark Murphy: Okay. Good. Yes. thank you for clarifying. It's good to hear that dollar amount will increase, if not accelerate. And then, Arthur, I wanted to ask just in Q1, did you realize the benefit that you expected from the record Q4 volume of Dayforce go-lives? Or did -- said differently, did anything other than currency restrict the sequential growth in the Cloud recurring revenue? 
Arthur Gitajn: No. 
David Ossip: And Mark, we were very happy with the Dayforce performance. If you look at it on a constant currency basis, it's actually gone from, in Q4 of '18, from 27.4% to 28.6% in the sequential quarters. So you see the impact of the go-live and the very strong sales [ really ] in Q3 and Q4 coming into impact. We haven't yet seen the impact really of the Q3, Q4, Q1 sales yet, and that's what gives us confidence in believing that we'll see these Dayforce growth rate end of the year close to 30%, so up from the 28.6% as well. 
Mark Murphy: Okay. Understood. One last one, Arthur. I believe you said you're still using the $1.30 on the U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar. But I believe the spot rate, if I'm looking at this correctly, is $1.34. And so I guess I just wanted to clarify, is there a reason you're not using the spot rate currently? 
Arthur Gitajn: Yes. I mean we had a lot of discussion about this. So just to be clear, we used $1.30 last year. It turns out $1.30 was the actual exchange rate in 2018. It was the actual exchange rate in 2017. It was the average exchange rate for the last 4 years. At the time we were preparing guidance for the year, we were $1.31 so we decided that we'd stick with the $1.30. We don't want to be in a position where we're raising and lowering guidance every quarter based on currency fluctuations. But the Canadian dollar, which is at the weakest point it's been now, I think in the last 10 years, we'll have to look at it. If the U.S. dollar continues to be as strong as it has, we may revisit this in the next quarter. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Justin Furby with William Blair and Company. 
Justin Furby: David, if you look at the Dayforce recurring revenue and you strip out the services, it looks like that's closer to mid-30s growth, net of currency. And I guess, you're talking to an acceleration or slight acceleration in Dayforce throughout the course of the year. Is that driven on recurring, or is some of that some of the services work that you expect to deliver? Just sort of what drives that between the 2 lines? And then I've got a quick follow-up. 
David Ossip: So in general, it's been driven by both. Arthur can provide the kind of comments as to the breakdown of the 2. 
Arthur Gitajn: Yes. So we had tremendous growth last year in Dayforce professional services and other, and we've had continued growth this year but the incremental additional growth this year is less. The actual recurring -- Dayforce recurring revenue on a constant currency basis increased $26.3 million to $103.1 million, and this compares to an increase of $25.9 million in Q1 last year. So not only is it increasing but the increases are increasing. 
Justin Furby: Okay. Maybe said another way, I guess your services growth is sort of the low teens in the Cloud and your Cloud recurring was mid-20s. Is that sort of the right way to think about sort of the rest of the year. Or is there something that you think changes in that dynamic as we move throughout the year. 
David Ossip: The -- more of the growth is going to come from the recurring side this year versus on the professional services and other because we had the very rapid growth, if you like, in professional services and other last year. Whereas this year, it will be somewhat more constant. Currently I believe in the business, about 70% of the Dayforce revenue currently is on the recurring side and about 30% on the professional services. So you'll see more dollars come in from the growth of the Dayforce Live from the recurring side both because of the 70% versus the 30% and also because you've got a higher growth rate on the recurring and due on the professional services. 
Justin Furby: Okay. That's helpful. And then just on Powerpay. Can you give a sense for what you're expecting. I know there's some pull forward, but throughout the balance of this year like should we still be thinking about it as sort of a mid-single-digit grower? Or what's embedded in your guidance there? 
David Ossip: Yes, that's correct. Let me just repeat what Arthur said. Powerpay, we recognize revenue when the client processes pay. This year, December 31 fell on a Monday and so approximately about 10% of the Powerpay customers elected to process their first pay for 2019 on that Monday, and so that $1 million of revenue was recognized in 2018 versus 2019.
 If you adjusted the revenue for that, you would have landed up at about a 5% growth rate in constant currency. We would expect that to be somewhat within the range for the remainder of the year. We believe it will be in the mid-single digits for the remainder of the year. Now towards the end of this year, we do have some new features that are going to come online for the Powerpay business, which should provide an up-sell capability. So we do still believe that we can bring the business into the low double digits but it requires the new products to come on stream in the second half of the year. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Mark Marcon with RW Baird. 
Mark Marcon: I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the pipeline that you're seeing with regards to new opportunities, both domestically and internationally, particularly in light of some of the customer events that you've had and some of the recent wins, just how much is the buzz spreading? How's that pipeline look? 
David Ossip: So Mark, we -- the pipeline remains very healthy. As we said, we believe very -- and we see very strong demand for our product. This year, in terms of summits, we had one in Miami, we had a partner event in Fort Lauderdale, a customer event in L.A., a customer event in Sydney, Australia. In May, we have one in the U.K. We have a larger one in June in New York, followed by Chicago in August, and that will be followed by INSIGHTS in October. We're seeing very healthy attendance at the events.
 You also see the evidence of the pipeline in the sales results. And as I mentioned, where we saw very strong sales results in 2018, we continue to see very strong sales results in Q1. Not only are we seeing stronger results, but we're also seeing evidence of more successes upmarket, consistent of what we communicated last year about our focus on strategic accounts and we're confident that will continue for the remainder of the year. 
Mark Marcon: Great. And then can you talk a little bit about how we should think about the professional gross margins as we unfold through the year. You've obviously had a number of wins, and you've had to ramp up the implementation capabilities. So how do we think about this from a -- what's embedded in the guidance in terms of the professional margins for this year, and then as we think about longer term relative to some of the things that you've mentioned previously? 
David Ossip: Yes. Also still very consistent what we communicated before. We saw strengthening of professional services and other gross margin Q1 to Q1 of negative 17.6% to negative 14.2%. What I would point out is that we did increase head count. I think Arthur made mention of that, in the implementation of professional services fees. So the improvement of the 340 basis points actually includes additional head count that we have in there. So we've seen increased productivity of that group.
 We would expect that negative 14.2% to strengthen throughout the year, and we'll probably end the year in probably kind of a low single-digit negative margin with the objective obviously of getting to breakeven as we've communicated previously in future years. 
Mark Marcon: And how should we think about the impact from some of the international expansion? Whether it's -- we've had the U.K., Australia. As that ramps, how do we think about the impact? When we're looking at the margin performance, should we think of those as being drags that obviously will be profitable in the long term, but how do we think about this kind of the domestic profitability relative to those newer initiatives? 
David Ossip: You aren't going to see a negative impact of the global side. In fact, within Q1 and Q2 of this year, we've got a number of customers that have gone live with the U.K. product. In Australia, we're using a partner model for implementation, so you actually get higher margins because it's offloaded onto the partners if you like. We take responsibility for that. We also have domestic teams in both the U.K. and in Australia who are able to do local implementations. And those teams are augmented by the resources that we have in the Mauritius, which obviously have a lower cost base than we have in North America. So we don't believe that the global expansion will impact the professional services and other margins. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Turrin with Deutsche Bank. 
Michael Turrin: On the Dayforce go-lives, you added 133 customers during the quarter, which is a solid number but maybe a touch lower than what we saw in Q1 of last year. You obviously referenced the trailing 12-month number's up nicely. Can you just remind us around some of the seasonality inside that number. And I'm also wondering if some of the strength we saw in Q4 there had any impact at all in the Q1 number. 
David Ossip: Yes. Michael, that's a great question. And if you recall in the last earnings call, I kind of explained that you really have 2 large go-live seasons. You have basically January and you have July. And so when we look at it from a trailing perspective, you really should be thinking more from a perspective of the Q4, Q1. So Q4 of last year, we had 253 accounts that went live. And in this year [ over here ] you've got 133. So if you add those 2 numbers together, you are at about 386 customers that went live during that period. And you compare that to Q4 of '17 and Q1 of '18, you had a 146 and 153 go-lives, so a smaller number.
 We would expect to see a -- the next big increase in go lives will probably be between the Q2, Q3 piece. And again, it's somewhat dependent by day of week. So the fact that you have that Monday being -- 12/31 being a Monday of the year, the customers that would have gone live in the first week of January ended up going live on that Monday, which was that 12/31. And so the day of the week piece unfortunately creates a little bit of movement both in the float side, the Powerpay processing side, but also on the go-live.
 And you'll see that as well as we go into the Q2, Q3 period for go-lives, depending on where that day of the week ends could have impacted some of the numbers. So I would encourage you rather to look at a longer term; last 12 months is probably a good number because it evens out the days of the week. 
Michael Turrin: That's helpful, David. I appreciate the color there. And then maybe one for Arthur. The Q1 EBITDA number came in above the high end and despite some of these FX headwinds, of where you were guiding. But it looks like the Q2 numbers is below -- a touch below where we were modeling. So just wondering if you saw and expenses that may have shifted from Q1 into Q2 and/or if there might be any FX-related impacts to that number to call out as well. 
Arthur Gitajn: No. In Q2, we're lapping a quarter before we accelerated investments in sales and marketing and research and development in the second half of the year. That's where it accounts for the quarterly decline. But again on a full year basis, we're -- our full year guidance, which we're reaffirming, is for EBITDA to increase. And again, we're -- even as we're investing in R&D and sales and marketing to continue to grow the business, we expect full year adjusted EBITDA to increase by $21 million to $26 million and adjusted EBITDA margin to expand 80 to 120 basis points to 22.5% to 22.9%. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Crédit Suisse. 
Brad Zelnick: David, now with the market digesting the take-private of Ultimate Software and financial results they just released a couple hours ago showing deceleration, what's changing from a competitive perspective? And are win rates changing against them in any perceptible way? 
David Ossip: As I've said before, we've seen very strong successes in sales over the last number of quarters, if not longer, and we're still seeing very strong demand. We've seen a move upmarket. I can't speak directly to what's going on within Ultimate, but I would imagine some of our success may have come from there. But as far as we're seeing, we're still seeing a very, very healthy market. And as I pointed out, we've seen an acceleration in the Dayforce growth rates and we've seen an acceleration at scale. 
Brad Zelnick: Great. And if I could just ask one follow-up. With the average revenue per customer ticking up very nicely this quarter consistent with the success you're seeing with increasingly large customers, can you give us a sense of how much of this is driven by increasing customer size versus broader module adoption? And which models are experiencing the most momentum? 
David Ossip: Sure. It's a combination of both. We definitely are seeing an increase in average size, and we are seeing many more wins in the what we call strategic market, which is above the 6,000 piece. In terms of ACV, or in terms of revenue, as we've mentioned before, it's approximately 20% of the revenue growth actually comes from the add-ons, so the additional modules and as well professional services to the existing base. Where we see high attachment rates or higher uptick would be where you would expect recruiting, performance management, learning management, document management, et cetera. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. 
Raimo Lenschow: Can you talk -- as you kind of expand internationally, can you talk a little bit about -- you mentioned Ireland as the next area where you can go in, et cetera. Can you talk a little bit about what drives to go deeper into a certain country like invest more versus going into a new country. Like what's your thinking process there. 
David Ossip: Sure. Hey, Raimo. So really the next 2 countries are Ireland and New Zealand, and really we think about it as completing a region. So if we think about the U.S. say kind of U.S. and Canada, if you think about the U.K., it's the U.K. and Ireland. If you think about Australia, you talk about ANZ. And so in order to increase the success rate in the U.K. market and Australian market, it makes a lot of sense and low-hanging fruit to add those 2 adjacent marketplaces.
 As we go beyond that, we basically look to where we have clusters of success of customers. So although we haven't made a decision, potential countries to expand to would include Germany, where we've had tremendous success on the workforce management side. It could be countries like South Africa as I mentioned. We signed another very large customer in Southern Africa. And then obviously, there could be the expansion possibilities into Asia. 
Raimo Lenschow: And Arthur, one quick question, follow-up if I may. Can you talk a little bit about the capitalization of R&D that kind of -- what's driving -- what's getting capitalized versus what's getting expensed? What's your policy there? 
Arthur Gitajn: Sure. We actually include this in the Q. But it's ASC 350 requires us to capitalize costs associated with software developed for internal use. And because we're a true cloud company that offers our software on a subscription basis, all of our software development is for internal use. So when the project reaches the application development phase, it's a point between the when we've got the preliminary project stage completed, we've got funding authorized and the projects deemed to be probable, we will capitalize software. Then the expenses that we incur before that point and the expenses we incur after that point are both reflected in cost of revenue under a product development expense. And I can break out those numbers for you. The capitalized software development was $7.3 million in Q1 compared to $6.1 million in Q1 '18. The R&D portion, pure research and development that occurs before that stage, was $7.8 million this quarter -- this first quarter compared to $6.4 million in Q1 last year. And then the product management expense, which is after the products are completed, was $7.4 million this year compared to $7.3 million last year, essentially flat. 
David Ossip: Raimo, internally and when we actually speak, we actually talk about R&D investment as a combination of them both. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies. 
Samad Samana: I wanted to ask a little bit more about sales investments. I'm curious, as you think about the priorities for the rest of 2019, is it more focused on hiring sales reps in North America versus international? And then generally, in terms of hiring sales reps versus the summits and branding events that increase Ceridian's brand presence in the market. 
David Ossip: So that's actually quite a good question. If we actually look at our sales and marketing expense, it's actually declined from Q4 to Q1. It went from 18.4% to 17.3%. However, the 17.3% is up about 1.9% from Q1 of last year. In terms of global versus North America, the fact that we've got a larger presence in North America means the numbers are going to be skewed to North America versus global. But if you look at the percentage of increase in those domestic markets, in the U.K. and Australia, we obviously are investing quite significantly year-over-year in those particular markets. In terms of marketing spend, which includes the summits, it's up slightly but still is quite modest relative to the others inside the market. 
Samad Samana: Great. And then maybe one for Arthur. When we think about the Bureau churn and the capture rate for Dayforce, I know the company has given its expectations last quarter for this year. But I'm curious if there's any updated view on the percentage you expect to capture. And then maybe just the profile of the customers that are left in the Bureau business that you think you'll gather in terms of size. Are those more in midmarket? Are those slightly on the largest side? Just curious. 
Arthur Gitajn: The guidance we provided is that we expect about 13% to 17% of our Cloud revenue to come from migrations from Bureau and that's -- and we saw that this quarter, of the $27.7 million increase in Cloud revenue, about 17%, $4.7 million of the increase came from Bureau customers.
 While we're talking about Bureau, we tend to isolate Bureau and Cloud and talk about Powerpay and so forth, but if you look at the whole, the whole business continues to perform very well. If you look at the incremental additional revenue of $14.9 million is increasing 3x more than the cost of revenue. So even as we're adding implementation resources and stepping up our investments in R&D, the gross margin on the incremental revenue for the whole business was 72% in the first quarter. And we now have the happy problem of having to calculate diluted earnings per share as our net income has increased from $600,000 in Q1 last year to $11.2 million. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Chris Merwin with Goldman Sachs. 
Christopher Merwin: So just to follow up on a question earlier on revenue per customer. Can you tell us what is assumed in your full year revenue guidance for growth in employee per customer? You've contemplated any meaningful increase there or is further success with what you're seeing as strategic accounts really just incremental to what you've guided to. And then maybe a second question for David, on On-Demand Pay. I know that was rolled out relatively recently, so just curious what the feedback has been from customers so far and maybe how we should be thinking about tailwinds to [happen] from that product. 
David Ossip: Sure. So for the first, we don't provide guidance in average revenue customer. And from a forecasting perspective, we actually build up a forecast from -- an account by account basis. So we look at the work in process, and we have the expected go-live days of each of the accounts, and we know when they go live, we get access to the recurring revenue and obviously, the implementation of professional services revenue is recognized over the life of that. So that's how we basically forecast out the numbers. But you've seen a consistent trend over the last 5 quarters that we've reported. So if I look at the total revenue per customer in Q1 of -- in fact, I'll go back to '17. Q1 of '17, you had $101.5 thousand per customer, that increased to $102.8 thousand in Q2 to $105.3 thousand in Q3 to $108.3 thousand in Q4. That increased to $113 thousand in Q1 to $116.6 thousand in Q2 to $118.9 thousand in Q3 to $117.6 thousand in Q4 to $121.3 thousand in Q1 of 2019.
 So you've seen the kind of increased consistently now for the last 9 quarters that we reported out. In terms of On-Demand Pay, again, when I think about On-Demand Pay, I talk about it as a longer-term growth factor for the business. In terms of the growth for the business, again 2019 is largely driven by more success in what we call the major markets, which goes up to 6,000 employees, which is effectively winning more customers, going back to those customers and selling the add-on revenue. In the latter half of this year, although we're already begin to see some of it now, more success rate in the strategic market, which starts at 6,000, which is effectively being more successful in winning accounts in the 4 verticals that we currently play.
 As we go into next year, you will see more impact of the strategic accounts into 2020. And towards probably the middle of the latter half of the year, we should start to see some impact on the global successes. And then as we go into 2021, you will begin to see some of the impact from the On-Demand side as well as you'll see more impact from the global and strategic side. So I think about it really as a separate growth curves. And the importance of all of them is to sustain the growth rate of Dayforce. And again if I look at 2019, we'll begin to see that in the acceleration of the Dayforce growth rate. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Wells with Citi. 
Matthew Wells: This one's for David. When you're adding implementation head count, I believe you and Arthur flagged it earlier on the call. Is that a function of complexity that you're seeing in your current large deals? Or are you just seeing more pipeline activity overall? 
David Ossip: So thanks for the question. So between 2017 and 2018, we actually reduced head count in the professional -- implementation professional services and other. We're now adding head count just basically to meet the sales success that we've had over the last number of quarters. As I mentioned, we had record project kickoffs in Q4 and again in Q1. And so obviously, it's a requirement just to handle the project volume and the business. 
Matthew Wells: And I have a quick follow-up for Arthur. I'm just doing the math here and it looks like FX was about a 2% incremental headwind to Cloud since you issued original guidance for Q1 and that comes out to be about $1.2 million. I just want to make sure I'm thinking about that correctly. 
Arthur Gitajn: Yes. 
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to David for closing remarks. 
David Ossip: Great. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Again, we're very pleased with the results in the Dayforce business, and we're very confident in the future of the Dayforce business. I look forward to speaking with you all, I think in the one-on-ones. And for those of the investors will be joining us at the JP conference in a few weeks, I look forward to seeing everyone. Thank you very much. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-06 17:00:00) =====

As a reminder, all figures discussed on this conference call are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.
 With that, I will turn the call over to David. 
David Ossip: Thanks, Jeremy. Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter year-end earnings call. We are pleased with the results from the fourth quarter of 2018. During the fourth quarter, Dayforce revenue grew by 34% year-over-year and Cloud revenue grew by 28%. On a constant currency basis, Dayforce revenue grew 36% year-over-year and Cloud revenue grew 30%. The fourth quarter was a record-setting quarter, both in terms of Dayforce recurring revenue taken live and the number of customers added. We ended the year with 3,718 customers live on the Dayforce platform, a net increase of 253 customers from the third quarter of 2018 and an increase of 717 customers since December 31, 2017.
 Q4 adjusted EBITDA increased 22% year-over-year. We achieved a 220 basis point improvement in our adjusted EBITDA margin to 21.7% of revenue. And income from continuing operations before income taxes was $12.7 million in the fourth quarter.
 For the full year 2018, Dayforce revenue grew 38% and Cloud revenue grew 32%. And total revenue grew 11% year-over-year. Gross margin on Cloud recurring services increased from 63% to 68%, and gross margin on professional services and other improved from negative 88% to negative 41% year-over-year.
 Total revenue increased by $76 million, and we converted over 30% of that revenue growth or $39 million into adjusted EBITDA. And adjusted EBITDA margin improved nearly 350 basis points to 21% for the full year 2018.
 We continued our investment in product development during 2018. Our cash investment in product development, including research and development expense and capitalized software development, was $55 million, up 22% year-over-year to 7.4% of revenue.
 In 2018, we launched compensation management, learning management and succession planning. We also announced near-term Dayforce platform features, including advanced analytics, benefits decision support, engagement surveys, compensation data [ benchmarking ] and On-Demand Pay. We believe these product enhancements will broaden our HCM functionality and will enable us to sell additional functionality to new and existing customers.
 In 2018, approximately 20% of our sale were add-on features to our existing customers. We expect the cadence of product announcements and launches in 2019 to be similar to that of 2018.
 Globally, we also launched native U.K. payroll in 2018 and already have customers live in the U.K. In 2019, we are launching native Australian payroll and intend to expand our native payroll functionality into New Zealand and Ireland. In addition, we intend to expand the countries covered by Dayforce connected pay solution. 
 We also invested an additional $15 million in sales and marketing during 2018 compared to 2017. These investments contributed some strong sales throughout 2018, and in Q4, we saw strong demand from larger customers.
 In our financial services vertical, we closed the financial service leader with more than 22,000 U.S. employees. In the retail and hospitality verticals, we closed a 20,000 employee retail, a restaurant chain with more than 8,000 employees and a hotel chain with more than 11,000 employees. In the manufacturing vertical, we signed a major producer of electronic and fiber optic connectors and coax cable who has approximately 15,000 employees. And in the health care and human services segment, we signed a nursing and professional services health care company with approximately 9,000 professionals.
 In summary, Q4 2018 was a record sales quarter and 2018 was a record sales year. We are very pleased with the performance of our sales team and the continued strong demand we are seeing in the marketplace.
 I would now like to briefly highlight some recent industry recognitions. In 2018, we received a record number of awards for our products, services and employee engagement. I'm especially pleased with engagement awards, including Glassdoor Employees' Choice Awards for 2018 best places to work in both the U.S. and Canada, best places certification in both the U.S. and Canada and our presence on list for best workplaces for inclusion, for millennials, for women and for technology. We believe that our great culture leads to great customer experiences. We are an example of how using Dayforce at Ceridian has created a culture of innovation and performance.
 I will now turn it over to Arthur to discuss our financial results and guidance with you in greater detail. 
Arthur Gitajn: Thank you, David, and good evening, everyone. I'm going to take a few minutes to talk about our fourth quarter 2018 financial results, then I'm going to provide some highlights on our full year 2018 financial results, and finally, I'll provide guidance for 2019.
 Starting with our fourth quarter 2018 financial results. Dayforce revenue increased by $31.3 million or 34% to $122.6 million. Cloud revenue, which includes both Dayforce and Powerpay, increased by $32 million or 28% to $148.3 million. And total revenue, which includes revenue from both our Cloud and Bureau solutions, increased by $17.9 million or 10% to $200.3 million. On a constant currency basis, Dayforce revenue grew by 36%, Cloud revenue grew by 30%, and total revenue grew 11%.
 Cloud revenue growth in the fourth quarter was driven by a 26% increase in Cloud recurring services revenue and a 34% increase in Cloud professional services and other revenue. Of the $32 million increase in total Cloud revenue, $5.1 million or 16% was attributable to Bureau customers migrating to Dayforce. Excluding the impact of migrations to Dayforce, revenue from Bureau solutions declined by $9 million or 13.6%, which was in line with our expectations. Cloud revenue accounted for 74% of our total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 64% in the fourth quarter of 2017.
 Q4 revenue from Powerpay, our cloud HR and payroll solution for the Canadian small business market, increased 3% to $25.7 million. On a constant currency basis, excluding the impact of the year-over-year decline in the Canadian dollar, Powerpay revenue increased by 7%.
 The average float balance for our customer trust funds during the fourth quarter was approximately $3.08 billion compared to $2.99 billion in the fourth quarter last year. The average yield on our float balance was 2.26% during the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of 62 basis points compared to the average yield in the fourth quarter of 2017. As a result, income from invested customer trust funds was $17.4 million in the fourth quarter compared to $12.3 million in the fourth quarter last year. The balance sheet value of customer trust funds as of December 31, 2018, was $2.6 billion compared to $4.1 billion as of December 31, 2017. The decline in the end-of-year balance sheet value of customer trust funds reflects the fact that the last business day of 2017 was a Friday, while the last business day of 2018 was a Monday, and Friday balances are higher than Monday balances.
 We also continued to expand our gross margins and operating margins during the fourth quarter. While Cloud recurring services revenue grew $24.8 million or 26%, our cost of Cloud recurring services to support this growth increased by only $3.9 million or 11%, and our gross margin on Cloud recurring services increased from 64% in the fourth quarter last year to 68%, reflecting an increase in the proportion of Dayforce customers live for more than 2 years from 59% in the fourth quarter last year to 63% and also our ability to continue to realize economies of scale in customer support and hosting costs.
 While professional services and other revenue grew $6.5 million or 29%, professional services and other costs increased by only $0.5 million or less than 2%. And our negative gross margin on professional services and other improved from negative 49% in the fourth quarter last year to negative 17%, reflecting an increase in profitable post go-live professional services and productivity improvements in implementing new customers.
 As we discussed on our second and third quarter earnings calls, we stepped up our investments in research and development and in sales and marketing in the second half last year, and our fourth quarter results reflect these initiatives. Product development and management expenses increased by $3.9 million or 33% to $15.7 million. Sales and marketing expenses increased $4.6 million or 13% to $39.6 million, and sales and marketing expenses as a percent of revenue increased from 19.2% to 19.8%.  G&A expenses increased $3.8 million to $30.8 million primarily due to costs associated with the secondary offering in November, increased share-based compensation and increased costs associated with being a public company.
 We realized an operating profit of $21.5 million in the fourth quarter compared to operating profit of $16.1 million in the fourth quarter last year, up 34% year-over-year. And income from continuing operations before income taxes was $12.7 million, an improvement of $18.4 million compared to a loss of $5.7 million in the fourth quarter last year.
 Adjusted EBITDA increased by $7.9 million or 22% to $43.5 million, and adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 220 basis points to 21.7%.
 Turning now to our full year 2018 financial results. Dayforce revenue increased by $123.1 million or more than 38% to $443 million. Cloud revenue, which includes both Dayforce and Powerpay, increased by $130 million or 32% to $534.3 million. And total revenue, which includes revenue from both our Cloud and Bureau solutions, increased by $75.6 million or 11% to $746.4 million. Foreign currency rates had an immaterial impact on our full year revenue growth as the Canadian dollar was relatively flat year-over-year on an annual basis.
 During our last call, we provided guidance for full year 2018, and I'm pleased to report that our actual results for total revenue exceeded the high end of the range by $3.4 million. And primarily due to the revenue overachievement, our actual results for adjusted EBITDA exceeded the high end of the range by $4.1 million.
 Cloud annualized recurring revenue, which includes the full year impact of customers who went live during 2018, was $506.2 million at the end of 2018, up $115.2 million or 29.5% from 2017. Annual Cloud revenue retention was 96.3% compared to 97.0% in 2017 and 95.7% in 2016. And Bureau revenue retention was 86.9% compared to 89.7% in 2017 and 87.4% in 2016.
 We continued to expand margins during 2018. Our gross margin on Cloud recurring services increased from 63% in 2017 to 68%. And our gross margin on professional services and other improved from negative 88% in 2017 to negative 41% in 2018.
 Adjusted EBITDA increased by $39.3 million or 33% to $157.1 million. And adjusted EBITDA margin expanded nearly 350 basis points to 21.0% in 2018.
 Moving to the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $217.8 million, an increase of $123.6 million compared to December 31, 2017. And our total debt was $670.3 million as of December 31, 2018, a reduction of $449.5 million compared to December 31, 2017. The $123.6 million increase in cash and the $449.5 million reduction in debt were primarily attributable to proceeds from our successful IPO and refinancing of our term debt.
 Negative free cash flow in the first half of the year of $52.9 million, which was primarily attributable to IPO-related items and higher first half interest expense, was partially offset by positive free cash flow of $9.4 million in the third quarter and positive free cash flow of $14 million in the fourth quarter.
 Our capital expenditures in 2018 were $43.4 million compared to $50.6 million in 2017. Included in the $43.4 million in capital expenditures were $32.2 million for software and technology and $11.2 million for property and equipment.
 Turning now to our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2019. I want to highlight 3 critical assumptions underlying our guidance. First, our guidance reflects the adoption of ASC 606 effective January 1 this year. As we've noted on previous calls, the adoption of ASC 606 has the effect of increasing professional services and other revenue, and reducing recurring services revenue, and certain selling expenses such as commissions and bonuses paid to the sales force will be amortized over a 5-year period. To facilitate comparisons with prior years, we provided pro forma results for each quarter in 2017 and 2018 as if the new standard had been in effect.
 Second, our guidance reflects the Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate of $1.30.
 Third, our guidance also assumes no changes in the U.S. Fed funds rate or the Bank of Canada rates during 2019, so any Fed funds or Bank of Canada increases during the year will be upside to our guidance. For reference, based on current investment practices, an increase in market investment rates of 100 basis points would increase float revenue by approximately $17 million over the 12 months following a rate increase.
 Now with respect to guidance for the full year fiscal 2019, we expect Cloud revenue to be in the range of $655 million to $660 million, total revenue to be in the range of $810 million to $815 million and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $182 million to $187 million. For those of you modeling EPS, we're looking at net interest expense of approximately $40 million for the year or approximately $10 million per quarter, income tax expense of approximately $30 million for the year, and diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately $148 million for the year.
 For the first quarter of 2019, we expect Cloud revenue to be in the range of $154 million to $156 million, total revenue to be in the range of $203 million to $205 million and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $46 million to $48 million. Q1 2019 adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be between 22.7% and 23.4% of revenue compared to 24.6% in Q1 of 2018 as restated under ASC 606. On a full year basis, we expect to continue to expand our adjusted EBITDA margin by 80 to 130 basis points. However, our current guidance for Q1 adjusted EBITDA margin is slightly lower compared to the first quarter last year before our IPO, which did not reflect certain public company expenses and investments in R&D and sales and marketing.
 At this time, I'm going to ask the operator to open up the lines for questions. Thank you. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first line -- your first question comes from the line of Mark Murphy from JPMorgan. 
Mark Murphy: So David, I believe you mentioned Q4 booking strength with larger -- the larger customer segment. I'm curious to what extent do you attribute that to growing interest in continuous payroll versus any other factors that might have been driving it. And are most of those new logos heavy on the hourly employees? 
David Ossip: So thanks, Martin. Nice speaking with you. The first point I would make is that our messaging around the continuous calculation, which, as you know, leads to better compliance calculations as well as more efficient payroll benefits and other HCM processes efficiencies resonate even better with the larger account than it does with the mid-market account because in that particular size of company, anytime you have an exception, there are thousands of the same exception. In terms of the wins that I spoke about in the press release, we did a financial services organization with more than 20,000 employees. That, I believe, has a very high mix of salaried employees, so that is not a focus on hourly. We also announced a large health care organization. Again, there's a nice mix over there between salaried. They do have some hourly. And then I did speak about the multiple wins that we had in retail and hospitality, a 20,000-plus retailer. By the way, that retailer will probably have 3,000, 4,000 salaried employees. We spoke about a fast food chain, and we also spoke about a large hotel chain. And obviously, there will be a higher mix of hourly with that. And we also spoke about a large manufacturer, which obviously would be an hourly. But in summary, you've got quite a nice mix between some customers -- some large customers with salary and some customers who have a blend. 
Mark Murphy: Okay. Just as a quick follow-up, do you plan to make more incremental investments this year on the talent management side? Or do you think it's more critical to focus on that core payroll engine and launching data payroll in additional countries in terms of just where you see better strategic value, better ability to monetize? 
David Ossip: So Mark, if you look at the product announcements that we've made in the latter half of 2018, you'll see there's actually quite a good blend between the focus on additional talent functionalities. So for example, if I go into 2019, we'll be launching engagement surveys, which is obviously talent. Even when we look at some of the compliance modules like benefits, we're now talking about benefit decision support. When we -- at the end of last year, we released succession planning, which is also on the talent side. So our belief, really, is that by focusing on the user experience as opposed to the module, you typically end up with quite a differentiated product. And obviously, we're leveraging that continuous calculation, which, quite honestly, applies even between the talent modules like compensation and payroll and applies very well when you look at recruiting, bringing in some of the compliance pieces into there as well, which we believe gives us a nice advantage. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin from Piper Jaffray. 
Aleksandr Zukin: One maybe for David and then a quick follow-up for Arthur. So David, now that Leagh has been in the seat for about 6 months, how should we think about her biggest priorities for '19? And can you give us an update around maybe what kind of success you're seeing in attracting enterprise, incremental enterprise sales talent, how that org is ramping? And where do you expect it to be a year from now? 
David Ossip: Great. So Leagh has been with us for about 5 months now, and we're delighted with the impact that she's had on the organization just in the latter half of the year. As I pointed out, Q4 was a record sales quarter for us, and we saw substantial wins in what we would term strategic market. Also, inside Leagh's domain are the professional services and other as well as all of the other aspects of go to market. A lot of the priorities that Leagh and her group have been focusing on are, if you like, leveling up our go-to-market strategies, particularly in the upper end of the market by taking much more of a verticalized approach to the industries that we've seen a lot of success in. 
Aleksandr Zukin: Perfect. And then maybe just a quick follow-up for Arthur. Looking at the Cloud ARR number. I think you grew 30% year-over-year in 2018, a slight deceleration from 35% the year before. I know you're not explicitly guiding to ARR. But how should we think about the sustainability of this growth cadence into next year, particularly given the leveling up of the sales organization? And are there any other elements like FX or things that we should think about when we look at that for next year? 
Arthur Gitajn: Well, I would guide you to look at the absolute dollar increases. The absolute dollar increase in 2017 was $101 million. The absolute dollar increase in 2018 was $115 million. I think you can kind of trend it that way. In a number of areas now we've been growing so fast. The denominator has gotten so big. It's hard to move the needle. But if you look at the actual dollar increases, not only are we continuing the increase but the increases are getting larger. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin from Deutsche Bank. 
Michael Turrin: Dayforce Live customers saw a big increase. I'm just wondering, is there anything onetime or unique there? And are you geared now to handle a bigger throughput of customers as might be needed? 
David Ossip: So Mike, let me take that. There are a few things I would like to kind of emphasize over here. The first is that we saw tremendous efficiencies in our implementation teams last year. In fact, the headcount that we had in implementation, I believe, was down year-over-year, even though we saw a tremendous increase in the number of accounts that we took live. In comparison in Q4 '17, we took live 146 customers. Q4 of '18, that increased to 253 customers that were taken live. The other area that I'll probably point you to is that we've seen an increase in the average revenue per client between 2017 and 2018. In 2017, the average revenue was $107,000 per customer, and that increased to $119,000 per customer in 2018. And if we actually look at it from an incremental revenue add per client, you will see that the number in 2017 was about $153,000 per customer, and that increased in 2018 to $172,000 per customer. So the incremental revenue added per new client went up by about 13% between those 2 years. And so we're very pleased with the increase that we're seeing in ability to onboard and activate the customers as well as the increased revenue that we're actually getting per client. What drove that? Is that an anomaly? No, we don't believe that is an anomaly. We had guided and we had spoken about that we had expected Q4 to be a record quarter for us in terms of activations. I'd also like to actually add one other to each -- one other. We are, this year in 2019, increasing the number of professional services resources. So unlike in 2018 where we actually decreased the headcount and the expenses, we do expect our headcount to go up slightly in professional services and other in 2019 to handle the activation and professional services demand requirements. 
Michael Turrin: That's great color there. One quick follow-on. I'm sure we're all wondering. Does the recent go private acquisition of one of your direct competitors in any way change the way you're thinking about your 2019 plans and priorities? 
David Ossip: The short answer is no. We don't believe it'll have a short-term impact into the marketplace. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. 
Raimo Lenschow: David, can you talk -- you gave the customer examples you talked about. The size of the customers seems to get bigger. Can you talk a little bit about that -- your thinking about like your evolution in terms of kind of which customers you are dealing with? And is that kind of -- is it you that's getting pulled up? Or is that kind of part of a plan? Can you talk through that, please? 
David Ossip: Sure, Raimo. So the increase in revenue per client is largely driven by increased module density and services. As we look towards 2019, we believe it'll also be driven by increased size as we move much more into the strategic market. Moving to the strategic market is twofold. First, we have been opportunistic where we have been brought into the larger accounts based on the success, if you like, of the continuous calculation messaging in a single database. The second part, with Leagh joining the organization, we're taking a much more disciplined approach in how we target strategic accounts in terms of taking more of a value-added sales approach to specific verticals where we can tailor the message and the benefits of the technology. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon from R.W. Baird. 
Mark Marcon: Wondering if you can talk a little bit about who you were  -- --  you're winning on some of these larger clients from. Are you seeing a change with regards to the RFP pipeline in terms of who the incumbents are? The features, obviously, the continuous calc and the module robustness, is impressive. But just wondering what are some of the key drivers, both in terms of what causes you to get invited in, who you're seeing and what's -- and the key driver for winning. 
David Ossip: Thanks, Mark. Nice to be speaking to you as well. The first point I'll make is that we've seen an increase in our Net Promoter Scores year-over-year. And that increase has been most pronounced in the strategic accounts sector, which means that our referenceability and customer satisfaction in the large market has obviously influenced where we are brought into deals. The second piece is, as you know, we have been investing in partnerships in developing relationships with advisory firms and  SI firms. Just as an FYI, we had our partnership conference scheduled for early April this year, and we expect to see quite good attendance over there. Those partnerships have led to obviously higher pipeline and then obviously, influencing the actual deals as well. 
Mark Marcon: And can you talk about who you're going up against and if there's any big change? 
David Ossip: The competitive nature hasn't changed at all. We obviously do replacements of some of the other payroll companies. We also see replacements of the ERPs. It hasn't -- we also still see quite a bit of replacement of really old legacy technologies. So we haven't seen any market changes in that regard. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick from Crédit Suisse. 
Brad Zelnick: [ Numbers ] in the first half and throughout the remainder of the year? 
David Ossip: I'm sorry, Brad. I didn't catch most of the question. Could you repeat it? 
Brad Zelnick: I'm sorry. Can you hear me now? 
David Ossip: Yes, we can. Thank you. 
Brad Zelnick: Excellent, yes. So especially coming off of a record number of wins in Q4, based on the current pipeline that you have, how should we think about the cadence of go-lives into the first half and throughout the year in 2019? 
David Ossip: Brad, I don't think we give guidance into the actual count. And as you know, there is quite a lot of fluctuation between quarters in terms of the number of accounts we take live. We are scheduled to go live but based obviously on when the client is actually signed but also based on the availability of the customer team. We do not have a backlog in terms of implementation, which means we can typically kick off the projects as quickly as the customers are able to. But as I said, Q4 was a record sales quarter, and I spoke previously in prior earning calls that we have seen very strong demand throughout the entire of 2018. And our goal would be to obviously take those accounts live in 2019. 
Brad Zelnick: That's helpful. And just a quick follow-up. Your Cloud retention rates are best in class. But if we look at year-on-year, there's a slight downtick. Can you maybe speak to what explains for that and specifically, what Dayforce retention was? 
David Ossip: Sure. So if I look at reduction in a longer-term basis, 2018 was actually in line with 2016. It's exactly -- in fact, slightly higher than the midpoint of the range that we gave. We gave guidance to 95% to 97%, which I think is actually a very good number for our industry. I can't speak to the exact specific as to why 2017 was so high. What I would point out though as well is that our net retention rate is above 100%. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Furby from William Blair. 
Justin Furby: David, to start, can you give a sense for the growth trajectory? How are you thinking about growth in '19 between the Powerpay business and Dayforce embedded in your guidance? And then just what you think in terms of the Bureau contribution in 2019 as a percentage of your growth? And I've got a quick follow-up for Arthur. 
David Ossip: Sure. So in terms of the balance, obviously, the majority of the Cloud growth is coming from Dayforce. If I look historically in terms of the differences, if I look at Q4, on a GAAP basis, Dayforce revenue grew by 34.3%. On a constant currency basis, Dayforce revenue grew by 35% in Q4 of '18. And if I look at it on a Powerpay basis, on a GAAP basis, the growth rate of Powerpay was 2.8% and the constant currency growth rate was 7.4%. And as Dayforce is obviously the vast majority of the Cloud revenue, you would expect the majority of the growth of Cloud to come from the growth of Dayforce, and that would obviously continue into 2019. 
Justin Furby: Okay. And then the Bureau, David, in terms of the assumptions for '19 and what the percentage of mix coming from that is. 
David Ossip: Sure. We expect, obviously, the mix of Bureau to continue to drop. And Arthur, have we given guidance to what we expect the decline in Bureau to be in 2019? 
Arthur Gitajn: You can infer from -- we've given the total revenue in the Cloud guidance. But the Bureau retention was 86.9% in 2018 versus 89.7% in 2017, 87.4% in 2016. So we continue to be in the high 80s, and you can assume the same, excluding migrations to Dayforce. Migrations to Dayforce accounted for approximately 18% of our increase in Cloud revenue in '18. You should expect something in the neighborhood of 13% to 17% going forward. 
Justin Furby: Okay, that's helpful. And then, Arthur, just to be clear on the ARR, just the way you define it, it wouldn't include most of your Q4 bookings, is that right? I think it's just a live customer sort of run rate of ARR. And can you remind us, as you go through the year, what the seasonality of your new bookings looks like in terms of which quarters are the biggest? I think for Ulti, it was Q2 and Q4. What does it look like for you guys? 
David Ossip: It would be the same for us. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana from Jefferies. 
Samad Samana: David, when we were at INSIGHTS, I think one of the things that customers -- that they're pretty excited about was the On-Demand Pay solution that you're rolling out in early 2019. I was curious if you guys have determined a pricing model for that and how we should think about the potential monetization opportunity of that. And then I have a follow-up. 
David Ossip: Sure. I appreciate the question. We haven't disclosed to the market the pricing, but we do have several customers that are now in early stages of implementation with On-Demand. 
Samad Samana: Great. And then have you disclosed what the pricing model is? Is there -- Or maybe is it standard PEPM? Or is it based on wages? Maybe any color there would be helpful. 
David Ossip: It would be [ sort of ] per employee per month pricing model, but we haven't disclosed the dollar amount in the market. 
Samad Samana: Great, that's helpful. And then in terms of a follow-up, I was wondering, if we look at the average number of employees live per live customer, that was -- they grew about the same or consistent year-over-year. I'm curious, you've highlighted a lot of really nice-sized deals. Should we expect the average number of employees as you get these customers you've called out this year live to increase? Or how do you think about growth in units live next year versus total users as we're thinking about a model? 
David Ossip: So if I look at it on the total users, we saw an increase of 600,000 users between 2018 and 2017, and we saw that obviously across an increase of 717 customers that were taken live in '18 as compared to 662 customers that were taken live in 2017, which was obviously an increase from 569, which were taken live in 2016. So you've seen an upward trend per year in the number of accounts that we've been activating. We haven't obviously given guidance, as I mentioned earlier, into the number of customers we'd expect to go live to next year, but you can see what the historical trend has been. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Merwin from Goldman Sachs. 
Christopher Merwin: So just a follow-up on a comment, David, you made earlier about revenue per client. I think you called out module density as the main driver more so than the shift upmarket at least as it related to fiscal '18, but you continue to invest in R&D and roll out new products. Maybe can you just frame for us how we should be thinking about the opportunity for PEPM over the long term? And I've got a follow-up for Arthur. 
David Ossip: Chris, thank you for that. So a bit more color. If I look at the number of employees per customer, it was largely constant between 2017 and 2018. You can do the math yourself, 3.1 million active users in 2018 over a base of 3,718 customers versus 2.5 million employees right at the end of '17 on a base of 3,001. And so if you do the numbers, it averages out to obviously 833, slightly different, obviously, if you look at the median, which gives you actually a bit more accurate information. The increase that we saw in revenue per client -- and again, if you look at the increases, we went from $106,600 per customer in 2017 to $119,200 per customer in 2018, so a nice increase of about almost 12%. So the increase over there was driven by the add-on and the increased PEPM that we're getting from the new clients. And you'll see that again. If you look at the incremental revenue per new Dayforce customer, which was $152,000 in 2017, that grew by about 13% to $172,000 in 2018. We've always spoken about the platform opportunity in the marketplace, which effectively is we get the customer for payroll benefits and time and core HR. We work on making sure that they're very happy. And then we go back to them and we sell them the additional features as we release them. The cadence of building our products has been 2 to 3 new features per year, and as I said, we expect that cadence to continue into the future. And as such, I would expect the incremental revenue per client to go up regardless of our move upmarket. The second point is with Leagh joining the organization and a more focused go-to-market plan for the strategic accounts, strategic for us -- by the way, we've now defined as above 6,000 employees, and that involves having a more of a verticalization go-to-market strategy that extends all the way from sales to implementation to customer support. We would expect to see more success in that particular segment of the market, and so the average number of employees should go up. 
Christopher Merwin: And then just for Arthur, looks like professional services gross margins under 606 were negative 14% in '18. And under 605, I think you called out negative 41%. So just as we think through the 606 transition, anything you can share in the trajectory of professional services gross margins getting to breakeven, especially as we see the mix shift change over of professional services related to customers that you already have live? 
Arthur Gitajn: Sure. So for the full year 2017, we see the professional services margin would have gone from negative 87.8% to negative 32% under 606. For full year 2018, professional services margin would have increased from a negative 40.8% to a negative 14.3%, would have improved. And in Q4 last year, we were at negative 17% before 606. After 606, we're at -- we're, I believe, in the tens, 10.6%. So I think that we're in the --  we're probably in the minus 10% to breakeven range going forward. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nandan Amladi from Guggenheim Partners. 
Nandan Amladi: So in the selling cycle, David, I know your customers tend to be little bit larger, 800-plus average. Are you seeing any changes in their behavior in the sense of decision-making process, the number of steps you have to go through, any of that really as it relates to sort of the macro environment? 
David Ossip: As you've seen with us and others, obviously, Q4 is a very healthy buying quarter. So I haven't seen any changes in the macro environment. And if I look at the pipeline into 2019, I don't see any either. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citi. 
Walter Pritchard: Two questions. One for David, one for Arthur. David, on the U.K. market rollout, is -- any update there in terms of timing, contribution to your thinking about for 2019? And then I had a follow-up. 
David Ossip: So we issued a press release a couple of days ago announcing a few go-lives that we've had in the U.K. on our native payroll product. So we are now beginning to see customers get activated on that major U.K. product. We will be having another summit in the U.K., I believe, within the May time frame. And so we obviously are seeing pipeline development and market demand. So we're quite happy at the moment. We've also begun ramping up the sales organization in the U.K. As it pertains to 2019, the impact would obviously be towards the end of the year and obviously into 2020. 
Walter Pritchard: Great. And then, Arthur, as it relates to the professional services allocation as we look at 2019, should we expect it to roughly look like it did in 2018 after the 606 accounting takes hold? 
Arthur Gitajn: Yes. I think, again, I think Q4 is a fair indicator. Yes. 
Walter Pritchard: Okay, great. And then actually, last one just on investments. It looks like you did ramp up your investments as it related to Q4. And I'm wondering if you think about your -- especially on the sale side, the kind of efficiency you're getting and so forth, how should we think about that through the course of 2019? 
David Ossip: So if we look at the actual numbers, you'll see that the sales and marketing expense in Q4 of '18 was $35.8 million as compared to $31.8 million in Q4 of '17. So we increased the actual spend there quite a bit. The reason for that is obviously increased commissions, which drove a lot of it as well we have our customer conference, which falls into October, so it's booked in Q4. Going forward, we'll continue to invest in sales and marketing, but the changes aren't going to be a big step. So continue to be very focused investments that have high returns. 
Operator: I now turn the call back over to David Ossip for closing remarks. 
David Ossip: Just thank you, everyone, for joining the call today, and I look forward to our future conversations. 
Operator: That concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q3  (2018-10-29 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Ceridian Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. 
 I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jeremy Johnson, the Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations at Ceridian. Thank you, sir. Please begin.

As a reminder, all figures discussed on this conference call are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. 
 And with that, I will turn the call over to David. 
David Ossip: Thanks, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. 
 The third quarter of 2018 was another strong quarter for the company as we continue to execute on our strategic initiatives. Market demand for Dayforce remained strong. Dayforce revenue grew 36% year-over-year and Cloud revenue grew by 29%. On a constant-currency basis, Dayforce revenue grew 37% year-over-year and Cloud revenue grew 31%. We had 3,465 customers live on the Dayforce platform at the end of the third quarter, an increase of 157 customers from the second quarter of 2018, an increase of 610 customers from the same period last year. 
 We also recorded net income this quarter of $4.4 million compared to last year's net loss of $20.1 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased 28% year-over-year, and we achieved a 290 basis point improvement in our adjusted EBITDA margin to 20.3%. We are raising the range of our full year 2018 revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance to reflect our strong Q3 results. Arthur will go into more detail, but I want to walk through the progression of our Q3 results and our Q4 guidance. 
 We exceeded the high-end range of our third quarter guidance on adjusted EBITDA by about $4.5 million. A portion of this beat is attributed to the revenue over-performance, which exceeded the high-end range of our third quarter guidance by about $2.5 million. The remaining $2 million adjusted Q3 EBITDA over-performance is due to lower expenses that are primarily timing on spending between Q3 and Q4. 
 In addition, we have approved an additional $2 million of expenses to support the growth of the business that includes: sales bonuses and commissions to close out a strong year, implementation expenses tied to the activation in Q4 of what we anticipate to be the largest go-live quarter ever in terms of recurring revenue taken live, an additional Orlando HCM Summit that will be held in December to help drive Q4 and Q1 sales, and continued hiring in the sales organization to drive growth in future years. But to reiterate, even with this additional $2 million of expenses and with the movement of expenses between Q3 and Q4, we are raising both our full year adjusted EBITDA and revenue guidance. 
 I would like to now discuss our continued product innovation and market momentum. In October, we held our annual customer conference, INSIGHTS. The conference was successful. We had about 3,000 attendees, and more than 50 customers presented their Ceridian success stories. 
 At INSIGHTS, we discussed new and near-term Dayforce platform features, including, succession planning, advanced analytics, benefit decision support, engagement surveys, compensation data benchmarking and On-Demand Pay. These available and soon-to-be-available modules allows us to increase our target recurring revenue pricing. 
 One innovation we are particularly excited about is On-Demand Pay that will allow employees to use our mobile applications to access their earned wages before the end of the pay period. We believe that this will make work life better for the millions of people that use Dayforce and that Ceridian will be the first to bring to market an on-demand payment solution based on a continuous calculation of payroll. 
 In terms of our global footprint, at INSIGHTS, we also announced that in addition to Australia, we intend to expand our global payroll solution to Ireland and New Zealand. The additions of Ireland and New Zealand as the next location to roll out our major payroll functionality will help round out the U.K. and Ireland and ANZ regions. We plan to have Australian native payroll ready for the start of the 2019 Australian payroll year. And as you know, we already have live customers using our native U.K. payroll. We expect to continue to expand our native payroll functionality while also expanding countries covered by our ConnectedPay solution. 
 I would also like to note some of the additional recognitions we received this quarter. I'm delighted that we continue to be recognized for having a great culture. In fact, we are an example of how using Dayforce has allowed us to create a culture of innovation and how that has led to organizational performance. 
 To this end, I'm very proud that in the quarter, Ceridian was recognized as a great workplace by Great Place to Work for the fourth consecutive year, and Ceridian was also recognized as a 2018 award winner of the Working Mothers 100 Best Companies. I would also like to congratulate Lisa Sterling, our Chief People and Culture Officer, who was named the Working Mother of the Year by Working Mother Media. Our success at Ceridian is a direct reflection of the passion and dedication of our people, who represent the core of our innovation and cultural excellence. 
 We also received several awards that reflect our continued excellence in product development and services. For the sixth straight year, Dayforce was named a leader in Nucleus Research's HCM Technology Value Matrix. The report highlights Ceridian's latest functionality, including the launch of Dayforce payroll in the U.K., the rollout of enhanced predictive analytics and the releases of new Dayforce talent modules, including compensation management and learning management. 
 We were also recognized by Constellation Research, a Silicon Valley technology and research advisory firm, as the leading solution for workforce management and payroll. And Dayforce talent management modules recently won a Gold Stevie Award at the third annual Stevie Awards for Great Employers. 
 On the services side, Dayforce received a HCM Customer Experience gold medal by Software Reviews, a world-class customer review platform. And at the recent Technology Service Industry Association's STAR Award, our robotic process automation implementation tool, Dayforce Activate, won the award for innovation in enabling customer outcomes - professional services. Regarding all these awards, we are very proud to be recognized as an engaged, innovative and customer-focused organization and for delivering products and services that help transform cultures and make work life better for us and our customers. 
 In summary, we are pleased with our performance in the third quarter, and we are excited by the opportunity that lies ahead. I want to close with 2 final items: First, I want to reiterate our long-term goal, which we have spoken about on previous calls. We aspire to be a $1 billion cloud revenue company. And with that goal, we expect recurring gross margin of the business to be 75% or greater, professional service and other gross margin to be breakeven and adjusted EBITDA margin to be 30% or greater. Second, I want to thank all our employees for their outstanding effort, and I especially want to thank our customers for their continued partnership. 
 I will now turn it over to Arthur to discuss our financial results and guidance with even greater detail. 
Arthur Gitajn: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. As David mentioned, we're very pleased with our performance in the third quarter ended September 30, 2018. 
 Dayforce revenue increased by $29.4 million or 36% to $111.7 million. Cloud revenue, which includes both Dayforce and Powerpay, increased by $30 million or 29% to $133 million. And total revenue, which includes revenue from both our Cloud and Bureau solutions, increased by $16.1 million or 10% to $179.6 million. On a constant-currency basis, Dayforce revenue grew by 37%, Cloud revenue grew by 31% and total revenue grew 11%. 
 During our last call, we provided guidance for the third quarter, and I'm pleased to report that our actual results for Cloud revenue exceeded the high end of the range by $2 million. Our actual results for total revenue exceeded the high end of the range by $2.6 million, and our actual results for adjusted EBITDA exceeded the high end of the range by $4.4 million. 
 Cloud revenue growth in the third quarter was driven by a 29.5% increase in Cloud recurring services revenue and a 27.5% increase in Cloud professional services and other revenue. Of the $30 million increase in Cloud revenue, $5.6 million or 19% was attributable to Bureau customers migrating to Dayforce. Excluding the impact of migrations to Dayforce, revenue from Bureau solutions declined by $8.3 million or 13.7%, which was in line with our expectations. 
 Cloud revenue accounted for 74% of our total revenue in the third quarter this year compared to 63% in the third quarter last year. Sequentially, Q2 2018 to Q3 2018 Cloud recurring services revenue was up by $5.5 million. 
 Q3 revenue from Powerpay, our Cloud HR and payroll solution for the Canadian small business market, increased 3% to $21.3 million. On a constant-currency basis, excluding the impact of the year-over-year decline in the Canadian dollar, Powerpay revenue increased by 8%. 
 The average float balance for our customer trust funds during the third quarter was approximately $2.97 billion compared to $2.94 billion in the third quarter last year. The average yield on our float balance was 2.11% during the third quarter, an increase of 55 basis points compared to the average yield in the third quarter last year. As a result, income from invested customer trust funds was $15.8 million in the third quarter compared to $11.6 million in the third quarter last year. 
 We also continued to expand our gross margins and operating margins during the third quarter. While Cloud recurring services revenue grew $25.3 million or 29.5%, our cost of Cloud recurring services to support this growth increased by only $4 million or 13%. And our gross margin on Cloud recurring services increased from 63% in the third quarter last year to 68%, reflecting an increase in the proportion of Dayforce customers live for more than 2 years from 57% in the third quarter last year to 62%, and our ability to realize economies of scale in customer support and hosting costs. 
 While professional services and other revenue grew $4.5 million or 25%, professional services and other costs were reduced by $2.3 million or 7%, primarily due to productivity improvements in implementing new customers, reflecting the increased experience of our implementation consultants and the continued use of automation in our implementation processes. 
 Continuing the trend from last quarter, our negative margin on professional services and other revenue improved from negative 94% in the third quarter last year to negative 45%, reflecting an increase in profitable post-go-live professional services and productivity improvements in implementing new customers. 
 Product development and management expenses increased by $3.5 million or 32% to $14.5 million, primarily due to increased research and development costs. Overall, we generated a $16.1 million increase in total revenue with a $2.4 million increase in total cost of revenues. And gross profit increased by $13.7 million or 22% to $75 million. 
 Selling, general and administrative expense increased $7 million to $59.4 million. Included in SG&A is $29.7 million of sales and marketing costs representing 16.5% of revenue and up $2.7 million or 10% compared to the third quarter last year. 
 We realized an operating profit of $15.3 million in the third quarter compared to operating profit of $5.1 million in the third quarter last year, up 200% year-over-year. As David discussed, net income attributable to Ceridian increased by $24.5 million to a net income of $4.4 million compared to a net loss of $20.1 million in the third quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 28% to $36.4 million from $28.4 million last year. Interest expense was reduced by $13.1 million due to the redemption of the senior notes during the second quarter of 2018, and income tax expense was reduced by $1.8 million. 
 Moving to the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $188 million, an increase of $93.8 million compared to December 31, 2017. And our total debt was $671.8 million, a reduction of $448 million compared to December 31, 2017. The $93.8 million increase in cash and the $448 million reduction in debt are primarily attributable to the IPO and refinancing of our term debt. 
 Our capital expenditures through the first 9 months of 2018 were $28.7 million compared to $32.1 million through the first 9 months last year. Included in $28.7 million in capital expenditures were $21.9 million for software and technology and $6.8 million for property and equipment. 
 Turning now to our outlook for the full year of fiscal 2018. Our performance through the first 9 months of the year provides us with the confidence to raise our full year fiscal 2018 outlook as follows: Cloud revenue is now expected to be in the range of $532 million to $534 million. Total revenue is now expected to be in the range of $741 million to $743 million. And as David discussed, given our overperformance in the third quarter, adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $150 million to $153 million. I would also note that our guidance for the remainder of the year assumes no significant changes in foreign exchange rates. 
 At this time, I'm going to ask the operator to open up the lines for any questions you may have. Thank you. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alex Zukin from Piper Jaffray. 
Aleksandr Zukin: Can you maybe talk about what are your biggest priorities kind of with the new head of sales and how your -- how maybe you or she is thinking about incremental hiring and potential impact on OpEx for maybe the outyear? 
David Ossip: Alex, thanks for joining us this morning. Thanks for the compliments. In terms of Leagh, as you know, Leagh joined us from SAP, where most recently she was global CEO of strategic accounts. When we look at the future growth of the business, we'll continue doing very well in disrupting the HCM market in the current segments that we have been very successful. With Leagh as well, we'll have more of a focus now on what we term strategic accounts, which are accounts that are toward the larger side, and that requires a slightly different approach to market in terms of how we market, how we approach the customers, how we cultivate the actual account. 
 Along with that, we will accelerate hiring in that particular segment in terms of sales and marketing support. In addition, we are also focused on growing the business from a global basis. And so you will see additional headcount in both the U.K. and in Australia as we look to expand. In terms of how we'll increase the headcount, it will be gradual increases of headcount. We don't provide sales headcount numbers to the marketplace. I don't expect that you'll see any dramatics changes in the sales and marketing expenses. 
Aleksandr Zukin: Got it. And just maybe one follow-up. As you continue to kind of see more traction in the marketplace, any changes that you're observing in the competitive environment, particularly maybe any commentary on win rates as you introduce some of this new functionality around continuous pay and On-Demand Pay? 
David Ossip: So the On-Demand Pay will be released in early 2019. In terms of win rates and in terms of the competitive environment, it remains largely unchanged. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. 
Mark Murphy: So David, you had several intriguing product announcements at the recent INSIGHTS conference. I'm just wondering where do you see the strongest response and the largest revenue opportunity. And specifically, based on the initial responses, do you see a strong opportunity to go out and monetize for On-Demand Pay? 
David Ossip: At INSIGHTS, we announced quite a few new products. Available already is succession management. That follows learning management and compensation management, which are also added in effectively 2018. The adding of additional modules allows us to effectively increase our target pattern for employee per month pricing, and it also provides us with an opportunity to go back to the account that are already live and provide add-on sales. 
 In terms of the on-demand pricing, we haven't released pricing to the market yet. But yes, I do believe that it will give us an opportunity to increase revenue from existing and from future accounts. And as well, it should increase our competitiveness in the marketplace as we are the first to offer on-demand pay calculated on a continuous calculation of payroll. In other words, we know precisely what people are -- have earned, and we allow them now to access those wages. 
Mark Murphy: Great. And as a follow-up, Arthur, I believe you said that 62% of Dayforce customers are now live for more than 2 years. And we did notice that, that did improve year-over-year. I'm wondering what role is your Activate product playing in that improvement. And if you have any early thoughts on where you see that 62% level getting to at this time next year. 
Arthur Gitajn: Yes. We haven't projected it out. Certainly, the productivity improvements in implementation, including Activate and also the experience of our consulting organization, helps us increase the efficiency with which we're bringing customers live. And again, it's evidenced by the reduction in the negative margin on professional services and other. 
David Ossip: Mark, If I could just add to that. With Activate, we are now using the product in all segments of the market. If you recall, we introduced the product originally for the small- and medium-sized segments. The product's now been expanded to handle the larger accounts as well. 
 And another benefit of Activate beyond the reduced cycle times and the reduction in effort is that we get consistent configuration of customers. And that makes it easier for us to support the accounts, and it has been very helpful in driving an increase in the improvement in the gross margin of recurring. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Crédit Suisse. 
Brad Zelnick: My question, David, can you give us a sense of the average pricing for the average mid-market customer versus the maximum PEPM on Dayforce? Or said differently, what's the current adoption rate? And at what pace do you see it growing relative to the pace of innovation you're targeting? 
David Ossip: So Brad, it's really consistent, I'll say, with prior quarters that in any quarter, approximately 20% of the ACV or sales tends to be add-on sales to customers that are already live. And in terms of the target PEPM pricing or the realized pricing that we're seeing, at say, the 1,000-employee firm level, it appears to be around $20 to $25. 
Brad Zelnick: And just for Arthur, post-go-live professional services, it's nice to see the margin progression there. Is there any reason we wouldn't see continued similar improvement moving forward? 
Arthur Gitajn: Actually, next year, with -- as we adopt ASC 606, under ASC 606, our margin on professional services would be minus 14%. So we're very -- we'd be very close to breakeven already. 
David Ossip: Brad, just on that again, I remember that the gross margin on professional services and other consists really of 3-line items: You have the services related to activation of the account, which currently sits, I believe, at around 52% of that line item. You have professional services to customers that are already live, and that currently is now 29%; and then you have effectively a clock, which are the time and attendance readers that we sell, which is currently about 18%. 
 What's driving the improvement in professional services and other gross margin is the shift in mix. Last year in Q3, the professional services, which is again the services to customers that are already live, was 19%. This year, it is now 29%. And as that percentage continues to grow, the overall margin of professional services and other gross margin will continue to improve. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. 
Raimo Lenschow: David, can you talk a little bit about what you see on Bureau? Like, obviously, like you kind of manage the numbers down here. Is there -- first of all, like the decline increased a little bit? But then I also wanted to think more longer term. As Dayforce gets more powerful, is there a thinking at some point to kind of accelerate the migration even further? And then I had a follow-up for Arthur. 
David Ossip: So Raimo, thanks for that. Again, the business today is -- the majority of the business today is the Cloud revenue. As of Q3 of 2018, 74% of our revenue is now Cloud. In terms of migrations from the Bureau, it is with inside the range of that we gave -- that we spoke about at the end of last year, which is at 15% to 20%. I think we came in, I believe, at 18.7% in this particular quarter. 
Arthur Gitajn: Correct. 
David Ossip: In terms of accelerating migrations, we are more focused on acquiring new customers, as we always have. As you know, always around 75% of our Dayforce accounts have been net-new account or add-on sales to existing Dayforce accounts. The Bureau will continue to decline, as we've mentioned, until it reaches about $100 million or so. And that point, we expect that the decline will basically flatten out. Because inside that line item, we have the stand-alone tax business and a few other businesses. 
Arthur Gitajn: Raimo, I would also add that even though we saw a little bit of an uptick in Q3, over the first 9 months, when you exclude the impact of migrations, Bureau revenue declined 11%. And then just for comparison, the decline last year, excluding migrations, was about 10%. The decline the year before, excluding migrations, was about 11%. So again, I think we're in line. 
Raimo Lenschow: Okay, perfect. Makes sense. And then Arthur, on the cost side, like can you just talk me through a little bit in terms of the -- how much more is expected on the Q3 bigger pic. Like, for example, the conference, kind of you knew. And how much was kind of unexpected in terms of cost moving from Q3, Q2, Q4? 
Arthur Gitajn: A lot of the timing has to do with headcount. When you hire headcount at the end of a quarter, you get a much bigger full quarter impact in Q4. 
Raimo Lenschow: Yes. But that was kind of pretty much it, like the conference, et cetera, you knew, so it's really more headcount and then business performance? 
David Ossip: Raimo, just -- the conference actually was in Q4. It was in October. 
Raimo Lenschow: Yes, yes, yes. No, that's what I meant. Like but you knew it. Like it's a little bit what I meant. Okay. 
David Ossip: Sure. But already, the timing of payments and et cetera, also kind of fluctuates towards the end of the quarter as well. But again, as I mentioned, about $2 million of the beat of the Q3 EBITDA overperformance was due to the movement of expenses between Q3 and Q4. But even with that movement, and with the additional approved $2 million of expenses, we did increase our EBITDA guidance for the year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird. 
Mark Marcon: I was wondering, with regards to the new clients that have come onboard, what are you seeing in terms of differences in terms of the number of new modules that they're taking on? How would you characterize the broadening of the suite over the last quarter and year, 2 years, et cetera? 
David Ossip: So Mark, thanks again. As I mentioned, about 20% of each quarter's sales are add-on sales to the existing base. As well, we are -- we generally do see an uptick in the realized PEPM that we're able to get from the actual marketplace. We launched the modules, which were conversation management and learning management towards the, I would say, the middle of the year. So we haven't yet had enough data to kind of reflect back as to what the new realized price is for the market. But I would expect it to go up year-over-year and into the future as well. 
Mark Marcon: Great. And then between INSIGHTS and some of the market-specific client events that you've been hosting and getting a lot of interest, I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about how the sales pipeline looks right now. I know what you mentioned with regards to the implementations. But in terms of new sales, RFPs, how that stands relative to a year ago? And how that seems to be tracking? 
David Ossip: So Mark, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we still see a very strong demand for Dayforce product in the marketplace. And as well, some of the additional $2 million of expenses that we preapproved for Q4 has to do with sales bonuses and commissions, which are, obviously, tied to sales. 
Mark Marcon: Great. And then in terms of -- Arthur, in terms of the Cloud revenue guidance, what are you expecting in terms of -- or what are you baking in, in terms of exchange rate? Or said another way, what's the expectation on a constant-currency basis in terms of the growth rate on the Cloud side? 
Arthur Gitajn: So we're assuming no further erosion, no further weakening right now in the Canadian dollar. And so you'd have a little bit of a headwind in Q4 as a result of the year-over-year exchange. What we're assuming -- well, is that we would maintain where we are today in terms of exchange rates. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Justin Furby with William Blair & Co. 
Justin Furby: Maybe just quickly, a housekeeping item first. Arthur, I think during your comments in the prepared remarks, you said Cloud recurring grew 25.9% in Q3. I just want to be clear, the growth was, I think, was 29.5%. And maybe I misheard, but I just wanted to make sure that's right. 
Arthur Gitajn: I believe it's 29.5% on Cloud recurring and 27.5% on professional services and other. 
Justin Furby: Great. And then the last few quarters on that line item, on Cloud recurring growth, you've seen a little bit of deceleration. It seems like your guidance -- and I know you don't explicitly guide between services and recurring, but it feels you're kind of guiding for sort of high 20s implied Cloud recurring growth, which seems sort of stable quarter-on-quarter. Is that the right read? And then, maybe just for David or Arthur, just in terms of the medium-term and longer-term Cloud recurring growth, can you give us a sense for what you think a sustainable level is? 
Arthur Gitajn: Well, again, I'd just point out that Cloud revenue actually increased sequentially from $127.8 million in Q2 to $133 million on a -- and on a constant-currency basis, Cloud revenue grew 31.3%. Over time, as your base of revenue gets larger, even with the increasing dollar value, the math will affect your percentage. But it's become so commonplace, we take it for granted. Even with the effects of the weakening Canadian dollar, we've set new records for Dayforce and Cloud revenue each and every quarter for the last 7 quarters. And we will, by all -- by our expectations, we're going to set new records again in Q4. 
Justin Furby: Right. I guess, Arthur, what I was explicitly asking was, if you look at the last 3 quarters, your cloud recurring been high 30s, mid-30s, 30% this quarter. And it feels like you're guiding to a similar level in Q4. Is that fair or no? 
Arthur Gitajn: I think that's fair. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Deutsche Bank. 
Michael Turrin: You've been adding sort of consistently around 150 Dayforce go-live customers per quarter. I think I heard you reference that you're expecting Q4 to be a record number there. So does that mean it's the right way to think about that? That, that means we could see back to the 200-plus number that we saw in Q2 of last year? And if so, are there any comments you can make around the average size or segmentation of that customer base? 
David Ossip: So if I look at the actual add-on based on our live Dayforce customers, it effectively seems to hover between a range of about 130 to about 200 customers on a quarter-by-quarter basis. So if I look at Q3, we added 157, Q2 was 154, Q1 was 153, Q4 was 146 and so on. The amount of revenue that we activate is driven by the number of customers, but there's also the average size of customer. And we have seen the average size of customer go up year-over-year. In terms of Q4, as I mentioned, we -- part of the $2 million of additional expenses is tied to implementation expenses related to the activation or taking live of the record number of customers in Q4. So we would expect, obviously, to see positive numbers coming out of that group. 
Arthur Gitajn: The average trailing 12-months revenue per Dayforce customer in Q3 was $118,000, which is an increase of about $15,000 or 15% compared to $103,000 to the trailing 12 months in Q3 2017. And as David said, that's a combination of both increased size of customer and increased product density. 
Michael Turrin: That's helpful. And then looking out to the full year guidance, you're raising Cloud revenue guidance by more than the Q3 beat, which seems to imply some good confidence in the momentum you're seeing. But the EBITDA number for Q4 that's implied might be a touch lighter than some of us were expecting. So I was just wondering if you could just hit on the trade-off of how you balance those 2. And what you're thinking about as you're kind of heading into the exit of the year this year. 
David Ossip: Again, let me try to be clear. So within Q3, we beat the high end of our EBITDA adjusted guidance by about $4.5 million. Two, about $2 million of that beat was a timing difference, so you can effectively take down the Q4 number we gave out previously by that $2 million. And then in addition, we have preapproved expenses of an additional $2 million related to sales, bonuses, commissions, implementation expenses related to the activation of the accounts in Q4. We've added an additional summit that will be held in December in Orlando, and we're also continuing to hire in the sales function. So if you take the $2 million of timing, if you take the $2 million of additional preapproved expense, that amounts to $4 million. And that's basically what we've taken out of the Q4 number. But even with that, we have increased our adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies. 
Samad Samana: First, Arthur, just maybe a housekeeping question. The 30% adjusted EBITDA margin at $1 billion of revenue, is that factoring in the changeover to ASP 606? Or is that under the 605 framework? And then I have a follow-up. 
Arthur Gitajn: It's factoring in ASC 606. And again, when we originally implement ASC 606 next -- in the first quarter of next year, we'll be restating all of the comparable prior period numbers to give you apples-and-apples comparisons. 
Samad Samana: Great. That's helpful. And then maybe, David, as we think about the rollout of U.K. payroll and customers being live on that now and the announcement of Australia and New Zealand and Ireland, can you help us maybe think about the revenue opportunity. And how the company is thinking about the expanded revenue opportunity selling native payroll into those markets? And maybe just the ramp time for that. 
David Ossip: Sure. So in terms of growth, obviously, the short-term growth comes from continuing to disrupt our existing markets in a way that we've been doing over the last number of years. In terms of, I would say, late '19 -- or early '20 growth, that's going to be driven, I would suspect, from the movement into strategic accounts. And on the global side, that is more longer-term growth as the lead time, if you like, is slightly longer. And so you'll start to see that in late 2020 and late 2021 -- going into 2021. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Davis with Canaccord. 
Richard Davis: So it's interesting. Last week, I had breakfast with the CEO of a company that they call themselves kind of LinkedIn for everyone else, which means kind of the ecosystem of people that work in the gig economy. So when I look at your products, I mean I know Powerpay is more Canadian. Is there -- how do you guys participate in that kind of more fluid segment of the employment market? So it's obviously hourly workers, but if you work in a restaurant, you switch jobs from place to place or if you work at UPS and stuff like that. How are you participating in that space? And how should we think about that? 
David Ossip: So Richard, the on-demand pay functionality that we announced at INSIGHTS allows us to provide a unique service to the gig economy, where effectively, people can clock in, clock off with their mobile devices. And as their shifts get approved, we can calculate the net earnings, net of all the deductions, et cetera, and we can facilitate payment immediately to a digital wallet for them. So that's the first piece from our product side. And we believe we're quite unique in that regard, that we have this continuous calculation. Any time you clock in, clock out, modify any part of the HR record, we recalculate the net earnings. And that's unique to us. 
 The second area we see the rise of the gig economy is that we see more demand from staffing companies, particularly in the human services businesses. So you typically see a nurse company, where they provide either on-demand nurse staff or they might provide a short-term nurse staff, say, for a week or up to, say, a few months. And we, obviously, participate in that as well. 
Richard Davis: One just quick strategic question. I don't know if there's any answer on this. But look, artificial intelligence is a hot topic these days. Is there any way -- because when you apply AI to people, are there ways that you can provide kind of guide rails -- guardrails to kind of ensure that AI is not replicating existing biases and then also kind of accountability? I just feel that's going to be a hot topic as we kind of push this stuff into the space. 
David Ossip: So Richard, that's a good question. Look, I think people have to move away from the word AI because it's not -- the technology is not there at the moment. In terms of predictive technologies, the tech that exists today is really around machine learning and possibly some deep learning. Most of the advances have been in image recognition, so you'll see areas like voice recognition and such, gaining a lot of traction, a lot of improvement year-over-year. Within Dayforce, we have a Dayforce assist, which we now have customers using, which is our voice tech, which allows employees to basically say, hey, Google; or hey, Cortana; or hey, Siri; or hey, Alexa; ask Dayforce when I'm next scheduled to work. Sorry, that's not great. Sorry about that. I have no idea how to turn that off. Sorry about that. Right. But we've got the Dayforce voice activated quite nicely. 
 We also use ML quite a bit in -- or predictive models, if you like, to determine where people might be at risk of leaving an organization. We don't go into the area of trying to make decisions about people using ML tech because we don't see any empirical evidence by any of the tech out there that justifies that. And we, obviously, do a lot of research and a lot of lab types of programs around that sort of tech. We also use predictive tech quite a bit in the support functions, so we continually mine the usage data of our clients' data or how people are using the application. And we're able to use that to predict when we should call a customer to resolve a support item before it becomes a support issue. And that's been quite well received by our customers, and we've seen increases in NPS scores and such from that. 
 And the other area that we use kind of -- other areas where we use a lot of predictive tech, one has to do with the deployment of labor, where we're able to look at a past data, predict out when people are required, and then use various types of algorithms to help managers position labor that's really aligned to the objective and the strategies of the company. We do the same thing in compensation management, where we're able to look at data for a team, understand if there's any gender or diversity bias or such inside a particular group, look at our now market compensation data by locality, again, to determine if there are some adjustments. And then we're able to give the managers a starting worksheet that helps move people's salary ranges in terms of merit and bonus to align with the strategic objectives, again, of the actual company. 
 So for us kind of use of predictive tech is very well embedded inside the product. It has been from the very outset of Dayforce. We continue to look at the advances in kind of ML and deep learning and other types of predictive techs, but we're quite pragmatic about using the technology in a way that there is strong evidence. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citibank. 
Walter Pritchard: Two questions, I guess, for Arthur. On the pricing, could you talk about PEPM impact there? And how we should think about it in segments and so forth? And on the expense side, the accelerated pace of spending in Q4 around the summits and so forth, how should we expect that type of spend to unfold as we move into '19? 
David Ossip: So what -- let me just take that. So in terms of the summit, you'll see a similar type of cadence to what we've done in the latter half of this year. So just to put it in perspective, we had a summit in New York, I believe, in June. We then had an event in Chicago. We had another summit in London. We then followed that with INSIGHTS, it's for our customer conference in October. And we are going to have another summit now in December in Orlando. So the cadence seems to be about 1 about every, I suppose, 2 months or so that we seem to have a summit. And I think that's probably the pace that you'll see in terms of summits. So you could kind of model out what we've spent I suppose in the second half of this year. And it'll be something similar like that going forward. 
 In terms of PEPM pricing, as I mentioned beforehand, we expect that the realized PEPM to go up over time. But we haven't really provided new guidance numbers for that. 
Walter Pritchard: Maybe help us just understand order of magnitude of some of the value on some of these features that you're rolling out, how that might relate to some of the value you've been able to capture on prior features. 
David Ossip: It's similar to the prior feature. Depending on the module that we're rolling out, it could be anything from $1 to a few dollars per employee per month. 
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, thank you for your participation.

As a reminder, all figures discussed on this conference call are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.
 With that, I will turn the call over to David. 
David Ossip: Thanks, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call.
 I'm pleased to report that Ceridian had another strong quarter. We achieved Cloud revenue growth of 36% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 49%, which drove a 440 basis point improvement in our adjusted EBITDA margin. Revenue from Dayforce, our flagship Cloud HCM platform, grew over 40% during the quarter, reflecting continued strong market demand. We had 3,308 customers live on the Dayforce platform at the end of the second quarter, an increase of 154 customers from the first quarter of 2018 and an increase of 618 customers from the same date last year.
 As I mentioned last quarter, as part of our planning process for 2019, we have been evaluating the acceleration of investments in several growth initiatives in the second half of 2018. These initiatives include investments in people, product and sales. With respect to investments in people, I'm thrilled to announce the appointment of Leagh Turner as President and Erik Zimmer as Chief Strategy Officer. In addition, we have decided to separate the roles of President and Chief Operating Officer, with Paul Elliott serving as COO until May 2019. 
 Leagh has over 20 years of experience in the software industry and has served in many senior leadership roles within SAP over the last decade, most recently as Global Chief Operating Officer of SAP Strategic Customer Program, and prior to that, was SAP's COO of EMEA and Canada. Leagh brings a breadth of experience and expertise that will help us continue to drive growth and expand globally. 
 Erik joins us from T.H. Lee. I've had the pleasure of working with Erik over the past 7 years in his role as a Managing Director of T.H. Lee's operating group. Erik was very involved in the design and development of our Dayforce Activate technology, which has significantly reduced implementation hours and cycle times for our customers. We are very excited to welcome both Leagh and Erik to the Ceridian team.
 In addition, we have added Steve Weintraub as VP of Professional Services, reporting to Head of Services, Adrian Grbavac. Prior to Ceridian, Steve was President, North America at NGA Human Resources. Steve's focus is to optimize the professional services organization as we expand delivery of profitable post go-live professional services to our customers and improve overall professional services gross margin. 
 With respect to product initiatives, after completing native payroll in the U.K., with our first customers going live this past quarter, we are accelerating the build-out of native payroll functionality in Australia and expect completion early next year. We are in the process of building on-demand pay capabilities for Dayforce and other initiatives around emerging gig economy, which we'll highlight in October at our annual customer conference, INSIGHTS. And we are accelerating the development of additional talent modules, including succession planning, which will also be demonstrated at INSIGHTS.
 With respect to sales and marketing, we are adding additional headcount across sales, marketing and business development organization, and we have increased the number of HCM summits that we'll host this year, including Chicago, which will be held next week; London in September; and Hawaii in late August.
 Our HCM summits are 1-, 2-day conferences designed to connect our existing customers with leaders and decision-makers at prospective companies to discuss why they selected Ceridian and what their experience has been working with us. An example of a recent win from an HCM summit is a 5,000-employee mortgage finance company based out of Chicago that selected us shortly after attending the HCM summit in Denver.
 During the second quarter, we also hosted a HCM summit in New York, which was extremely well-attended, so much so that we had to change venues to accommodate all of the attendees. We are excited by the positive traction that Dayforce has achieved in the marketplace, and we believe our customer engagement events are critical to sustain our positive sales momentum.
 I'm also proud of the continued recognition that Ceridian received for our culture and products in the past quarter. First, after an extensive third-party evaluation, we were EDGE-certified for gender balance, equal pay for equivalent work, effectiveness of policies and practices and inclusiveness of culture. In addition, Ceridian was recently recognized by independent analysts as the Best Workplace for Women by Great Place to Work. And on our products, Dayforce continues to be recognized as a leading HCM solution, most recently highlighted by winning gold for Most Innovative Company of the Year as part of Network Products Guide's Annual IT World Awards. In summary, we are pleased with our performance in the second quarter, and we are extremely excited about the tremendous opportunity that lies ahead. Thank you again for your time and continued support. 
 I'll now turn it over to Arthur. 
Arthur Gitajn: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. This is our first quarterly financial report reflecting our performance as a public company since our IPO at the end of April. And I want to take a few minutes to highlight some of the IPO-related items in our Q2 2018 Form 10-Q, which was filed this morning and is available on the U.S. SEC EDGAR website.
 First, Note 1 to the financial statements, beginning on Page 9, provides the detailed accounting for the IPO and the use of IPO proceeds. The primary use of IPO proceeds was to redeem $475 million of senior notes, which saves the company more than $50 million a year in interest expense going forward. And after associated fees and expenses, we ended up with an additional $68.6 million in cash on the balance sheet as well. Second, as discussed in Note 8, beginning on Page 19, at the same time, when we refinanced our remaining debt, and we now have a new $680 million term loan and a $300 million revolving credit facility. 
 In addition, as discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, beginning on Page 13 of the 10-Q, contemporaneous with the IPO, we distributed our controlling financial interests in Lifeworks to our pre-IPO stockholders. As a result, Lifeworks has been reclassified and presented as discontinued operations, and our financial statements now present only one reportable segment, our Human Capital Management, or HCM, business. For your reference, we provided quarterly financial, quarterly income statements excluding Lifeworks for the first quarter this year and for each of the 4 quarters in 2017 as a schedule in our press release.
 And finally, in the interest of providing more disclosure on the impact of share-based compensation and other adjustments, we provided new tables in our Management Discussion & Analysis on Pages 36 and 37, detailing share-based comp expense and other adjustments by expense line and reconciling our reported results to our adjusted results for the second quarter and year-to-date in 2018 and for the comparable periods last year.
 As David mentioned, we are very pleased with our performance in the second quarter ended June 30, 2018. Dayforce revenue increased by $31 million or 41% to $106.3 million. Cloud revenue, which includes both Dayforce and Powerpay, increased by $33.5 million or 36% to $127.8 million. And total revenue, which includes revenue from both our Cloud and Bureau solutions, increased by $21.8 million or 14% to $179.3 million.
 During our last call, we provided guidance for the second quarter, and I'm pleased to report that our actual results for Cloud revenue exceeded the high end of the range by $2.8 million. Our actual results for total revenue exceeded the high end of the range by $4.3 million, and our actual results for adjusted EBITDA exceeded the high end of the range by $4.6 million.
 Cloud revenue growth in the second quarter was driven by a 35% increase in Cloud recurring services revenue and a 40% increase in Cloud professional services and other revenue. Of the $33.5 million increase in Cloud revenue, $6.1 million or 18% was attributable to Bureau customers migrating to Dayforce. Excluding the impact of migrations to Dayforce, revenue from Bureau solutions declined by $5.6 million or 8.9%, which was in line with our expectations.
 Cloud revenue accounted for 71% of our total revenue in the second quarter this year compared to 60% in the second quarter last year. Breaking down our Cloud revenue by solution, during the second quarter, Dayforce revenue increased 41% to $106.3 million, and Powerpay revenue increased 13% to $21.5 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, Dayforce revenue increased approximately 40%, Powerpay revenue increased by 8% and Cloud revenue increased by 33%.
 The average float balance for our customer trust funds during the second quarter was approximately $3.35 billion compared to $3.23 billion in the second quarter last year. And the average yield was 1.94% during the second quarter, an increase of 55 basis points compared to the average yield in the second quarter last year. As a result, income from invested customer trust funds was $16.2 million in the second quarter compared to $11.2 million in the second quarter last year.
 While Cloud recurring services revenue grew 35%, our cost of Cloud recurring services to support this growth increased by $3.9 million or 13%. And our gross margin on Cloud recurring services increased from 62% in the second quarter last year to 68% as we continue to scale the business.
 While professional services and other revenue grew 36%, cost of professional services and other revenue was reduced by $0.7 million or 2%, primarily due to productivity improvements in implementing new customers, reflecting the increased experience of our implementation consultants and the continued use of automation in our implementation processes. Continuing the trend from last quarter, our negative margin on professional services and other revenue improved from negative 104% in the second quarter last year to negative 47%, reflecting an increase in profitable post go-live professional services and productivity improvements in implementing new customers.
 Product development and management expenses increased by $5.1 million or 51% to $15.1 million, primarily due to increased research and development costs, and capitalized software development costs were relatively flat year-over-year. Overall, we generated a $21.8 million increase in total revenue, with a $6.7 million increase in total cost of revenues. And gross profit increased by $15.1 million or 26% to $72.8 million.
 Selling, general and administrative expense increased $29.3 million to $84.1 million. Of the $29.3 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, $23.2 million was attributable to onetime expenses related to the IPO and debt refinancing. Excluding IPO-related expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $6.1 million, primarily due to increased sales commission expense, employee benefit-related costs and incremental costs associated with being a public company.
 We incurred an operating loss of $11.3 million in the second quarter compared to operating profit of $0.9 million in the second quarter last year. Excluding the impact of $25.3 million in IPO and debt refinancing expenses, we would have realized an operating profit of $14 million in the second quarter compared to an operating profit of $0.9 million in the second quarter last year.
 Adjusted EBITDA increased to $33.6 million from $22.6 million last year. Interest expense increased by $21.4 million, reflecting $25.7 million in interest expense related to the redemption of the senior notes and refinancing of our term loan debt. 
 Income tax expense was reduced by $0.8 million. And net loss attributable to Ceridian increased by $42.6 million to a net loss of $65.5 million compared to a net loss of $22.9 million in the second quarter last year. Excluding the impact of $51 million in IPO and debt refinancing expenses and assuming no change in tax expense, net loss would have been $14.5 million compared to a net loss of $22.9 million in the second quarter last year.
 As discussed in our Form 10-Q filing, beginning in the first quarter of 2019, we plan to adopt the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606. To facilitate comparisons with companies that may have already adopted, we have estimated the impact of new standard -- that the new standard will have on our financial results and have disclosed these in our Form 10-Q. We expect that adoption of the new standard will result in changes to the classification and timing of our revenue recognition. 
 Specifically, we expect an increase in revenue classified as professional services and other revenue and a reduction in revenue classified as recurring services revenue under the new standard as compared to current U.S. GAAP. Further, we expect that the new standard will result in changes to the timing of our revenue recognition compared to current U.S. GAAP. We also expect changes to the timing of certain incremental selling, general and administrative expenses, as the new standard will require capitalizing and amortizing certain selling expenses, such as commissions and bonuses paid to the sales force. These sales expenses will be amortized over the customer's period of benefit.
 Under the new standard, in Q2 2018, professional services and other revenue would have increased by $5.7 million, recurring services revenue would have been reduced by $5.3 million, so total revenue would have increased by $0.4 million. In addition, sales expenses would have been reduced by $2.8 million, resulting in an increase in operating profit of $3.2 million. The margin on professional services and other would have improved from negative 47% to negative 18%, and the gross margin on Cloud recurring services would have been reduced from 68% to 66%.
 Moving to the balance sheet. As of June 30, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $171.8 million, an increase of $77.6 million compared to December 31, 2017. And our total debt was $671.5 million as of June 30, 2018, a reduction of $448.3 million compared to the balance of December 31, 2017. The $77.6 million increase in cash and the $448.3 million reduction in debt are primarily attributable to the IPO and refinancing of our term debt.
 Our capital expenditures through the first 6 months of 2018 were $18.8 million compared to $19.2 million through the first 6 months last year. Included in the $18.8 million in capital expenditures were $13.9 million for software and technology and $4.9 million for property and equipment.
 Turning now to our outlook for the third quarter. We expect Cloud revenue in the range of $129 million to $131 million, total revenue to be in the range of $175 million to $177 million and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $30 million to $32 million. Our outlook for the third quarter also includes the following assumptions: Interest expense of approximately $10 million and approximately 138 million weighted average shares outstanding.
 Turning now to our outlook for the full year fiscal 2018. Our performance through the first half of the year provides us with the confidence to raise our full year fiscal 2018 outlook as follows. Cloud revenue is now expected to be in the range of $526 million to $530 million. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $735 million to $740 million. And as David discussed, given our over-performance in the second quarter, we believe that we can accelerate some of our investments and growth initiatives and still meet our profitability targets, and we are reaffirming our outlook for adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $148 million to $152 million.
 Our outlook for the full year fiscal 2018 also includes the following assumptions: Interest expense of approximately $86 million and approximately 114 million weighted average shares outstanding.
 I would also note that our guidance for both Q3 and the full year assumes no significant changes in foreign exchange rates.
 At this time, I'm going to ask the operator to open up the lines for any questions that you may have. Thank you. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jesse Hulsing with Goldman Sachs. 
Jesse Hulsing: David, the U.K. launch at the end of July, how did the launch go versus your expectations? And I guess, how do you think about that geography starting to contribute to revenue over the next couple of years? 
David Ossip: Jesse, nice to speak with you. The launch was fantastic. We're delighted with the initial go-live of the first few customers. In fact, I will be in the U.K. in early September for one of the customer's go-live celebrations. So it appears that they are very happy as well. As I mentioned, we have accelerated some of our HCM summits. We're having one in the U.K. right after Labor Day. And I also mentioned that we've started to increase across sales and marketing, specifically business development executives. These are the people who do the outbound calling to identify opportunities, and we're actively ramping up that team currently in the U.K. And alongside that, we're hiring sellers in the U.K. In terms of how it'll impact revenue, in 2018 and early 2019, it will be minimal. As you can imagine, we have to go through the sales cycle, do the implementations and then activate the accounts. So I would expect to see some impact towards the latter half of next year and into 2020. 
Jesse Hulsing: Great. And Arthur, Cloud recurring revenue was down a little bit quarter-over-quarter. Can you walk through what drove that? 
Arthur Gitajn: Yes, so first of all, Cloud recurring revenue increased year-over-year by $27.2 million or about 35%. As you noted, it was relatively flat sequentially quarter-to-quarter. It was relatively flat last year as well, and it's because there's some seasonality in our revenue. Q1 and Q4 are typically our strongest quarters, as Q1 benefits primarily from tax filing revenue earned in association with W-2 tax forms in the U.S. and also T4 tax forms in Canada. I would point out that Q2 Cloud revenue exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $2.8 million. Professional services and other revenue was $22.1 million, an increase of about 40%. Even if you attribute all of that over-performance to PS and other and subtract the $2.8 million from the $22 million, then our PS and other growth rate would have been roughly half, but we still would have hit the high end of our guidance range. So you can infer that Cloud recurring revenue was in line with our expectations. I would also point out that what we're seeing in this quarter's results and the overall trend that we expect to see reflected in the full year numbers, is that as the customer base matures, and you can see this on Page 31 of the 10-Q, the proportion of our customer base that's been live for more than 2 years has gone from 50% in Q2 2 years ago to 57% in Q2 last year to 61% in the second quarter this year. As the customer base matures, we have the opportunity to go back into our customer base and sell post go-live professional services and additional functionality. And the post go-live services are more profitable than the initial implementation services, and that's contributed to improvement in our margins on PS and other, which have improved from negative 104% to negative 47%. And the incremental hosting and customer support costs when customers buy additional modules is much less, and that contributes to the improvement in gross margin on Cloud recurring services, which increased from 61.5% to 67.7%. And you can also see this reflected in revenue per customer. The average revenue per customer added in Q2 was more than $50,000 compared to the average revenue per customer for all Dayforce customers, which was about $32,000. We believe Dayforce revenue per customer will continue to increase, not only as we continue to attract larger customers, but also as we sell additional functionality into our customer base. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. 
Mark Murphy: Yes, I was curious if you can ballpark the number of new Dayforce customers that were booked during the quarter and how that volume compares to Q2 of last year? I'm also just wondering how that number would compare to the number of Dayforce customers who went live, which I believe was 154, in Q2. 
David Ossip: Mark, thanks for the question. We don't report out the number of accounts that we sold in a given quarter. We'll take it under consideration for future quarters. What I can say is we do see a very robust market. 
Mark Murphy: Okay, great. And as a follow-up, David, how aggressive are your global payroll aspirations? For instance, what cadence do you think you can expect to roll out native payroll in new countries? And how many countries do you plan to offer in the very long run? 
David Ossip: So Mark, we've announced that we're accelerating Australia, which will be ready in early 2019. There are adjunct markets to both the U.K., such as Ireland and New Zealand, in Australia, which obviously would make a lot of sense. We also have quite an elaborate global strategy that we're now beginning to operationalize. And as we get further along, we'll begin to share a bit more information. 
Mark Murphy: Okay. One last question, David. If you look at the Dayforce wins during Q2, is there any way you can approximate what mix of the customers selected Dayforce over the competition primarily because of the continuous payroll calculation engine versus any other attributes, for instance, the -- just the overarching architecture with the single application, single database, et cetera? 
David Ossip: Mark, we've spoken about this beforehand, we are differentiated in that we are a single application, meaning one database, one user experience and one rule engine, and that allows us to do the continuous calculation, which, as you probably have researched, does differentiate us from the other players inside the market. Generally, it is one of the top reasons that clients select us. That 5,000-employee mortgage company that I spoke about out of Chicago, that would have been their reason for selecting us. And I would imagine that it probably holds true for the other customer wins we had in the quarter. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray. 
Aleksandr Zukin: So I guess, maybe the first one for David. As you think about the increase in the incremental investments that you're making on sales and marketing, can you maybe talk about what you're seeing from either a new ARR bookings perspective in the first half that's giving you the confidence to make these investments and maybe how that compares to first half of last year? 
David Ossip: Sure. Nice to speak with you, Alex. As I mentioned, we're seeing a robust market. And in prior conversations, I have spoken about that we would not hire ahead of market demand. So the fact that you can see us investing in sales and marketing probably is indicative that we do see a very strong market and strong demand for our types of services. 
Aleksandr Zukin: That's helpful. And then maybe one for Arthur. Can you talk about Powerpay? Sequentially, both this year and last year, it can be down on a sequential basis. So I'm just curious, what drives that usually? And how should we think about any seasonality in the back half of the year on either Dayforce or Powerpay? 
Arthur Gitajn: The big impact on Powerpay is foreign exchange. The stronger Canadian dollar positively impacted the Powerpay growth rate. Since Powerpay is exclusively a Canadian product and the Canadian dollar strengthened by 4% from CAD 1.34 to USD 1 in Q2 last year to about CAD 1.29 in Q2 this year, Powerpay revenue grew 8.1% on a constant-currency basis compared to 13.2% on a GAAP basis. 
Aleksandr Zukin: Perfect. And if I could just sneak one more in on Dayforce. Can you comment on the quantity and kind of volume and success of converting Bureau customers to Dayforce during the quarter? How did that trend relative to last year? And maybe what do you expect that to look like during the remainder of the year? 
Arthur Gitajn: Again, we saw a contribution -- the migration of Bureau customers to Dayforce was approximately 18% in -- contributed approximately 18% of the increase in Cloud revenue. We've been guiding to about 15% to 20%, and historically, we've seen about 25%. Important to note that even as the impact of migrations declines, we continue to see solid Cloud revenue growth and Dayforce growth, which even on a constant-currency basis, Dayforce grew 40%. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. 
Karl Keirstead: Just a follow-up on the decision to increase the investment in the second half. Perhaps for David or Arthur, whoever wants to take it, I'm just curious whether you view this as a relatively sort of onetime step-up? Or would you expect the level of investment spending in sales capacity build-out to perhaps continue into 2019, such that we should temper our expectations around the growth in adjusted EBITDA margins? 
David Ossip: So nice question. As Arthur had mentioned, we have increased our revenue guidance, but we've held steady with our EBITDA guidance for the remainder of the year. The fact that we came in above the EBITDA guidance in Q2 can be used to kind of infer what the investment would be in terms of growth initiatives for the remainder of the year. Going into next year, I imagine that we will continue to invest in the growth of the business. 
Karl Keirstead: Okay. And then maybe a follow-up for me. You've given, obviously, the Dayforce customer count and the sequential growth. I'm just wondering whether there were any notable mix shifts in terms of enterprise, mid-market, smaller customers, David, worth flagging for us. 
David Ossip: I would say it's rather constant with prior quarters. We are seeing success across all of the different segments. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi with Wells Fargo. 
Sitikantha Panigrahi: I just want to dig a little bit more on that investment on sales and marketing. Would you be able to share your maybe areas of investment, whether it's more on the Dayforce side or Powerpay or the international market? And like how -- what's your aspiration in terms of quota-carrying sales rep increase for there versus what you plan to achieve? 
David Ossip: Sure. The investments that we're making are predominantly on the Dayforce side, just given that the majority of our Cloud revenue is Dayforce. However, we are making investments on the Powerpay side. The Powerpay investments are largely around developing more broker relationships, more marketing to get more inbound leads and as well as to increase the headcount slightly in the outbound sellers. Remember that a Powerpay seller is quite different than a Dayforce seller in that those -- these are mostly telesale types of agreements. In terms of the investments that we're making in Dayforce, there are a number. The first piece is we've increased the number of HCM summits that we're doing this year, and I would expect that number to continue growing as we go into next year. These are the 1.5-day events that we typically have, where we bring in prospective customers to a particular location and we have existing customers speak about why they selected us and what their experience has been working with Ceridian, what the implementation was like and what the benefits they've received from the system. And we've been quite successful. The Chicago mortgage company that I spoke about was the output of the Denver summit that we had earlier inside the year. We also are making investments in BDEs. These are the outbound callers who call into organizations to identify active opportunities for HR, payroll, time and attendance, all various HCM types of modules. We are increasing the number of quota-carrying reps, although we did not disclose to the market the number of reps that we have. And as well, we are investing in sales and market -- sorry, we are investing in marketing and alliance programs to obviously also increase the pipeline. 
Sitikantha Panigrahi: And just a follow-up to Powerpay. How big is that opportunity? And what's your penetration at this point? I guess that's only focused on Canada. And also, are you planning to ever bring Powerpay or even Dayforce to U.S. at least to target 500 and below market? 
David Ossip: So I didn't hear the first part of your question, but in regards to the second part of your question, the Dayforce technology does scale both up and down market. In fact, in Canada, we do see some small market wins with customers below 500. We are looking at new implementation tooling and methodologies that could make the Dayforce implementations very attractive for the smaller market in the U.S. as well. However, we haven't made any decisions on that at this point in time. Could you repeat the first part of your question? 
Sitikantha Panigrahi: Yes, I was asking how big is the opportunity still remain in Canada. And what's your penetration at this point for Powerpay? 
David Ossip: We -- our biggest competitor for Powerpay is really boxed software, so there's still a tremendous amount of opportunity for Powerpay in Canada. I had talked about this a little bit earlier in the year. In the last number of years, we effectively have taken our -- what at the time was a limited marketing and sales expense and targeted at Dayforce, as we were building up the business. Now that we have a slightly different balance sheet, we are looking at opportunities to accelerate sales for Powerpay in Canada. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird. 
Mark Marcon: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the incremental clients that you ended up bringing on to Dayforce. Clearly, they are larger in size in terms of the revenue spend. And I'm wondering if you could dimensionalize that, either in terms of size of clients or number of modules that are brought on. And also, what were you seeing in terms of the competitor takeaways? And staying on Dayforce, obviously, Q2 is not a big turnover period, but just any sort of commentary with regards to client retention? 
David Ossip: Sure, Mark. A lot of questions inside there. We haven't really broken out the segment of the customers that we've onboarded within the last quarter. I would expect that they are somewhat consistent to what we've seen previously. In terms of success rates, I mentioned before we're having success across segments. Our competitiveness of the product that's differentiated by the continuous calc and the single app is still resonating very well inside the market, and that has allowed us to have many competitive wins. The account in Chicago that I spoke about was a very, very competitive sales process, where we did replace one of our primary competitors. 
Arthur Gitajn: Mark, with respect to retention rates, we're only providing those annually, and our Cloud retention rate last year was 97%. We went into the year planning between 95% and 97%, and at this point, we don't see anything that would cause us to rethink those numbers. 
Mark Marcon: Great. And then I was wondering if you could just -- there was an earlier question just about the step-up with regards to the investments for this year and implications as it relates to EBITDA margin expansion for next year, and I wasn't entirely clear in terms of the answer. And I was just wondering, should we continue to expect the margin expansion pace beyond this year that was previously outlined? 
Arthur Gitajn: We're still in the very early stages of planning for next year and beyond. As David's talked about, there is a time lag between investment and when you realize it in revenue, and we want to balance that. But we -- we want to balance the investment and -- but we also see very positive trends in terms of margin expansion. Again, the sale of additional functionality to our existing base and incremental additional modules and the maturity of the customer base, so it's going to be a combination of sort of those 2 factors. But more to come, quarterly, as we continue to develop our plans for next year and beyond, we'll share more in subsequent quarters. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. 
Walter Pritchard: Wondering, I guess, for David, on the Dayforce live customer count, that's been decelerating a bit here. I'm wondering, as we look towards the end of the year, given the investments you're making in sales and marketing, should we expect that, that go-live customer count accelerates off of the Q2 levels that we saw in terms of growth year-over-year? 
David Ossip: So a couple of things over there. We have been going upmarket. So if you go year-over-year comparisons and such, there is a slight difference that there are larger accounts going live as opposed to lots of smaller accounts going live. Q4 in terms of go live is obviously our biggest, and I would expect to see a healthy number of customers going live in Q4. 
Walter Pritchard: Got it. And then just maybe for Arthur. On the pro serv side, in terms of just -- it seems like we've got a bit of systematic upside to that business over the last couple of quarters. How much of that is the post-implementation services versus any leading indicator of implementation-type activity that's going on that may result in go-lives here in the next few quarters? 
Arthur Gitajn: It's primarily the -- a larger proportion of the post go-live professional services. That's what's primarily driving the increase in the overall margin. 
David Ossip: So if you actually look at the numbers, we -- the post live service revenue as a percentage of total professional services and other revenue increased from 22% to 29% Q2 to Q2, and that's obviously driving the increase in the margin of that particular group. 
Walter Pritchard: Great. And then just lastly, on the additional investments, they've been talked about quite a bit here, but just help us understand domestic versus international split of that incremental investment, if you could. 
David Ossip: The majority of it is still in North America. However, we are beginning now to ramp up BDE, sales and marketing in both the U.K. and in Australia. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies. 
John DiFucci: I have a question for David and a follow-up for Arthur. David, regarding the executive team changes, you said that Paul is going to serve as COO until May of 2019 and -- while Leagh Turner is going to take over as President. I guess, just to be clear, is Paul going to remain with the company after May of 2019? And then also, the new CSO role for Erik Zimmer, just curious as to what areas of the company's strategy he's going to be first focused on? 
David Ossip: Great. So those are a few great questions. So the first thing is I'm delighted both that Leagh and Erik are joining the company. We've obviously taken advantage of the IPO to, what I would say, level up the organization. Leagh joins us from SAP, where she most recently was COO of Global Strategic Accounts. And prior to that, she served as COO of EMEA as well as Canada for SAP. She was acting President of Canada for a while. Leagh is exceptionally strong on the growth side. So in terms of sales, marketing, alliances and strategies around that, she has significant experiences in both running large successful sales organizations as well as a lot of experience on the global side. Erik joins us from Thomas Lee. I've worked with Erik now for at least 7 years. Erik was an MD in their operational group, and he and I worked very closely together on the Activate technology that was very successful in terms of reducing cycle times and effort hours for implementation. Erik's responsibilities will be to focus on, if you like, strategic areas of growth for the business. So looking for ways to accelerate the Powerpay business, looking at ways that we can make the global organizations more comprehensive and more robust, with higher levels of services for the organization, looking at various types of biz dev and corp dev activities as well as helping generally across the organization, similar to what he was doing from T.H. Lee in terms of operational excellence. In terms of Paul, Paul has been a fantastic person to work with over the last number of years. Paul will be transitioning into a consulting role post May of 2019, so it's a very gradual transfer. And he will be active in that type of role for around another year. The details of all of the executive changes are on the 8-K that we filed last night. 
John DiFucci: Great. And Arthur, just a clarification to, I think the question has been asked a few times, just about the sequential decline in Cloud recurring revenue. But I'm pretty sure that's primarily due to the seasonal onetime revenue you get in the first quarter for Powerpay, which Powerpay almost -- I guess, last year, it actually grew, but the recurring part of Powerpay usually declines in the second quarter almost every year, and I think that has the biggest effect here. Isn't that correct? You still have a lot of things there, but I think that's the main thing. 
Arthur Gitajn: That is the main thing. There's a little bit of additional Dayforce revenue as well, but you're right. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Justin Furby with William Blair. 
Justin Furby: David, just to start, can you give a sense for what PEPM looks like today for new deals on the Dayforce side and maybe how that compares a year ago? And if you sold everything to a customer before discounting, what does that opportunity look like? 
David Ossip: So I can answer in broad terms, because we haven't disclosed what the average PEPM is or what the target PEPM is. Obviously, the number is going up as we increase the number of modules that are available to the clients. We also typically sell the full suite when we are in the mid-market, which for us is between around 700 employees and a few thousand employees. And as we're getting more and more success in that particular range, obviously, the average PEPM is going up in that series. In terms of product investments, I mentioned that we are accelerating some of the R&D side. At INSIGHTS this year, which is in October, which is our client conference, we'll be showing success -- or sorry, succession management as well as on-demand pay, both of which will add to the platform. 
Justin Furby: Okay, got it. And then just a pretty hypothetical question, but if you think about your growth investments on the sales side, if there's 100 deals in play in any given quarter, which, hopefully, the number's a lot higher, but on the payroll side, in the Dayforce market, like how many of those do you think Dayforce is being considered in? What percentage of those opportunities in the mid-market, enterprise, are you being considered in? And where do you think that could go over time? 
David Ossip: I don't have an answer for that. I do believe there are deals that we do not see. And obviously, increasing sales and marketing expenses across the board will allow us to play at more -- to have more at-bats. As we know that our win rates are quite healthy, we're quite confident that by making those investments, we should see growth. 
Justin Furby: Okay, got it. And then just, Arthur, a housekeeping item. The $5 million or so under 606 that would get reclassified from recurring into services, can you give us a sense of what that revenue consists of or what sort of revenue that is? 
Arthur Gitajn: Well, basically, what we're doing under 606 is you take the fee for the entire arrangement and then you allocate it as between the elements. And the elements here are primarily the PEPM recurring revenue and the professional services and other. Professional services -- so on PEPM, we're deemed to have stand-alone sales price of whatever we sell it; on the services, not. And so really, it's the -- you're allocating from PEPM -- from the recurring revenue to services, based on estimated stand-alone sales price. 
Operator: Mr. Ossip, there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the floor back to you for any final comments. 
David Ossip: Well, thank you very much. In closing, we are pleased with our strong performance in the second quarter and our continued positive momentum into the third quarter, which has allowed us to increase our revenue outlook for the year and to accelerate investments in growth initiatives. We remain dedicated to building and to delivering innovative technology that helps make work life better for our customers and their employees. 
 I would like to thank everyone again for your interest in Ceridian and joining us for the call today. Thank you. 
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2018 Q1  (2018-05-22 00:00:00) =====

Finally, all figures discussed on this conference call are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted. 
 With that, I will turn the call over to David. 
David Ossip: Thanks, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Ceridian's first earnings call as a public company following our successful initial public offering in April 2018. Our listing on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange was a significant milestone for Ceridian, and we are very pleased to take this important step in growing our company.
 I'm pleased with our strong performance in the first quarter, where we achieved Cloud revenue growth of 38% in the HCM adjusted, EBITDA growth of 39.7%, which drove 470 basis point improvement in our HCM adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.3%. In addition, we continue to see strong market demand for Dayforce, our flagship cloud human capital management, or HCM, platform. We had 3,154 customers live on the Dayforce platform at the end of the first quarter, an increase of 150 customers from the fourth quarter of 2017 and an increase of 674 customers from the same date last year. In short, we're off to a strong start to 2018.
 Also, we'll review our financial results in greater detail, but first, I'm going to spend a few minutes to recap the Ceridian transformation so new investors and our analysts can better understand the key drivers for Ceridian's growth and strong financial results.
 In 2009, I looked at reentering the human capital management market. And what I saw at that time was that there had been a shift from on-premise solutions to cloud, and I looked to use that change in technology as a way to enter the market. When I looked at the market, my first observation was that the human capital management market was very large, around $20 billion, with cloud payroll being about 25% of that market. And when I looked particularly at the cloud payroll market, it was -- a few things stood out.
 First, the requirements across customer, regardless of industry or size, appeared to be the same. And that meant, from a cloud perspective, that we could build an application that will not require any customizations and could be deployed with a single code base on a single instance, which is very important from a cloud perspective.
 My second observation was that the average life of a customer for any of the payroll vendors seemed to be above 10 years. And that, from a cloud perspective, meant that there would be a very long life of customer and very attractive lifetime value for each customer relationship.
 My third observation was that there seem to be a requirement in the market for vendor consolidation, particularly that the customers wanted to have recruiting, performance, compensation functionality and other on top of their core HR, payroll and time applications.
 To me, these appear to be very attractive for building a cloud company. So my question was, is there a tangent that I could use to enter the market by solving a persistent problem for customers that was not being addressed by the incumbent payroll providers? I did a lot of observation of payroll people, had a number of conversations, and what I observed was that the general workflow used by payroll people was not optimal.
 What was going on was that there was a separation between time systems and payroll systems, time being where people would clock in and clock out, and payroll being where the taxes and the withholding calculations would happen. And the payroll data would effectively be stuck in the time system for the duration of the pay period, which was typically a 1-week or 2-week period. And so what would go on is that the people would clock in, clock out. The data would remain in the payroll system. The payroll people wouldn't be able to access it until typically a day after the pay period ended, and then they would have a very short period of time to do all of their quality checks, adjustment entries and all of their reconciliations that were needed to pay people accurately. And what resonated the most was when payroll people said they committed pay when they ran out of time rather than when they were ready.
 The solution to me was to build a new system that would combine payroll benefits and time with a continuous calculation. What that meant was that any time an HR record would change, a benefit record would change, a time record would change, you would recalculate the net earnings immediately. And by doing that, you could allow the payroll people to get access to the data throughout the payroll period, make any of the necessary adjustments, do all of their required audits, and that would obviously increase the accuracy of pay, reduce the anxiety for the payroll team, increase compliance. And you could also make that information available to employees so that they could see their earnings statements during the after pay period, to managers and CFOs so they could use that data for general business purposes.
 The idea was that we would enter the market with this differentiated solution with continuous calculations, and we would use that to win customers. And once we have the customer, we would expand the platform into all the different talent applications such as recruiting, onboarding, performance management, compensation management and learning. And the idea would be that we will be able to increase the recurring revenue from the clients without materially changing the cost basis of the actual account.
 In 2011, I had approached the owners of Ceridian with the concept of merging Ceridian and Dayforce together. And the reason that I wanted to partner with Ceridian was that in order to do payroll, you require very comprehensive tax. And tax, while the calculations themselves are not necessarily difficult, it does require a tremendous amount of knowledge from all of the tens of thousands of jurisdictions across the United States. And Ceridian had very strong best-of-class tax capabilities. The second reason that I wanted to partner with Ceridian was that I had been a Ceridian customer, and I had, had a very pleasant experience working with Ceridian. And I felt that their service organization was quite strong.
 The partnership completed in 2012 with the acquisition of Dayforce, and at that point, I took over the organization. We had 3 priorities following the combination. The first priority was that we were going to complete the Dayforce platform. The second priority that we had was that we were going to change the culture of the organization. And our belief was that if we could have a leading culture, that will translate into better customer relationships, higher referenceability and in-growth. And our third priority was that we were going to simplify the business by effectively divesting all areas of Ceridian that were not central to the growth of our cloud human capital management business.
 I am proud that we have accomplished much on all of those 3 priorities. We have simplified the business to the point that we now sell only our flagship Dayforce product and our leading Powerpay product, which is a cloud HR and payroll solution for the Canadian small business market.
 On the second priority, we have a winning culture. Our brand promise is to make work life better for anyone who uses our products and services, and that has become the focus of driving a culture of innovation and getting very high employee engagement, which has led to very high customer retention rates and new customer referrals. In fact, on Dayforce, our retention rate has been about 97% in 2017. In 2017, we're also very honored to receive over 20 awards, alone, recognizing our culture, including Glassdoor's Top 100 Best Places to Work.
 And on the platform side, we have built a very comprehensive end-to-end platform for human capital management. We have over 3,150 clients live on the Dayforce platform. And we have been successful across all areas of industry, industries such as financial services, retail, consumer product group, manufacturing, health care and human sciences and others.
 From a growth perspective going forward, we have 6 key initiatives. First, we'll continue to grow doing exactly what we have done over the last number of years. We believe that the HCM market is massive, and we still have a significant opportunity to increase our penetration in North America. The second initiative is to expand globally. We have built Dayforce as a global platform, and we are now adding a native payroll functionality in select countries. We currently have the ability to do native payroll in the U.S., Canada and the U.K., and we will be releasing in other countries in the upcoming years. Our third initiative is to continue selling the talent modules that we have already built to customers that are already live on the Dayforce platform. Our fourth initiative is to continue to innovate and to continue building new modules that we can take to our customers to provide additional value and to drive additional revenue for us. Our fifth initiative is to continue to grow our partner ecosystem. And finally, our sixth initiative is to take advantage of our continuous pay calculation capability and to bring that to our customers to provide them with on-demand pay, which would allow their employees to effectively cash out during an active payroll cycle to get paid for the days that they have worked. And we can also take advantage of the rise of the gig economy, which effectively would allow for the same-day onboarding and same-day payments for the flexible workers.
 I would now like to turn over the call to Arthur to discuss our financial results and guidance. 
Arthur Gitajn: Thank you, David, and hello, everybody. As of March 31, we had 2 operating and reportable segments: our human capital management, or HCM, segment; and Lifeworks. The HCM segment includes both of our cloud solutions, Dayforce and Powerpay as well as our Bureau solutions. Our Lifeworks segment reflects the results of our Lifeworks joint venture.
 Subsequent to the first quarter on April 30, we successfully completed our initial public offering. And at the same time, we distributed our interest in Lifeworks to our pre-IPO stockholders. So beginning with our second quarter, Lifeworks will no longer be reported as a segment of our business, and historical Lifeworks results will be reclassified and presented as discontinued operations.
 As David mentioned, we're very pleased with our performance in the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. Dayforce revenue increased by $31.4 million or 44% to $102.4 million. Cloud revenue, which includes both Dayforce and Powerpay, increased by $34.5 million or 38% to a $125.2 million. And total HCM revenue, which includes revenue from both our Cloud and Bureau solutions, increased by $19.8 million or 12% to a $187.2 million. Total revenue, which includes revenue from both our HCM and Lifeworks segments, increased by $21.9 million or 12% to $208.9 million.
 We have 2 categories of revenues, recurring services revenues and professional services and other revenues, which are nonrecurring. Cloud recurring services revenue consists primarily of per employee per month subscription charges, and professional services and other revenues consist primarily of charges relating to Dayforce implementations but also include post-go-live professional services.
 Cloud revenue growth in the first quarter was driven by a 39% increase in Cloud recurring services revenue and a 34% increase in Cloud professional services and other revenue. Of the $34.5 million increase in total Cloud revenue, $6.1 million or 18% was attributable to Bureau customers migrating to Dayforce. Excluding the impact of migrations to Dayforce, revenue from Bureau solutions, which we generally stopped selling in 2012, declined by $8.6 million or 11.2%, which was in line with our expectations. Cloud revenue accounted for 67% of our total HCM revenue in the first quarter this year compared to 54% in the first quarter last year.
 Breaking down our Cloud revenue by solution, during the first quarter, Dayforce revenue increased 44% to a $102.4 million, and Powerpay revenue increased 16% to $22.8 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, Dayforce revenue increased 43%, and revenue from Powerpay, our Cloud solution for small businesses in Canada, increased by 10%.
 The average float balance for our customer cross-funds during the first quarter was approximately $4.1 billion compared to $3.8 billion in the first quarter last year. And the average yield was 1.75% during the first quarter, an increase of 52 basis points compared to the first quarter last year. As a result, income from invested customer cross-funds was $17.6 million in the first quarter compared to a $11.4 million in the first quarter last year.
 While Cloud recurring services revenue grew 39%, our cost of Cloud recurring services to support this growth increased by $4.2 million or 15%, and our gross margin on Cloud recurring services increased from 62% in the first quarter last year to 69% as we continue to scale the business. While professional services and other revenue grew 29%, cost of professional services and other revenue was reduced by $1.1 million or 3%, primarily due to productivity improvements in implementing new customers, reflecting the increased experience of our implementation consultants and the continued use of automation in our implementation processes.
 Continuing the trend from last year, our negative margin on professional services and other revenue improved from negative 117% in the first quarter last year to negative 62%, reflecting, in addition to productivity improvements, an increase in profitable post-go-live professional services as a proportion of professional services and other revenue.
 Product development and management expenses increased by $2.6 million or 20% to $15.4 million, and capitalized software development costs increased by 13% from $5.4 million in the first quarter last year to $6.1 million. Excluding Lifeworks, HCM product development and management expenses increased by $2.9 million or 27% to $13.7 million.
 Overall, gross profit increased by $15.4 million or 21% to $89.2 million. Excluding Lifeworks, HCM gross profit increased by $15.5 million or 24% to $81.3 million as we continue to leverage our investment in people and processes to realize economies of scale.
 Selling, general and administrative expense increased $4.9 million or 8% to $65.6 million. Excluding Lifeworks, HCM selling, general and administrative expense increased $3 million or 6% to $56.8 million, primarily due to an increase in HCM sales and marketing expense, partially offset by a reduction in other general and administrative expenses.
 HCM operating profit increased to $27.3 million from $10.9 million in the first quarter last year, and HCM adjusted EBITDA increased to $43.6 million from $31.2 million last year. Net loss attributable to Ceridian improved by $9.1 million to a net loss of $2.1 million compared to a net loss of $11.2 million in the first quarter last year. As of March 31, we had cash and cash equivalents of $62.2 million, and our total debt was $1,132,000,000. Our capital expenditures in the first quarter were $10.3 million, including $7.4 million for software and technology and $2.9 million for property and equipment.
 Subsequent to the first quarter, on April 30, 2018, we successfully completed our initial public offering of 21 million shares of common stock at a public offering price of $22 per share to raise $462 million in primary proceeds. Subsequent to the closing of our IPO on April 30, THL/Cannae Investors LLC purchased from us in a private placement a $100 million of our common stock at a price per share equal to the IPO price. Including the exercise of the underwriters' overallotment option, the total offering was 24.15 million shares of common stock, with gross proceeds of $631.3 million when combined with the private placement.
 Concurrently, with the closing of the IPO and the private placement, we applied a portion of the net proceeds to satisfy and to discharge the $475 million principal amount of our outstanding 11% senior notes, and they will be redeemed on May 30, 2018. We also refinanced our remaining indebtedness under our $702 million senior term debt and a $130 million revolving credit facility, including accrued interests and related costs and expenses, with new senior credit facilities consisting of a $680 million term loan debt facility and a $300 million revolving credit facility.
 As I mentioned, contemporaneously with the IPO and private placement, we distributed our interest in Lifeworks to our pre-IPO stockholders on a pro rata basis in accordance with the pro rata interest in U.S. Consequently, we no longer have any material obligations under the Lifeworks joint venture agreement. Lifeworks is no longer a separate segment, and we will no longer have a noncontrolling interest in Lifeworks on our consolidated financial statements.
 Turning now to our outlook for the second quarter and full year fiscal 2018. For the second quarter, we expect Cloud revenue in the range of a $123 million to $125 million, total HCM revenue to be in the range of a $173 million to $175 million and HCM adjusted EBITDA in the range of $27 million to $29 million. Our outlook for the second quarter also includes the following assumptions: interest expense of approximately $41 million and 113.1 million weighted average shares outstanding.
 It's also important to note, since this is our first time providing guidance as a public company, there is some seasonality in our business. Q1 and Q4 are our strongest quarters. Q1 benefits primarily from tax filing revenue earned in association with W-2 tax forms in the U.S. and T4 tax forms in Canada and higher post-go-live professional services revenue related to the year-end activities of our customers. Q4 also benefits from seasonality where we earn revenue on certain year-end processes and higher cloud professional services revenue.
 For the full year fiscal 2018, we expect Cloud revenue to be in the range of $521 million to $524 million, total HCM revenue to be in the range of $730 million to $735 million and HCM adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of a $148 million to $152 million. Our outlook for full fiscal year 2018 also includes the following assumptions: interest expense of approximately $84 million and 113.7 million weighted average shares outstanding.
 I would also note that our guidance for both Q2 and the full year assumes no significant changes in our foreign exchange.
 To conclude my prepared remarks, I would say that our first -- that our results for the first quarter reflect the combination of revenue growth and increased profitability that, I believe, is one of the things that differentiates Ceridian from a financial perspective. Dayforce has transformed Ceridian into a fast-growing cloud business on a constant currency basis over the last 5 years. Cloud revenue has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 34%, and on a constant currency basis in the first quarter of this year, cloud revenue increased by 36%. At the same time, HCM gross profit increased by 24%, HCM operating profit more than doubled and HCM adjusted EBITDA increased by 40%.
 At this time, I'd ask the operator to open up the lines so that we can take any questions that you may have. Thank you. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray. 
Aleksandr Zukin: Congratulations on your first quarter out of the box here. Could you maybe quantify -- you talked about the success of converting some of the Bureau customers to Dayforce in the quarter. How was that trend relative to maybe this time last year? Maybe what should we expect as we look forward towards the remainder of the year? 
Arthur Gitajn: So historically, Bureau customers have accounted for approximately 25% of the increase in Cloud revenue. We would expect that to decline to the 15% to 20% range over the next 8 quarters. 
Aleksandr Zukin: Great. Great. And then Powerpay, that business seems like, by our math, grew in kind of the double-digit range in the first quarter, I think almost even accelerating from last year. Can you talk to what you're seeing out of that business? And maybe in terms of the guidance, how should we be thinking about Dayforce versus Powerpay revenue for the balance of the year? 
David Ossip: Alex, last year, we began to make some small investments in Powerpay. As you can recall, the Powerpay business is largely an outbound calling business where we make contact with an opportunity and try to convert it very, very quickly. We saw some yield from those investments as Powerpay grew year-over-year by 16% or 10% on an FX-adjusted basis. As we go forward, we will be making investments now in the growth of Powerpay. We'll probably speak a little bit more about this in the Q2 call as we currently are looking at all the various ways that we can look at investing in growth. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jesse Hulsing with Goldman Sachs. 
Jesse Hulsing: I have 2. You talked a bit about international expansion as being one of your core growth initiatives and having support for Canada and U.K. payroll. I'm wondering what you're thinking about for a distribution strategy. Is the plan to use partners as you expand internationally? Will you build out a direct sales force? And what should we think about with regards to timing of that? 
David Ossip: Nice to be speaking with you, Jesse. Just on global, as you said, we do now have native capabilities for Dayforce for the U.S., Canada and for the U.K. Proud to announce that we now have live customers in the U.K. using the Dayforce product. As we mentioned during the road show and before, we are currently building out additional native countries. Our go-to-market strategy in the countries will largely depend on which country. At the moment, we are using a direct sales model that is very similar to what we've done in North America. But depending on the country we go into, there may be more of a partnership strategy. In terms of timing, we also mentioned this before, it takes us about 9 months to build out a new payroll engine for a new country. And then we typically select a few customers to go live to get referenceability in that particular geography, and that's typically followed by the buildout of the business development executives who do the outbound calling to source the actual leads as well as the salespeople who do the conversion. So the time from making the decision to build out a new country until we release is about 9 months. It takes us probably about a 6 to 12 months to get the first customers live, followed by the buildout of the salespeople, and then we get the revenue. 
Jesse Hulsing: Got it. And then, Arthur, one for you. As you migrate Bureau customers to Dayforce, what impact, if any, does that have on float revenue? Does the time you're holding the funds change? Or does anything change there that would impact float? 
Arthur Gitajn: Generally, no, but it's important to note that our revenue will generally increase faster there afloat because the float is associated with payroll, payroll tax deposits. And when customers migrate from Bureau to Cloud solutions, they typically buy additional functionality on the HCM side of our offering. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. 
Mark Murphy: Yes, David, I'm wondering, in what percentage of your new wins was your continuous calculation engine being cited as a key swing factor that caused the customer to select Dayforce over the competition? And also, was it impactful to prospects that have salaried workers primarily rather than hourly workers? 
David Ossip: So that's an interesting question. I don't think we've ever quantified it by surveying the customers. However, from my opinion, I would say that our ability to do continuous calculations which, again, provides not only the payroll people, but the business people and the employees with access to real-time, fully costed payroll data usually is a differentiating factor and one of the reasons that clients select us. There are other reasons as well that I would point to. Typically, their client experience is typically very positive. Referenceability is quite high. And the platform, as you know, with the native capabilities in just one is a differentiator as well. 
Mark Murphy: Okay. And as a follow-up, could you comment on your upmarket traction in the quarter? For instance, how did you fare with the organizations that have, I think, over 6,000 employees as your line there for the enterprise? And then what was the size of the largest organization that selected Dayforce in the quarter? 
David Ossip: So we continue to see strong traction in the upper market, which is above 6,000. I don't believe we have disclosed, and Arthur can correct me if I'm wrong, the number of customers that we saw above 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 or 40,000, but we did see a traction in those markets. 
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. 
Karl Keirstead: And maybe one for David and one for Arthur. David, IPOs can sometimes be branding events, and I'm just curious whether you think your IPO has had any impact. I know it's only obviously been a month or so on Dayforce awareness in the U.S. market. Any early reaction that you can share? And then for Arthur. Arthur, you mentioned that HCM sales and marketing expenses were up in the quarter. I'm just curious if you could put that into context in terms of your plans to grow the Dayforce sales capacity throughout 2018 to drive continued growth. 
David Ossip: Nice to speak with you, Karl. The IPO obviously was a tremendous milestone for Ceridian, and we're very proud of what we've accomplished. We were pleased with how the market responded to the Ceridian story which, as you know, is the transformation of the company into one of the leading cloud human capital management businesses. In terms of pipeline and closed rates, we continue to see strong traction inside the market. That, though, has been going on for quite some time, and it's too soon to tell if the IPO has had a material impact on that. 
Arthur Gitajn: With respect to sales and marketing, sales and marketing expenses increased $4.5 million from Q1 last year to Q1 this year. Of that $4.5 million, Lifeworks was $500,000. So say, $4 million for the HCM segment, primarily attributable to higher commission expense because we had stronger sales at the end of last year and -- or higher commission expense due to stronger sales year-over-year, and we also had some additional headcount in marketing. I'm going to hand back to David to talk about potential plans for initiatives on the sales and marketing side. 
David Ossip: Sure. As I mentioned earlier, we're in the early stages of determining which of the growth strategies to fund. There are a number of areas that we are currently looking at. The first is additional headcount in the business development executives. These are the people who do outbound calling to identify active HCM projects. Alongside that, we are looking at increasing the headcount in sales across -- in sales resources across segments. We are also looking at having additional HCM summits. This, again, is where we bring a group of opportunities to a particular location and take them through the Ceridian/Dayforce story. They've been very successful for us in the past. Our next HCM summit is in a few weeks in New York. We are also looking at additional modules to add to the Dayforce platform. Again, as I had mentioned during the road show, it typically takes us about 9 months to get the minimal viable products stood up for a new talent module. Historically, we've been building out about 1 or so per year. Now we obviously can increase the buildout of the actual platform. I mentioned also previously, we're looking at additional investments in Powerpay, which includes both additional outbound callers as well as some R&D work to add some additional HR and talent functionality to that particular platform. In terms of the U.K. market, we're looking at ramping up the BDEs and the sales executives as well as having one or more HCM summits. And as well, we're looking at a number of initiatives around the demands of the emerging gig economy. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. 
Raimo Lenschow: David, quick question. Prior to the IPO, we -- it kind of always like don't touch the Bureau customers because it was a stable source of cash flow to pay the interest. Obviously, you have migrations. You did mention kind of attacking Bureau more aggressively in the plans you just outlined. Can you just talk a little bit about the -- your focus there in terms of being maybe slightly more aggressive or maybe not? And then I have a follow-up for after. 
David Ossip: So right now, our #1 priority is making sure that the clients have a very pleasant experience with Ceridian. So we are quite sensitive to the client's ambitions as to what they would like to do. That being said, we have made adjustments in our sales model for the existing Bureau customers, where we are now pairing a new business sales executive with an account executive to help the client make the right decision for them in terms of movement to the Dayforce platform. 
Raimo Lenschow: Okay, perfect. And then the -- so maybe a quick follow-up, David, on that one. So from what you've seen so far, like how long is that process or like in terms of getting the clients kind of to look and kind of move them? 
David Ossip: Well, the process has been going on for quite a few years, and we have done, I believe, a very good job in keeping the Bureau customers aware of all of the benefits of the Dayforce platform. We have our annual INSIGHTS Conference in October, and generally, we get very good participation of the Bureau customers at that event, as we have a number of training programs for their HR and payroll professionals. It comes down to a matter of having a conversation with the client about their short- and longer-term objectives and whether or not they would like to take advantage of the continuous calculations and the single-platform benefits of the Dayforce application. 
Raimo Lenschow: Okay, perfect. And Arthur, could you remind us on what do the -- if I get a rising interest rate environment, which we have at the moment, like what's the connectivity to the interest you get on the float? Like I don't know if you've done the math, like every 0.5 point of interest, how much does that give to your extra float income? 
Arthur Gitajn: Sure. So each 100 basis point increase in interest rates is projected to have a positive $16 million increase in revenues, and then that would be partially offset by a $7 million increase in interest expense on our floating term debt. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. 
Walter Pritchard: Sorry about that. David, I'm wondering if you could talk about the attach on talent, sort of any metrics you can give us there and what sorts of customers you're seeing the most traction with as it relates to that and Dayforce. 
David Ossip: So we don't report our attachment rates on the talent modules. As we've discussed beforehand, we generally sell in terms of bundles, and we get the -- our largest bundles in our midmarket segment, which effectively goes from about 500-or-so to about 2,500 employees is where we typically would see those particular customers buying the full end-to-end HCM suite. 
Walter Pritchard: Great. And then, Arthur, I guess just one follow-up for -- from Raimo's question on float. Is it possible to talk about what sort of embedded assumption you have in the guidance for this year around float? Or should we assume that the levels that you saw in Q1 are relatively sustainable for the year? 
Arthur Gitajn: We are assuming still some increase in interest rates before year-end, something in the neighborhood of -- we're -- our average in Q1 is 1.75%. We would be looking at an average for the full year in the neighborhood of 1.9%. So still a little bit of an increase through the remainder of the year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Siti Panigrahi with Wells Fargo. 
Sitikantha Panigrahi: Just when you look at your products right now, what sort of like total PEPM opportunity that you have? And what sort of penetration you have currently? And as you talked about the new products coming, what's your goal in terms of achieving that PEPM -- total PEPM? 
David Ossip: Siti, I'll talk in terms of realization, because I think that's more relevant. When we are playing in the middle segment, which, again, is around that 500 to 2,500 employee range, we see realization rates are somewhere between $25 and $30 when the clients buy the full bundle. Now that's obviously less than if you took the -- if you were to take the sum of all of the individualized modules, as there is a little bit of discounting when the clients buy the full bundle. In terms of aspirations, there's still a lot for us to build on the platform, and they vary between certain types of features that would add between $1 of PEPM to about $5 to $10 of PEPM. 
Sitikantha Panigrahi: And then you talked about this gig economy, like the on-demand pay, how big is that opportunity? Do you see currently any provider offering that or any customer requirement or demand at this point? 
David Ossip: It's hard to quantify, but what I can say is if we look at the overall employment numbers, I believe about 40% of the workforce is expected to be flexible workers by 2020. So that obviously is a sizable opportunity for us. What makes it attractive is that our continuous pay calculation allows us effectively to do same-day pay. So you can imagine a situation where you clock in with a mobile device, clock out with a mobile device, and as you clock out, the employee's able to receive the amount, net of all the withholdings, and that's being transferred immediately to a digital wallet or a bank account. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies. 
Howard Ma: This is Howard Ma on for John DiFucci. I guess for David first. So we know you're making a concerted effort in building out your partner program, and -- including global systems integrators. Could you comment on at what point can we expect a meaningful portion of implementations to be outsourced to SIs? 
David Ossip: I think the answer to that really depends on market segmentation. At the moment, we are still very focused on improving the client implementation experience. We've done a lot of work in terms of automation around our Activate technology as well as our Dayforce Link technology, which handles the interface and with hundreds of different types of third-party software and carrier feed providers. We currently do use third parties to augment our implementation teams, and in some cases, they do the end-to-end implementation. As we go upmarket, we typically find that there is a higher opportunity to bring in larger SIs to those end-to-end implementations or to leverage those resources for the change management and the program management features of those particular programs. As we expand also on a global basis, we typically leverage partners as well who have the local domain knowledge and the experience and resources to do those specific types of implementations. But in summary, I would say it's still early days. Give us a few quarters to come back to you on that question. 
Howard Ma: Okay, David. And I have a follow-up for Arthur. Due to the 3- to 9-month lag, so call it 6-month average between contract signing and the customer go-live, upon which you start recognizing per-employee per-month subscription for Dayforce, it's a given like you have really high revenue visibility. And also, because of that, you have a limited ability to impact current year revenue beyond the first quarter. So the reported -- the quarter you just reported. So just given that, can you talk about your revenue visibility for the rest of the year? And what are some potential drivers of upside or downside relative to that at this point in time? 
Arthur Gitajn: Sure. So again, our full year guidance for the year is, cloud revenue is expected to be in the range of $521 million to $524 million, and then total revenue between $730 million, $735 million. We've talked about the high level of visibility and predictability, and of course, the other side of that is that we don't have a lot of levers to pull to significantly increase our predictive results. But we do have some, and you saw them evident in the first quarter. For example, we had an uptick in Powerpay revenue which has a very short implementation cycle. We had a bit of favorable currency interest rate impacts. We had an increase in professional services and other revenue. By definition, it's nonrecurring. That's also an opportunity. And then, finally, I would note, just in passing, as Dave's talked about, we're beginning the planning process for 2019 and we're going to be considering accelerating investments and growth initiatives into the second half. We wouldn't expect any material change in revenue. However, if we have any change in our -- in the guidance we've given you for adjusted EBITDA, we'll talk about that in future quarters. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Robert W. Baird. 
Mark Marcon: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you saw from a competitive perspective in terms of just characterizing your wins in terms of whether they were coming from some of the older established players versus ERPs, et cetera. And also, if you could just talk a little bit about your workforce management modules and how key that was in terms of some of the wins. 
David Ossip: I don't believe we've seen a change in the competitive environment. Typically, about half the time, we replace an incumbent, and the other half, we typically seem to replace what we term white space being -- and white space defined as very old technologies, in-house built solutions, vendors that no longer are around. That refers to what's inside the barrel side of the actual product. In terms of workforce management, we also typically replace probably more white space opportunities. You see us do a lot of in-house time and attendance systems and in-house scheduling systems that we replace. On the talent modules, it depends on what we're selling. Typically, with recruiting, you replace a point solution almost all of the time. Performance management and compensation management, you often replace spreadsheets and e-mail. Employee onboarding, we typically replace a lot of paper. So in terms of what we replace really depends on the bundle that's being sold. Workforce management continues to be a very strong differentiator for us. In the most recent Nucleus Research report, once again, they positioned us as the leader of the Leader quadrant. We find that workforce management is important for a number of reasons. First, a lot of the compliance calculations require access to the hour and now even the scheduling information to do the calculations correctly. And the fact that we have this continuous calculation allows us to do a lot of these compliance calculations more efficiently than the competitors. As well the fact that the pay engine and the workforce management engine runs in entirety in the scheduling side of the app, we also are able to help organizations avoid various types of penalties and irregular costs that they may not be aware of, just given the complexity of the actual environment. Workforce management also is a differentiator for more of the white-collared or desktop workers as well. We're finding that with some of the new multi-jurisdictional rules for higher earners where people move across states, you now have to track the hours. And the various states have those hourly thresholds as to when you have to do withholdings and file the state W-2s. We obviously do that very, very nicely. The other area that we see workforce management as a differentiator is invariably staffed organizations where we're able to use our labor forecasting, our labor deployment, our schedule optimization, labor compliance and schedule compliance rule sets to allow organizations to more effectively staff their various locations, and that typically leads to very strong ROIs across our customer base. 
Mark Marcon: That's great. And can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing, just in terms of the pipeline and the pipeline build? How does that look compared to last year? 
David Ossip: I don't believe we report out on the pipeline metrics. But as I have said, we continue to see strong momentum in the market and strong demand in the market. 
Mark Marcon: Great. And then from an expense perspective, just as we sequence things out, given your comments with regards to sales, Arthur, would it make sense that from a sequential perspective, the line items that may end up seeing some of the strongest growth in terms of SG&A would be primarily focused on sales and marketing? Or how should we think about that? And then, also, while it is within gross profit, how should we think about the R&D spend? 
Arthur Gitajn: Sure. So on the sales and marketing side, again, I'd note that the increase in SG&A was totally sales and marketing, and that you should expect other G&A functions to be flat to down going forward. On the R&D side -- so we would classify our R&D development and management cost basically into 3 categories, depending on the stage development. In accordance with ASC 350, we're required to capitalize certain costs associated with software developed for internal use. And because we're a true cloud company that offers our software on a subscription basis, all of our software development is for internal use. And so when the project reaches the application development phase, certain costs such as design, coding are required to be capitalized. And our capitalized software development were $6.1 million in Q1 compared to $5.4 million in Q1 last year. I'd also note in passing that the amortization of capitalized software for us is -- closely approximates the capitalization. Last year, amortization of capitalized software was $24.5 million compared to $26 million in capitalized software development. Then research and development costs that are incurred before the application development phase, and also costs that don't qualify for capitalization such as administration and training, their expense is incurred, and we include those in product development and management expense as a component of cost to revenue. And then, in the first quarter of 2018, research and development expenses were $6.4 million compared to $5.2 million in the first quarter last year. If you take those first 2 phases together, including both research and development expenses and capitalized software development, our total investment in HCM software development increased by $1.9 million or 18% to $12.5 million compared to $10.6 million last year. And finally, the third category of product development and management costs are costs related to the management of our solutions after the application development phase, and these are expensed as incurred and included in product development and management expenses as a component of cost to revenue. And in the first quarter of '17, product management expenses were $7.3 million compared to $5.6 million in the first quarter last year. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have come to the end of our time allowed for questions. I'd like to turn the floor back to Mr. Ossip for any final remarks. 
David Ossip: Thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. In closing, we are excited by all that we have accomplished to date at Ceridian. Our recent IPO was a significant milestone for the company, and we're pleased with our strong performance in the first quarter. However, these are just steps forward in a longer journey as we continue our longer-term aspiration to be a cloud company generating more than $1 billion of revenue, growing at more than 20% per year with gross margins greater than 75% and EBITDA margins greater than 30%. We remain dedicated to building and delivering innovative technology that helps companies better engage and manage their employees, because when their employees succeed, our customers succeed, and when our customers succeed, we succeed.
 Thank you, again, everyone, for your interest in Ceridian and joining us for the call today. 
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.
