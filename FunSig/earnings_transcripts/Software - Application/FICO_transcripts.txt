===== 2025 Q2  (2025-04-29 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Second Quarter 2025 FICO Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Dave Singleton, please go ahead.
Dave Singleton: Good afternoon, and thank you for attending FICO's second quarter earnings call. I'm Dave Singleton, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Steve Weber. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison with the prior quarter to facilitate an understanding of the run rate of the business. Certain statements made in this presentation are forward looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these risks and uncertainties is contained in the Company's filings with the SEC, particularly in the risks, forward and forward-looking statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the Company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page on the Company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will also be available through April 29, 2026. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Will Lansing.
Will Lansing: Thanks, Dave. Thank you, everyone, for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. In the Investor Relations section of our website, we've posted some financial highlights slides. We'll be referring to them during this earnings announcement. We had another strong quarter, and we are reiterating our fiscal '25 guidance. As shown on Page 2 of the second quarter financial highlights, we reported quarter two revenues of $499 million, up 15% over last year. We reported $163 million in GAAP net income in the quarter up 25%. We reported GAAP earnings of $6.59 per share, up 28% from the prior year. We reported $193 million in non-GAAP net income in the quarter, up 25% and non-GAAP earnings of $7.81 per share, up 27% from the prior year. As you can see on Page 10, we delivered free cash flow of $65 million in our second quarter. Over the last four quarters, we delivered $677 million of free cash flow, which would be an increase of 45% over the trailing 12-month period ending March 31, 2024. We continue to return capital to our shareholders through buybacks by repurchasing 112,000 shares in quarter two. In our Scores segment, you can see on Page 6 of the presentation, our second quarter revenues were $297 million, up 25% versus the prior year. On the B2B side, quarter two revenues were up 31% versus the prior year, primarily driven by mortgage originations revenues. On the B2C side, quarter two revenues were up 6% versus the prior year, primarily driven by revenue from indirect channel partners. Second quarter mortgage origination revenues were up 48% versus the prior year. Mortgage origination revenue accounted for 54% of B2B revenue and 44% of total Scores revenue. Auto origination revenues were up 16%, while credit card, personal loan and other originations revenues were flat versus the prior year. FICO continues to build financial inclusion globally. In the quarter, we announced a Kenya specific FICO score. Through our partnership with TransUnion, the FICO Score is part of a credit risk solution, which empowers lenders to serve previously underserved consumers in small, micro and medium-sized enterprises. We also continue to raise awareness of financial literacy. One way we do it is by encouraging consumers to manage their financial health by checking their free FICO score at myfico.com/free. Over the last year, FICO has seen nearly 70% increase in users accessing their free FICO scores by FICO. I hope you'll tell all of your friends to get their free FICO score at myfico. Most importantly, we continue to focus on innovation. FICO Score mortgage simulator is now available for lender used through Exactus, the largest credit reseller in the mortgage industry. Mortgage professionals can leverage valuable insight from the simulator to help drive smarter decisions that can present more loan options and favorable interest rates for customers. We continue to drive strong adoption of FICO Score 10 T for non-GSE loans and we're seeing strong results from our early adopter program. Lenders who use the classic FICO Score today can receive FICO Score 10 T for free through this program so they can evaluate the advantages before fully moving to utilizing FICO's newest and most predictive score. Lenders in the program have been able to validate the power FICO Score 10 T in real-world mortgage underwriting, loan production, execution and servicing. Refer to the February 24 post in our FICO newsroom to see a list of recent additions to our growing list of FICO 10 T adopters. As of today, we have clients with over $284 billion in annualized mortgage originations and about $1.43 trillion in eligible mortgage portfolio servicing that have signed up for FICO Score 10 T. In our Software segment, we delivered $202 million in quarter two revenue, up 2% from the prior year. The revenue increase was driven mainly by growth in license revenue recognized at a point in time, partially offset by a decline in professional services. We continue to drive growth in ARR and NRR through our land and expand strategy with expand driven by increased customer usage. As shown on Page 7, the total ARR was up 3% with platform ARR growing 17% and non-platform ARR declining 3%. Total NRR for the quarter shown on Page 8, was 102% with platform NRR at 110% and non-platform at 96%. ACV bookings for the quarter were $21.8 million compared to $16.8 million in the prior year. In our software business, we continue to expand our partner channels. FICO recently partnered with Fujitsu, a top digital servicing company in Japan. Together, we will accelerate digital transformation support for Japanese financial institutions, delivering a future of smarter, more connected banking and payments. This quarter, we announced a partnership with dacadoo to bring AI-powered precision to the life insurance industry. Dacadoo is a Swiss-based technology company that develops solutions for digital health engagement and health risk quantification. By integrating FICO platform with dacadoo's Health Risk Quantification Risk Engine, we create a solution that enables insurers to target their life insurance products specific profiles. This allows dacadoo to design highly personalized insurance products for their customers using advanced decision science. Later in the call, I'll talk about our upcoming FICO World Conference, but first, let me pass it to Steve to provide further financial details.
Steve Weber: Thanks, and good afternoon, everyone. As Will mentioned, we had another good quarter with total revenue of $499 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year. Scores segment revenues for the quarter were $297 million, up 25% from the prior year. B2B revenues were up 31%, driven primarily by mortgage originations revenues. Our B2C revenues were up 6% versus the prior year due to increased revenue from our indirect channel partners. Software segment revenues for the quarter were $202 million, up 2% from the prior year. On-premises and SaaS software revenue grew 4% year-over-year, while professional services declined 9%. We do expect Q3 professional services revenue to increase from the Q2 level. This quarter, 86% of total company revenues were derived from our Americas region, which is a combination of our North American and Latin America regions. Our EMEA region generated 9% of revenues and the Asia Pacific region delivered 5%. Our total software ARR was $715 million, a 3% increase over the prior year. Platform ARR was $235 million, representing 33% of our total Q2 '25 ARR, up from 29% of total Q2 '24 ARR. Platform ARR grew 17% versus the prior year, while non-platform declined 3% to $480 million this quarter. We did see some CCS usage headwinds, both platform and non-platform as some customers chose to either delay or downsize some of their customer outreach programs due to macro volatility. Our platform land-and-expand strategy continues to be successful. Our dollar-based net retention rate in the quarter was 102%, platform NRR was 110% and while our non-platform NRR was 96%. Platform NRR was driven by a combination of new use cases and increased usage of existing use cases. Our software ACV bookings for the quarter were $21.8 million compared to $16.8 million in the prior year. We have a healthy pipeline for the back half of this fiscal year. Turning now to expenses for the quarter, as shown on Page 5 of the financial highlight presentation. Total operating expenses were $253 million this quarter versus $260 million in the prior quarter, a decrease of 3%. We expect expenses to be moderately higher in the back half of the year due mainly to our FICO World event and other marketing activities. Our non-GAAP operating margin, as shown in our Reg G schedule, was 58% for the quarter compared with 53% in the same quarter last year. And this means we delivered non-GAAP operating margin expansion of 450 basis points year-over-year. GAAP net income this quarter was $163 million, up 25% from the prior year's quarter. Our non-GAAP net income was $193 million for the quarter, up 25% from the prior year's quarter. GAAP earnings per share this quarter were $6.59, up 28% from the prior year, and our non-GAAP earnings per share were $7.81, up 27% from the prior year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.7%, and the operating tax rate was 24.9%. For the full year, we believe our net effective tax rate will be around 22% and our recurring tax rate will be around 26%. Free cash flow for the quarter was $65 million, a 6% increase from the prior year. Free cash flow was $677 million over the last four quarters, an increase of 45% over the trailing 12-month period ended March 31, 2024. Our accounts receivable balance was up this quarter due to the timing of some large payments that were not received until early April. We anticipate our free cash flow will accelerate in the second half of this fiscal year. At the end of the quarter, we had $192 million in cash and marketable investments. Our total debt at quarter end was $2.53 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 5%. Currently, 51% of our total debt is fixed rate. Our floating rate debt is prepayable at any time giving us the flexibility to use free cash flow to reduce outstanding floating rate debt balances in future periods. Turning to return of capital. We bought back 112,000 shares in the second quarter at an average price of $1,849 per share. We continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. And with that, I'll turn it back to Will for closing comments.
Will Lansing: Thanks, Steve. The macroeconomic environment remains fluid, but our strategy and execution remained consistent. We are well positioned for this fiscal year and remain confident in the fiscal year guidance that we've provided. Our continued innovations drive significant value to our customers. This quarter, we announced several examples. IA Financial Group leverages FICO platform for expanding insurance underwriting. Nationwide's adoption has led to increased speed and credit decisioning and rollout of new strategies. Lloyds Bank has increased credit card approvals and new-to-bank consumer loan approvals. Next week, we're hosting FICO World in Hollywood, Florida, where many of our customers will highlight their own success stories from adopting FICO offerings. Four-day event brings together customers and prospective customers and around the globe to discuss the benefits of making real-time decisions at scale through the power of FICO platform. Customers will explain the benefits of optimizing interactions with consumers using FICO platform. Those customers are realizing improved profits, increased customer acquisition and retention, reduced costs, growth in new product offerings and improved employee efficiency. The event will showcase FICO platform demonstrations and have exciting announcements related to bringing innovation to the market. Some of the content from FICO World will be available in the coming weeks on our YouTube channel. I'd encourage all of you to view the demonstrations and presentations to better understand our customers' excitement around this innovative technology. With that, I'll turn it back to Dave to open up questions.
Dave Singleton: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we're now ready to take questions. Operator, please open the line.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.
Manav Patnaik: Will, typically, this is your kind of beat and raise type quarter. So, I just wanted some perspective on how you thought results came in versus your expectations? And it sounds like everyone else is just holding the guide given the potential uncertainty. Is that what you're thinking along those lines as well?
Will Lansing: Yes, I think that's exactly it. I think we're in an environment with a little more uncertainty than expected. And as usual, we remain conservative though. There's ample time to raise guidance when we're more confident about it, and we're comfortable with where we are.
Manav Patnaik: And then somewhat of a follow-up, I guess, on the software side, I mean, you guys were pretty confident in the reacceleration of software. So, I was just hoping you could give us some context on platform. And then even non-platform was down this quarter. So just curious what's happening there.
Will Lansing: Yes. I think I'd put that in the same category of macroeconomic factor. What we see on the non-platform side is a little lower, I should say, not lower usage, but lower growth in usage of CCS. And I think that reflects our customers' conservatism around the macro environment. And I remain confident that our growth rate on the platform side will be strong, will continue to be strong. We'll strengthen from where it is today. As you know, we don't work quarter-to-quarter, deal slip. We're okay with that. We -- our customers and our salespeople know that we don't go to extraordinary lengths to try to close deals by quarter end. And so, I think there's all those factors at play. But I think the business is still quite healthy, and we feel good about it.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
George Tong: I wanted to see if you can talk a little bit about whether you've seen any changes in credit origination volumes through April, given all the macro uncertainty out there? And if current trends persist, if you can point to where in your guidance range, you would expect to land?
Will Lansing: We haven't seen a lot of change there. But remember, we're a lagging indicator.
Steve Weber: And in terms of the guidance, I mean, we're comfortable with where we are in the guidance. I mean one of the reasons we probably didn't change our guidance this quarter is that there's a lot of uncertainty, right, this can go a lot of different directions. We're confident in our guidance number, but it's difficult to know with as much volatility as there is even what we would change it to, if we were to change it. So, we're sticking with what we have.
George Tong: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then following up on the platform software business, ARR growth decelerated, you mentioned that was due to macro factors. Can you talk about how much visibility you have into reacceleration in platform growth? And will it take macro conditions improving to drive the growth to be accelerate? Or do you have internal idiosyncratic drivers that can get that growth higher?
Will Lansing: We have some level of visibility because we obviously booked the deals ahead of when the revenue is recognized. So, I would say, we do have some visibility, and that's part of my optimism about the business. But I think it is tempered by the macro environment. And so sometimes that means deals take longer to close. We haven't experienced this yet, but you never know, deals might not happen because of the macro environment. So we have the conservatism that goes with that. But in terms of visibility, our visibility says our business is healthy and should reaccelerate.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open.
Stephen Pollock: Stephen Pollock on for Jeff. Just on that point, are you seeing any changes in the customer approach towards the platform sales cycles, things -- are you seeing longer cycles, longer decision times? Any changes in sort of the contract terms or anything around that?
Will Lansing: Not so far. So, I would say that -- we've talked about this in the past. The platform is increasingly a strategic purchase by our customers. And it's part of a bigger strategic plan to be more consumer-focused and to optimize all kinds of interaction with the consumer. So, I wouldn't say we're immune from macro conditions, but I do think that we're such a critical part of the strategy for our customers that it's not really going to the back burner or it's not getting canceled just because conditions are not perfect. That said, that's today and who knows how that affects us in the future. But today, we're not seeing it. The deal cycles have not really slowed. No.
Stephen Pollock: Okay. And then on sort of insurance partners -- or customers that you've announced. If you could just talk with the go to market for some of the nonfinancial services customers, is that direct? Is that through partners, kind of maybe what's driving maybe some of the traction in some of the non-financial services segments.
Will Lansing: It's both. It's both. But as you know, we have been putting increasing emphasis on our indirect channel. And so, there is more activity there, and we are getting more deals outside of our direct sales force.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Next question comes from Simon Clinch with Redburn Atlantic. Your line is open.
Simon Clinch: I was wondering if we could just go back to your comments that nothing's really changed in terms of client behavior or volumes through April. But I was wondering if you could perhaps break it down. Was that an overall comment around sort of the aggregate level of volumes? Or is there any sort of detail at the sort of vertical level, which you can share with us?
Steve Weber: You're talking about the Scores business?
Simon Clinch: Sorry, in Scores.
Steve Weber: So, I mean, honestly, we don't have real-time data, frankly. I mean you'd be better off getting information from the bureaus on that. They can track it on a day-to-day basis. As Will said, we get our reporting in arrears. So, we have some anecdotal information, but we don't have the heck of real data today with us.
Simon Clinch: Okay. Understood. And then just a secondary going back to the software business. And I mean the booking strength was notable this quarter. That's sort of maintained as why everything was going on. I just wonder if you could give us some a little context around pipeline build and that's sort of touching on the demand side as opposed to just the deal slipping.
Will Lansing: The demand side is strong. The pipeline is strong. The current bookings, as you can see, are strong. So, it's all in a good direction.
Steve Weber: Yes. I mean, again, where we saw the headwinds were on CCS, and it's just about how a lot of our existing customers are reaching out to their consumers. And if there are accounts growth slows down, and you're going to see a slowdown in CCS volume. So, a lot of this is -- it has nothing to do with the products necessarily. It's just about how they interact with their consumers.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Jason Haas with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Jason Haas: I'm curious if you could give us any sense for what sort of price increase you took in auto. Just so we can get a sense for maybe in the quarter, how much was volume versus price driven since there's an acceleration there?
Will Lansing: We don't comment on price increases until we make them.
Steve Weber: You talked about ones that are already made. The ones that we have this quarter.
Jason Haas: Yes.
Steve Weber: So, there's definitely an impact from the pricing what we've done so far...
Jason Haas: I see. Yes.
Will Lansing: Of course, yes. I mean as the price increase feathers in, as it becomes recognized over the course of the year, price becomes a bigger component, change in price becomes a bigger component of our revenue increase. And so yes, that is happening as we speak.
Steve Weber: But we don't specifically call out the percentage of price increase versus volume increase.
Jason Haas: Got it. Okay. That's fair. And then as a follow-up, it looks like the growth in person outlet expense has maybe moderated a little bit. I wasn't sure if that was just timing where you're finding some efficiencies there?
Steve Weber: Yes, that doesn't even have anything to do with head count. In essence, there was -- some of it's around fringe, some of it's around -- some of are truing up our supplemental retirement plan. So it has nothing to do with headcount per se. It has more to do with some of the fringe costs around that. So, we got a benefit this quarter that we probably won't have next quarter of a few million dollars.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Faiza Alwy: I wanted to ask about the Scores business. It looks like there was a pretty substantial increase in the non-origination of B2B Scores revenue. And I'm curious if there was something specific that you can point to there?
Steve Weber: There's just a lot of -- I mean nothing really anything in particular. There's a lot of things that were kind of -- some of it's in some license sales and some in the international markets. Some of it is a little bit more of a prescreen. There's just a lot of things -- nothing specific to call up, but there's just a lot of things that kind of added to the non-originations this quarter.
Faiza Alwy: Okay. Understood. And then Will, I wanted you about...
Steve Weber: We do have some of those -- We do have a lot of -- quarter-to-quarter, we do have some fluctuation in that number. So, there will always be some quarters there are a little bit higher than others.
Faiza Alwy: Okay. Okay. Will, I wanted to ask you about just the regulatory environment, there's obviously been a lot of shifts postelection, and you've had some of these new regulators settled into their new roles. So curious how you're thinking about the evolving situation, if you've had any conversations? And anything you can share in terms of your perspective there?
Will Lansing: Well, we're always in conversations with the appropriate regulators and agencies and nothing has really changed. We continue to be in touch with them and talk about our industry and how we ought to go forward with it. I would say that the regulatory environment is a good one for FICO. We're pleased with where we are. It's all basically good news for us.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Surinder Thind: Well, maybe could you possibly comment on just kind of the DBNRR number? Obviously, it's slowed down a little bit. But is there a way to disaggregate the client behavior there in the sense that is it clients have stopped or slowed down kind of the implementation of use cases in the current environment? Or is it more a case of they're just running existing use cases maybe less frequently?
Will Lansing: Yes. I would say usage itself. We're not losing customers. And they're not postponing what they do, but things that are usage-based we're seeing less usage. And I really think that's ebbing or flow thing, it has to do with the environment.
Steve Weber: And Surinder, in most cases, it's not like they're really declining. In a lot of cases, it's just not growing as fast as they were in the past.
Surinder Thind: Yes. I stand corrected there. It's just the growth rate has slowed down, and it was this idea of whether clients are just slower to maybe adopt new use cases as you move from one division to the next to next as well, right, versus....
Will Lansing: I don't know it's so much that. I think it's more of the usage itself. I really think it's an environmental factor.
Surinder Thind: Got it. And then maybe a question for you, Steve. Just on the expenses, the SG&A numbers, how do we think about the run rate excluding the expenses that are associated with the FICO World Conference.
Steve Weber: Yes. So, we will have higher expenses in the back half of the year. We do -- obviously, at FICO world, we have -- so marketing expense is primarily on the Score side that we've got in the back half of the year that will add some more expense to it. We're adding headcount as well, but it's not all that dramatic. As we've said, obviously, for several quarters, we are having a headcount where we can bring in good people, but it doesn't -- it's not all that material. So, from that point of view, you're not going to see a lot of increase in expenses.
Surinder Thind: Got it. So, excluding FICO World, not a material increase, in expenses in the back half?
Steve Weber: I'm sorry, say that again.
Surinder Thind: So, excluding FICO World, not a material increase, in expenses because that's a big onetime line item, right?
Steve Weber: Yes. I mean there's other expenses that we'll have some marketing expenses, too. So, I mean if you look at what's implied in the guide, there is additional expenses that will be in the back half of the year. But obviously, FICO World is a big part of that.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC.
Ashish Sabadra: I just wanted to ask a question on software as well. How do we think about the timing of converting some of that ACV. We've seen pretty strong ACV in the first half of '25, the timing of that converting over to ARR.
Steve Weber: It's probably nine months -- six to nine months before the conversion takes place. It depends on the individual customer. Some customers, if they're a little more sophisticated, they are easier to implement, it could be a little bit quicker than that. But usually, it's in that six- to nine-month range.
Dave Singleton: And then, Ashish, it does take three months to kind of ramp that up, so you -- I kind of think of it more like 9 to 12 when it's fully ramped, but he's right, six to nine when it kind of kicks off.
Ashish Sabadra: That's very helpful color. And maybe just a quick clarification on the auto origination revenues. There was a comment there during the Q&A about pricing getting feathered in. So, if our understanding is right, there was only a partial benefit of pricing in the quarter, and we should continue to see that incremental benefit as we go forward? Is that a right assumption?
Steve Weber: Yes. I mean, well, auto is the same as everything else. So, we repriced it effective January 1. Sometimes it doesn't all roll in right away on January 1. So sometimes, it takes a little bit of time for the full benefit of that to hit. But the auto pricing is the same way as mortgage and auto -- mortgage and credit card as well.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Kyle Peterson with Needham. Your line is open.
Kyle Peterson: Let us start on the buyback and capital allocation. Historically, you guys have been fairly steady and formulaic as to how much you guys have returned to shareholders. Obviously, we seem to be in a more volatile equity market environment. How are you guys kind of thinking about balancing, returning cash to shareholders versus potentially being like opportunistic and maybe stepping up a little bit more if we do get some short-term blips? Any color there on how you guys are thinking about that would be really helpful.
Will Lansing: Our philosophy there has not really changed. We've said in the past and it continues to be true that we're not market timers. We have a big view of the future value of our company, the value today and the future value. And so, we're really committed to the stock buyback. And we don't spend a ton of time thinking about is this a great time to back up the truck versus should we stay out of the market because it feels pricey. We pretty much by consistently and we're pretty happy with that. That said, there have been times in our history, as you know, where we felt like the market was punishing us with a bad understanding of our prospects. And so, we -- although we've historically tried to match our free cash flow to our stock purchases, there have been times when we have exceeded that by quite a bit. And for a one- to two-year period, we did just a few years ago. And that's not on the question. I think you'll see us continuing to buy regularly into the future. And as opportunities present themselves, we do sometimes heavy out.
Kyle Peterson: Okay. That's really helpful. And then maybe a follow-up on software. I know several other guys have asked about this, but any color on kind of what you guys are seeing maybe a little more under the hood. Is some of the sales cycle changes and such. Have there been any changes in like whether it's like by geographies or bank size or anything like that over the last, like, call it, few months or something? Or is a lot of the decision-making pretty consistent with what you guys have historically seen and kind of shared on recent calls before this?
Steve Weber: No, I don't think we've seen -- any discernible trends that way. And actually, if you look at, the bookings have been pretty good. So, where we've seen some slowdown is in some of the usage. But we haven't really seen any changes in behavior with -- depending on region or geography or size of bank.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Josh Dennerlein with BofA Securities. Your line is open.
Josh Dennerlein: Just wanted to touch base on the platform. I know you are continually rolling out new solutions on that side. Could you remind us what you're rolling out solution-wise this year on the platform? And then just maybe provide some context on how -- when you've added solutions in the past just impacted growth?
Steve Weber: Yes, we -- well, so I would say that the largest number of solutions and use cases are related to the credit risk life cycle and things that we've historically done with our legacy applications. So, originations, line management, that sort of thing. I would say that our fraud solutions on the platform are still in process. So, some of the fraud solutions are available on the platform, some new ones are available on the platform that you couldn't get before. And some of the old ones are not available yet. So, I would say that's more of a work in progress in terms of where we are. I would expect that virtually all of our fraud solutions will be available on the platform next year.
Dave Singleton: And Josh, there will be announcements about innovation on FICO platform at FICO World.
Josh Dennerlein: Okay. I appreciate that, Dave. Is there -- do you guys I think...
Will Lansing: I would encourage anyone who's interested to -- if you're not an attending FICO World, check out the FICO World YouTube videos because we'll go into a lot of detail on what's being released.
Josh Dennerlein: You guys typically end up getting like with people who are coming to FICO World, do you see like a sales growth bump from that, does that convert to a lot of sales?
Will Lansing: Yes, absolutely. I would say that it's our number one sales pipeline building effort. What happens is we put a ton of energy into making available all of our top technical personnel so that customers, prospective customers can really get a deep understanding of what we can do for them. We couple that with meeting other customers who have implemented our solutions. And there's a lot of transfer of knowledge and frankly, we don't do a lot of selling. It's really being done by our customers explaining to other customers and potential customers, what they're doing and where they're having success and where they're not. So, it used to be just a show and tell -- and now I would say that most of the customers who come, get a very personalized, customized several days, focused specifically on the needs of their bank, that needs their financial institution and how we best can serve them. And typically, with references and introductions to other customers who've already done what they'd like to do. So, it winds up being a huge channel pipeline building activity.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Scott Wurtzel: Just one for me, the color on some of the channel partners that you're working with in the software business is helpful. Just wondering how you feel overall about the partner network in the software business and how that's running right now.
Will Lansing: We continue to believe it's a big opportunity for us. We don't have as much indirect sales as we would like, and we continue to invest in the indirect channel with a view to increasing it. We've talked about this in the past. We have a really dynamic direct sales force. That said, it's quite small. If you compare our IP with our distribution strength in direct sales, it's fairly obvious that those are mismatched. And although we're taking a lot of initiative around that, we're adding salespeople. We're growing our direct sales. We recognize that the real opportunity is to expand the indirect sales. And so, we have. We've been investing in it. We have a lot of people working on it right now and for different kinds of things. We have geographic reach that's occurring. We have diversification into nonfinancial services verticals. We have work going with SIs. And interestingly, the work with the SIs is not just the transfer of our professional services work to them. But they're actually taking our IP and building proprietary solutions for themselves that they use with their customers. And so, I think it's really nice. It's a partnership where we get the professional services extra capacity, if you want to call it that, coupled with them as a channel, a true channel for moving our IP to market.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with UBS. Your line is open.
Kevin McVeigh: Great. Would you expect some of the lower kind of usage in CCS to kind of capture that in the back half of this year? Or is that something that you think potentially gets pushed out to '26?
Will Lansing: Wow. Your guess is as good as ours. It's just so hard to say. Our business is built around doing some amount of kind of base level revenue for getting something underway and then built on usage. And we can't really control the usage except to the extent that we teach our customers how to get more value by expanding the usage. But kind of the economic activity level of the usage is something we can't really control. And I don't really have visibility there. I don't know which way it goes.
Kevin McVeigh: It's helpful. And then with the partner channel on the implementation work, is that explaining some of the recent trends in the professional services? Because it seems like the bookings have really scaled. Or is it just the size of the bookings? Just trying to reconcile the professional services trends against, obviously, what's been pretty good bookings overall.
Steve Weber: Yes. I would say this quarter, some of it was actually timing. We had some milestones that had to be met in order to reclaim the revenue, and it ticked over from March into April. So, there's a little bit of a timing there. You will probably see the -- I think we even referenced this in the prepared remarks, that we expect the PS actually, the revenue to come up a little bit in the back half and even in our third quarter.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Matthew O'Neill with FT Partners. Your line is open.
Matthew O’Neill: Many good questions asked and answered here. So, I thought I would open -- ask a more open-ended one, just around sort of strategic priorities, but recognize that FICO World is next week. So, whatever you may be willing to preview as far as kind of the focus for the remainder of the year and beyond what would be really interesting.
Will Lansing: Well, I think what you'll see at FICO World is a whole bunch of new capabilities. You'll see a little bit more on the way we're using AI. On the Score side, you'll see some of the innovation that we have coming. We're just gearing up on FICO 11, so you'll get a little taste of that. So those are the kinds of things that we expect to be announcing next week.
Operator: And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. And as such, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.
Will Lansing: Thank you.
Dave Singleton: Thank you.

===== 2025 Q1  (2025-02-04 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by, and welcome to First Quarter 2025 FICO Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to our first speaker today, Dave Singleton. Please go ahead.
Dave Singleton: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for attending FICO's first quarter earnings call. I'm Dave Singleton, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Steve Weber. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison with the prior quarter to facilitate an understanding of the run rate of the business. Certain statements made in this presentation are forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these risks and uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, particularly in the risk factors and forward-looking statements portion of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Reg G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most appropriate comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the investor relations page of the company’s website at fico.com or on the SECs website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through February 4, 2026. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Will Lansing.
Will Lansing: Thanks Dave and thank you everyone for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. In the Investor Relations section of our website, we've posted some financial highlight slides that we will be referring to during this earnings announcement. We had another strong quarter and are reiterating our fiscal 2025 guidance. As shown on page 2 of the first quarter financial highlights, we reported quarter one revenues of $440 million, up 15% over last year. We reported $153 million in GAAP net income in the quarter up 26% and GAAP earnings of $6.14 per share, up 28% from the prior year. We reported $144 million in non-GAAP net income in the quarter, up 19% and non-GAAP earnings of $5.79 per share, up 20% from the prior year. As shown on Page 10, we delivered free cash flow of $187 million in our first quarter and $673 million over the last four quarters, an increase of 36% over the prior period. We continue to return capital to our shareholders through buybacks. We repurchased 79,000 shares in quarter one and an additional 47,000 shares in January. In our Scores segment on page six of the presentation, our first quarter revenues were $236 million, up 23% versus the prior year. On the B2B side, quarter one revenues were up 30% versus the prior year, primarily driven by mortgage originations revenues from both pricing and volume increases. On the B2C side, quarter one revenues were up 3% versus the prior year, primarily driven by revenue from indirect channel partners. First quarter mortgage originations revenues were up 110% versus the prior year. Mortgage origination revenue accounted for 44% of B2B revenue and 34% of total scores revenue. Auto origination revenues were up 5% while credit card, personal loan and other originations revenues were down 3% versus the prior year. This week we issued a press release on the study we conducted with our partner, Affirm. That study concluded that the inclusion of Buy Now Pay later loan data can drive a FICO score increase for some consumers while improving model risk performance for lenders when applying FICO's innovative treatment to that data. The study also helped inform responsible furnishing of Buy Now Pay later loans to the credit bureaus. We're currently working with stakeholders to identify the best way to introduce our proprietary treatment of this data to the credit scoring marketplace. We'll be sharing more details soon. We continue to drive strong adoption of FICO Score 10 T for non GSE mortgages. This quarter, loans utilizing FICO Score 10 T began trading on MCT Marketplace, the largest mortgage asset exchange for the US Secondary market. In addition, Cardinal Financial formed and traded the first government issued mortgage backed security featuring loans powered by FICO Score 10 T. I'm proud of these strong achievements and look forward to continued progress in the quarters ahead. We now have clients with over 261 billion in annualized mortgage originations and approximately 1.43 trillion in eligible mortgage portfolio servicing that have signed up for FICO Score 10 T, with some firms already adopting FICO 10 T to make credit decisions for securitization and for delivery to investors. FICO 10 T for conforming mortgages sold to the GSEs will be rolled out based on the timeline of the FHFA's implementation of enterprise Credit Score requirements. In January, the FHFA announced it no longer has a specific timeline for the implementation. In our software segment we delivered $204 million in quarter one revenue, up 8% from last year. Revenue increase was driven mainly by growth in SaaS software and license revenue, partially offset by the foreign exchange rate impact. We continue to drive growth in ARR and NRR through our Land and Expand strategy with expand driven by increased customer usage. As shown on page 7, the total ARR was up 6% with platform ARR growing 20% and non-platform ARR of 1%. Total NRR for the quarter shown on page 8 was 105% with platform NRR at 112% and non-platform at 100%. Foreign exchange had negative impact of 2% on total ARR and 3% on platform ARR. ACV bookings for the quarter were 21.2 million compared to 18.3 million in the prior year. We continue to drive our software business forward. Our investments are helping progress development of new FICO platform capabilities, partner channel adoption, FICO marketplace realization and building scalability to improve our cost structure. We continue to be recognized for our innovation. This quarter, FICO was awarded Best Anti-Fraud Solution at the Credit and Collections Technology Awards. The award was given to the FICO Customer Communication Service Scam Signal Solution which uniquely uses telephony signals to detect potential scams. Our innovative work using blockchain technology for responsible AI model governance yielded the Tech of the Future Blockchain and Tokenization Award at the Banking Tech Awards and won a Software Category Transformative Product Award at the Big Innovation Awards. Our software business will be on display this year at FICO World Event which will take place in Hollywood, Florida in May. At this four day event, we'll bring together industry professionals from around the world to connect, share best practices and learn how FICO enables organizations to power customer connections at scale. We'll highlight successful clients and demonstrate the power of FICO platform, enabling companies to operationalize, analytics, become more composable and make better decisions at scale. I'll now pass it over to Steve to provide further financial details.
Steve Weber: Thanks Will, and good afternoon everyone. As Will mentioned, we had another good quarter with total revenue of $440 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year. Scores segment revenues for the quarter were $236 million, up 23% from the prior year. B2B revenues were up 30% driven primarily by mortgage originations revenues, as Will said, from both pricing and volume increases. Our B2C revenues were up 3% versus the prior year due to increased revenue from our indirect Channel Partners. Software segment revenues for the quarter were $204 million, up 8% from the prior year, hindered by foreign exchange rate impact. On-premises and SaaS Software revenue grew 10% year-over-year while professional services declined 14%. This quarter, 87% of total company revenues were derived from our Americas region which is a combination of our North America and Latin America regions. Our EMEA region generated 8% of revenues and the Asia Pacific region delivered 5%. Our total software ARR was $729 million, a 6% increase over the prior year. Platform ARR was $228 million representing 31% of our total Q1, 25 ARR and was up 28% and up from 28% of total Q1, 24 ARR. Platform ARR grew 20% versus the prior year while non-platform grew 1% to $501 million this quarter. As a reminder, foreign exchange had a negative impact of 2% on total ARR and 3% on platform ARR. We continue to focus on FICO platform growth while retaining our non-platform customers. Over time we do expect migration of those non platform customers to platform products. Our platform land and expand strategy continues to be successful. Our dollar based net retention rate in the quarter was 105%. Platform NRR was 112% while our non-platform NRR was 100%. Platform NRR was driven by a combination of new use cases and increased usage of existing use cases. Our software ACV bookings for the quarter were $21.2 million compared to $18.3 million in the prior year. Turning now to expenses for the quarter as shown on Page 5 of the financial highlight presentation, total operating expenses were $260 million this quarter versus $257 million in the prior quarter, an increase of 1.5%. We anticipate our expenses increasing modestly throughout the year, which will again include cost for FICO World in our third quarter. Our non-GAAP operating margin as shown in our Reg. G schedule was 50% for the quarter compared with 48% in the same quarter last year. We delivered non-GAAP margin expansion of 209 basis points year-over-year. GAAP net income this quarter was $153 million, or 26% from the prior year. Our non-GAAP net income was $144 million for the quarter, up 19% from the prior year's quarter. GAAP earnings per share this quarter were $6.14 up 28% from the prior year and our non-GAAP earnings per share were $5.79, up 20% from the prior year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was negative 1.6%. The operating tax rate was 24.3%. The effective tax rate for the quarter includes $40 million of reduced tax expense from excess tax benefits recognized upon the settlement or exercise of employee stock awards. As a reminder, excess tax benefit does not impact our non-GAAP net income. For the full year we expect our net effective tax rate will be around 22% and our recurring tax rate will be around 26%. Free cash flow for the quarter was $187 million, 55% increase from the same quarter last year. Free cash flow was $673 million over the last four quarters, which was an increase of 36% over the prior period. At the end of the quarter we had $230 million in cash and marketable investments. Our total debt at quarter end was $2.42 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 5%. Currently, 53% of our total debt is fixed rate. Our floating rate debt is prepayable at any time, giving us the flexibility to use free cash flow to reduce outstanding floating rate debt balances in future periods. Turning to return of capital, we bought back 79,000 shares in the first quarter at an average price of $2,015 per share. We purchased an additional 47,000 shares in January at an average price of $1,905 per share and we do continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. With that, I'll turn it back to Will for his closing comments.
Will Lansing: Thanks Steve. The macroeconomic environment remains fluid, but our strategy and execution remain consistent. We're well positioned for this fiscal year and remain confident in the guidance we provided last quarter. Our software and scores businesses continue to be best-in-class. Our software customers are delighted by our ability to help them optimize interactions with their end customers through data driven composable solutions that are executed in real time. Fiscal 25 marks the second year of the FICO Educational Analytics Challenge Program which was created to encourage students in data science, engineering and technology. To date, we've partnered with seven colleges and universities. This year, students in this program are getting hands on experience learning to develop analytics AI models to detect fraud. In our Scores business we expanded our Global Financial Inclusion Initiative through our Lenders Leading Inclusion Program. FICO provides cutting edge alternative data scores and financial inclusion strategies to lenders so they can responsibly expand access to credit for underserved communities. On the innovation side, we're in talks with resellers and close to launching our FICO Score Mortgage Simulator which enables mortgage professionals to run credit event scenarios by applying simulated changes in an applicant's credit report data to simulate potential changes to the applicant's FICO Sport. With that, I'll turn the call back to Dave and we'll open up the Q&A.
Dave Singleton: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take questions. Operator, please open the line.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes in line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is open.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. Will, I just had a big picture question and you talked about the FHFA pushing out the directors on bi-merge and the scoring. They've got a new director in there. There's talk of, the GSE privatizing. Just how do you look at these changes? Do you think GSE privatization has any impact to the status of the FICO score? Any kind of broad color around that would be helpful.
Will Lansing: Sure. Well, so the decision by the FHFA to push out to an indeterminate date, the implementation of bi-merge and a two score system is not really surprising. I think everyone in the industry believes that the industry is not ready to make this move. And so there's really not a lot of surprise there. With respect to the GSEs, I think it's important to recognize that before the GSEs ever entered conservatorship, they had selected the FICO score and were using the FICO score in evaluating the paper that they then securitized and passed to investors. And so, and then obviously that's continued through the present time. In a world which who knows whether the GSEs will come out of conservatorship or not, but in a world in which potentially they would, we don't really see a lot of change. I mean, if you go back to the fundamentals, the FICO score is the, is really the best way for investors to understand the risk in the paper that they're buying. And we don't see that changing, whether the government is more or less involved with the GSEs. And I guess I would further point out that in every other market, where the government is not involved, we have a very strong market share because of the efficacy of the score. So a long way of saying not a lot of change.
Manav Patnaik: Okay. Fair enough. And then, Will, if I can just ask you on the software business. I think you were expecting ARR to be in the 30%, and now we're talking 20%. Was there something in the quarter timing-wise, bookings or can you just talk about if 20% now is the new growth rate we should be thinking about?
Will Lansing: Yes. That's -- I'm glad you pointed it out. It's -- I don't -- I wouldn't read too much into any particular quarter. This quarter, we got dinged a little bit with foreign exchange. But really, the biggest driver is the fact that it flows through from bookings and we had some weaker bookings quarters in the past. We haven't revised our view about the kind of long-term growth trajectory for the platform business, which is in the 30s, 30% or so. And so I wouldn't read too much into this quarter's number.
Steve Weber: Yes. And Manav, we actually do expect ARR to accelerate in the back half even in the coming quarters. So we knew this was going to be a lighter quarter because, again, like Will said, the weaker bookings we had the first couple of quarters last year, and then we got hit by the FX, particularly in Brazil, that had a pretty significant impact this quarter.
Manav Patnaik: Okay, thanks a lot guys.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question will come from the line of Jason Haas from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Jason Haas: Hey good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. I'm curious if you could talk about how fiscal 1Q came in versus your expectations? And the genesis of the question is, I'm curious, I know you're holding the guidance, but I'm curious if there's any less conservative now than it was prior to the results of this quarter coming in?
Will Lansing: Well, I would say that we're not really surprised. As you know, we provide conservative guidance, and I think that our internal view on interest rates was more conservative than the general market view, and we built our guidance around that. So for us, no change to our guidance, and really no surprise in terms of what we're seeing right now.
Steve Weber: Yes. And I would just add to that. I mean, this pretty much came in according to our plan. We -- there's a lot of seasonality to the Scores business. So if you look at it on a year-over-year basis versus the fourth quarter versus our first quarter, it makes a lot of sense. What's further out, in terms of Q3 and Q4, it's harder to know what's going to happen with the current rate environment, but we didn't expect a lot of things to happen this quickly. So this pretty much came in line with what we expected.
Jason Haas: Got it. That's helpful. I know we're pretty early to the start of the calendar year, but I was curious if you could talk to -- any sense to be you're seeing as you've put in the new -- or started to put in new prices for mortgage scores and also auto scores?
Will Lansing: Well, I mean it is very early, but we have socialized the pricing for 2025 and everything’s gone just as expected and no real issues.
Steve Weber: We don't see really any elasticity...
Jason Haas: Helpful, yes. Thank you.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question will come from the line of Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Faiza Alwy: Yes, hi thank you. I wanted to follow up on the software question and just your confidence in accelerating platform ARR back to 30%, can you give us a bit more color on what's driving that confidence? Do you expect sort of increased usage? Is there a new business that you're expecting? And just a bit more color on where you're getting more traction.
Will Lansing: Yes. And so your question suggests the answer. The usage, we obviously don't control. That part of the equation moves around and it kind of depends on what the customers do. And so this particular quarter, we had lower usage. In terms of predictability, and do we have confidence in the rate accelerating back into the 30% range, we do have that confidence. And that's because of a direct flow-through from bookings. So we know what the bookings look like that we'll be driving ARR growth in the future. And so we have a high level of confidence.
Steve Weber: Yes. I mean there's a timing piece between when something is booked and when it goes live. So we have advanced -- we can see when things will go live and at what point then that will turn at ARR. So we've -- for the last few quarters, we've had some pretty strong bookings, and we have a good idea of when those will go live and when the ARR will roll off. So that piece, as Will said, the usage is harder to understand, but it's -- or the forecast, but the deals that we signed, we have a pretty good idea of when they're going to go live, what kind of ARR they will deliver.
Faiza Alwy: Understood. And then just as a follow-up on the Scores business. I think you mentioned higher volume in mortgage. I'm curious if you can give us a bit more color on what you're expecting in terms of volume across the verticals for this year? Sort of what's embedded in the guide, just given the fact that we have seen sort of rates go back up between November.
Will Lansing: I could ask you the same question about the future. We all have our crystal balls. We really -- we don't know what direction interest rates will go. We don't know when they'll come down. We don't know when the volumes will come up as a result of them coming down. I can tell you that our guidance was built around a view that rates would not come down much in 2025. And so far, things are playing out roughly the way we expected. If rates come down in the back half of the year, that will be a tremendous benefit for us. And if they don't, we're prepared for that and our guidance reflects that.
Faiza Alwy: Understood. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question will come from the line of Surinder Thind from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Surinder Thind: Thank you. Following up on the platform ARR question, it looks like it was mostly related to just a slowdown in the NRR at particular clients. So is the messaging here it was predominantly just usage and that things just kind of slowed down? Or how should we think about that? Like what percentage of revenue is characterized...
Will Lansing: A lot of it is usage. So I mean you're absolutely right. A lot of it's usage. But some of it is lower bookings that are now flowing through.
Steve Weber: Yes. But the NRR piece is usage. We didn't have churn. We didn't have customers leaving. We had some customers that for some of our products, the usage can vary quite a bit quarter-to-quarter. And they -- in some cases, they might have turned some things down at the end of the calendar year to save some money, which happens from time to time. So that's the seasonality around different pieces of some of what their usage is. So that's really what drove that. And we expect a lot of that returns to form and then we also expect a lot of the new business that we've already sold will come live.
Surinder Thind: Got it. So there's -- what it sounds like is if usage returns to normal then there's kind of a double bounce back effect here, right? Because you'll get working...
Steve Weber: Exactly. Exactly. Yes.
Surinder Thind: And then fair enough. And then in terms of just the FICO 10 T and the non-GSE usage adoption. Can you talk a little bit more about that? And then maybe contrast that with the kind of the delay at the FHFA in terms of the time line being suspended for implementation. Does a bifurcation in the market between classic FICO and 10 T have any implications that we should be aware from securitization or other considerations here as we think about this longer term? Because obviously, it sounds like on one path, there's a certain number of entities that are going down the top of 10 T, but then with conforming, we may not be going down that path.
Will Lansing: Well, I mean it's a very interesting question. I think what you have to start with is that the FICO Classic score that's been in use for 25 years in the mortgage market is a highly predictive score. It works really, really well. And it has historically provided the investor community with a pretty good sense of what they're buying and the risk associated with it. FICO 10 T is a little bit better. Some would say quite a bit better, some would say a little bit better. We're -- I'm not sure it makes that much difference whether it's a little better or a lot better. Its better enough that we have customers who prefer it. I'm not sure that the answers you get from 10 T are very different from the classic FICO score. And so I don't imagine tremendous [indiscernible] investor community about which score is being used to securitize those portfolios. I imagine they will both be used with no real issues.
Surinder Thind: Okay, thank you. That’s helpful.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question will come from the line of Owen Lau from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Owen Lau: Thank you for taking my question. So go back to the ACV bookings, it was strong in the first quarter. Could you please talk about the pipeline and outlook of bookings over the next quarter or so? Do you expect this to also accelerate to also drive high ARR going forward?
Steve Weber: Yes. I mean, honestly, we have a strong pipeline. But again, we will have volatility in that bookings number. Some quarters will be really good, some quarters won't be as good because we don't have thousands of bookings. We have a fairly small number, and some of them are pretty large, and they can move from quarter-to-quarter. So there's still a lot of interest in these products. We still have a strong pipeline, but it's hard to put hard numbers out there about what we expect in the next couple of quarters. We think we'll have a good year for bookings. But every year, every quarter, there's some volatility in that. But again, we put up two quarters that we're really happy with, the last two quarters, and that's going to have an impact as we move through the year in terms of ARR.
Owen Lau: Got it. And then on the expense side, could you please add more color on that? I think you mentioned expense will go up from here. And in the third quarter, there will be FICO World. Any more color you can add in terms of, let's say, how much increase from the first quarter runway from here? Thanks.
Steve Weber: Yes. It's not all that significant. And if you put together a model with the guidance we gave you there's no change to that. But there are some things that are nonrecurring. The FICO World adds probably $5 million, $6 million in our third quarter that we won't see yet in our second quarter. So there are things like that to come along from time to time. But we won't have any material step function type expense increases throughout the year.
Owen Lau: Thanks a lot.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question will come from the line of Kyle Peterson from Needham. Your line is open.
Kyle Peterson: Thanks guys for taking the questions. I wanted to start off on capital allocation. It does seem like you guys did kind of amp up the full -- or the buyback in January when the stock start to pull back some. I guess, should we think about you guys having the appetite to continue to do that if the stock continues to be off highs despite the results you guys have put up.
Will Lansing: Yes. Well, look, you know our view on this. We think FICO stock is a great value at $1,800 or $1,900 or $2,000, $2,100 as we did in the last quarter. And in the fullness of time, we're sure what we've indicated we try -- we're not really market timers. We try to be in the market kind of all the time with regular purchases to use up our cash flow and maintain our leverage at kind of a comfortable level. That said, when the stock dips, we do sometimes size up our purchases, and we have a lot open on the authorization so that we have the ability to do that should we choose to ramp up. So kind of a long way of saying, we believe in the stock. We think it's a pretty good value where it is. And yes, we have appetite for more.
Kyle Peterson: Okay. That's really helpful. And maybe just a follow-up on the guide. I think kind of looking at from when you guys last reported to now, I guess, obviously, you guys are reiterating the guide. It does look like the mortgage environment seems a little worse, I guess. Could you walk us through, did you guys just have maybe a more conservative assumption than the market had in November when you guys guided? Or are there any other offsets or moving pieces we should be mindful of that helped offset incremental mortgage softness.
Will Lansing: I think it's really a combination of two things. One is I think we did have a more conservative view, a less optimistic view of the future of rates several months ago when we put together the guidance than the market. Certainly, at the time we put our guidance out there, people anticipated a lot more rate cuts in 2025 than we're likely to get. So that is part of it. And then I would say on top of that, you have a management team that always wants to hit its numbers. And so we're conservative. We'll do our best estimate, and then we'll haircut it to make sure we come in. And so it's both listings. We had a more conservative view and then we add the conservatism on top of that.
Steve Weber: Tanya, I think this is -- Kyle, this is pretty consistent, right? I mean we did the same last year. And if you look back, I mean, we guided numbers and people expected in 2024, multiple rate cuts that never happened. So we plan for a situation where we were not going to count on something that hasn't happened yet. So we did the same thing here. So frankly, we're probably so far, I mean, our first quarter mortgage probably did better than what we had in our guidance because we were so conservative. So if you plan that way and you guide that way, it gives you a little bit of upside even when things are not as rosy as what the world thinks they might turn out to be.
Kyle Peterson: Okay, that’s helpful color. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question will come from the line of George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
George Tong: Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. With your card and personal loan revenues, they were down 3% year-over-year in the quarter. Can you talk about some of the trends that drove this decline?
Steve Weber: Yes. I mean it's kind of what you see in the industry, right? There's kind of a little bit of a pullback in consumer lending. We also have the underneath our numbers, you might see some mix shifts. So some of the users that are paying a little higher unit cost might be harder hit than some of the bigger operators that are paying a lower unit cost. But yes, 3% is kind of in line with what you're seeing in the industry. I think that typically is a lighter quarter anyway. And I think there's been a conservativeness among the banks in terms of lending. We've seen that in multiple verticals.
George Tong: Got it. That's helpful color. And then going back to the software business, you mentioned seeing lower platform usage in the quarter. Can you talk more about some of the key catalysts that can drive higher usage levels?
Steve Weber: I mean it depends customer by customer. I mean what we saw in some cases in this quarter was that -- and the CCS is on platform, there was just less usage. And that could be a number of different things. I mean in some cases, like I said, sometimes the -- they might reduce usage over the holidays if they don't think there's as much receptiveness of some of those messages or in some cases, they might be pulling back a little bit to save a little bit of money on some things. There's a lot of -- it depends on the customer. But typically, there is some seasonality to that business.
Will Lansing: And George, remember, the CCS product has a collection use case and a fraud use case. That very differently as you go out the year and different customers have -- some of them have collections, some of the fraud, some not both. So those all play factors in depth how the users might go back up.
George Tong: Got it. Helpful. Thank you.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Meuler from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Meuler: Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. Can you just help us kind of understand the typical time line for mapping ACV bookings into ARR.? I get it that there's this usage component. But like are the Q1, Q2 of 2024 ACV bookings kind of flowing into ARR now? Or just like what's the typical timing?
Steve Weber: Yes. I mean it varies. But typically, it's at least 6 months and it's probably more like 9 to 12 months before they're implemented and up and running. So the fact that we had in the last year, early last year, we had lighter bookings that means that you're going to have less new stuff coming online right now? And then that's a result of the bookings we had last year. So the bookings that have -- that we've done in the last couple of quarters, that bodes well for the latter half of this year in terms of more ARR growth. The 6 to 9 month lag between the 2.
Jeffrey Meuler: Got it. And the ARR FX headwind, I think you said it was three points to platform. Was that year-over-year or sequential? And I know you've been asked us a million different ways, but can you help -- well, if we can get that, but can you also just help us with any sort of like quantification of how much of the platform revenue is driven by usage or what it did sequentially the ARR sequential trend for platform is just a pretty striking change.
Steve Weber: Yes. Well, that's on a constant currency basis. So if we had not had changes to the FX, we would have had an extra 3% of ARR this quarter versus last year.
Jeffrey Meuler: Okay, thank you.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra from RBC. Your line is open.
Ashish Sabadra: Thank for taking my question. I had two clarifying questions. First one on the B2B. When we look at the mortgage, auto and card origination revenue, those improved year-on-year compared to fourth quarter, but the overall B2B revenue moderated. So I was just wondering if you can comment on what caused that softness? Is it prescreening or some other revenue stream there within B2B scores?
Steve Weber: Are you talking about Q3 -- or Q4 to Q1, you're sequentially.
Ashish Sabadra: Yes or if you look at the year-on-year growth. Yes, sorry.
Steve Weber: I'm not sure what the -- can you just maybe restate the question. I'm not sure what you -- year-on-year was it's all up.
Ashish Sabadra: Yes. So if I look at mortgage originations, those improved from 95% growth to 110%, auto improved, card improved. But if I look at B2B revenue growth, it was up pretty robust on year-on-year, but it moderated -- the growth moderated from 38% year-on-year in fourth quarter to 30% in the first quarter.
Steve Weber: The 30%, I'm not sure what numbers you're talking about it. There's a significant piece of the business that's not originations, right? So I mean -- and those pieces don't grow anywhere near as fast as some of the origination pieces do. The total B2B was up 30% year-over-year. But a lot of the pieces grew very rapidly, but a lot of things like the prescreen business, the account management business and some of the international pieces are not growing that rapidly. So those pieces can fluctuate if we have a onetime license event with a foreign customer, that might drive a few extra percent of growth in that one quarter, but we didn't have anything in particular like that this year for this quarter.
Ashish Sabadra: Okay. That's helpful. Yes, just from a modeling perspective, we were trying to better understand if there are any other puts and takes to be cognizant of as we look for the rest of the year?
Steve Weber: No. I mean there's always some little -- not always, but a lot of quarters, we have onetime license deals that could be a few million dollars, and some of those could add a couple percent here or there. But those are hard to predict when they're going to happen. So really, the most predictable or most modelable numbers to look at are probably around originations, and those have a bigger impact.
Ashish Sabadra: That's very helpful color. And maybe just a quick one on B2C. It's good to see that inflection in growth there. I was wondering if you could talk about some of the trends that you're seeing on myFICO and how should we think about the growth going forward? Thanks.
Steve Weber: Yes. I mean we're seeing -- obviously, we had some really, really strong growth right during the -- all the refi boom that was happening, and then we had a lot of difficult comps. And now we're seeing that we've kind of cleared those. And there's a lot of -- we've done some investing, and we talked about this on the call last quarter. We're doing some investing on the B2C side. We're doing some different marketing programs. And we think there's a lot of room for growth there. It takes some time to do that. But we're excited about our myFICO business, certainly, and we're investing in that, and we hope to see more growth throughout this year.
Ashish Sabadra: That’s very helpful color. Thanks.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question will come from line of Alexander Hess from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Alexander Hess: Hi, everybody. This is Alex with JPMorgan. So your guide implies about 15% year-on-year revenue growth, which is about where at a consolidated level you ended in 1Q. So not -- so stable from that perspective, you guys flagged that it's conservative and that you guys are confident in the guide. So maybe just thinking outside of mortgage price, are there any new revenue streams that you would call out? I know it's another question on the guide, but everybody is trying to sort of square where this confidence comes from?
Steve Weber: Yes, I mean, I think outside of pricing, there's a lot of -- I mean, even in terms of some of the volume assumptions we have, I mean, there are -- there were some really rough quarters last year in terms of volumes that should -- if not do much better. We think there'll probably be more of a return to normal. So there's a lot of areas we have without going into detail, where we're pretty confident that we were not going to have any trouble clearing our guidance for the rest of the year.
Alexander Hess: Got it. Understood. And then just on the FX side, could you dimension what the impact was to revenue specifically on the software and consolidated side?
Steve Weber: Yes. It was all on the software side essentially. And it was in a few particular currencies, but I think it was around $4 million.
Will Lansing: I'll look for it.
Steve Weber: Yes, you have to get back to me. I don't have the exact number.
Alexander Hess: Understood. Thank you all.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Simon Clinch from Redburn Atlantic. Your line is open.
Simon Clinch: Hi everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to just cycle back to the GSEs. There's been some discussion about the potential for the GSEs when they -- should they go private to start employing sort of some cash flow modeling internally to their own sort of credit scoring capabilities. And I was wondering, one, is that how would that work, first of all? And would FICO still play a part in that kind of scenario, if it would happen.
Will Lansing: I don't know how that would work. It's hard for me to imagine these entities going away from the FICO Score. I mean I think we have a mortgage system in the United States, which is the MV of the world. And the risks are well understood by the investors. The securitization market works a dream. And so it's just very hard for me to imagine them moving away from the FICO Score, which is so effective for supporting the analytics in that market.
Steve Weber: And frankly, they wouldn't be mutual exclusive, right? They would be complementary.
Will Lansing: Yes. And it has been the case. It's always been the place that Fannie and Freddie have their own models. It's not just a score, right.
Steve Weber: Right.
Simon Clinch: Understood. Okay. That's useful. And just a quick follow-up question, just on the mortgage market. I mean, could you give us an indication of the magnitude of volume growth that you did see in the quarter?
Steve Weber: No. We don't detail out the all that. But you can look at reporting that comes from mortgage bankers and other groups to kind of see what those numbers look like.
Simon Clinch: Okay. Thanks so much.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question will come from the line of Scott Wurtzel from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Scott Wurtzel: Hey good afternoon guys. Thank you for taking my questions. I just wanted to go back to the software business. I mean it sounds like you're pretty positive on the forward pipeline. But we if you can kind of dimensionalize sort of how the broader demand environment looks, now that we've kind of turned the calendar to 2025 budgets are reset and just kind of characterize maybe the demand environment and how budgets are looking relative to last year? Thanks.
Will Lansing: We don't see a tremendous amount of change in appetite for our products from a demand side. I think that we're years ago, our point solution applications were under more budget pressure and were the kinds of things that sometimes got deferred. I think that the strategic nature of the platform kind of transcends that. And so not that we're not affected by the fiscal environment of our customers. But it is a high-level decision. It is strategic for our customers. And so we have not experienced a lot of slowdown there.
Scott Wurtzel: Got it. That's helpful. And then just a quick clarification. Just on the Scores margins, we saw kind of a step down there quarter-over-quarter year-over-year with a notable uptick year-over-year in expenses. Just wondering if you can kind of gave a little bit of context around that. Was there anything to do with mix? Anything around that would be helpful.
Steve Weber: No. There's a little bit more spend on the B2C side. So the B2C side has a different cost structure, and we're doing a little bit of investment there and doing some things to -- in terms of marketing.
Scott Wurtzel: Makes sense.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Neill from FT Partners. Your line is open.
Matthew O'Neill: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking my question. A lot of good questions asked and answered, particularly around the guide and outlook for the remainder of the year. So I think maybe we could spend a moment or two digging in further on the press release out today on the study done with a firm and maybe give us a little bit more of a view on the longer-term integration of Buy Now Pay Later into the FICO modeling and how that may sort of develop and so forth. Thank you.
Will Lansing: Well, buy now, pay later, as you know, is popular and growing. The bureaus don't have consistent treatment in terms of how they use it. Is there a caloric value in understanding the consumer repayment behavior on Buy Now, Pay Later? Absolutely. So we've been working with a firm with their data in ours to see how we can extract a little more prediction out of incorporating Buy Now Pay Later data along with other elements of the credit files into the FICO score. And so in the future, we will be doing that. We're pretty excited about it. Any time you can bring alternative data or data that hasn't historically resided in the credit file to the decision, you're going to get a better decision. And so it's -- for us, this is an opportunity for our customers, it's a great thing. It's early days still. I don't think that we have maturity around how the data will be handled across the bureaus. And so we're working on that.
Matthew O'Neill: Got it. Thank you so much. And I guess as a quick follow-up, have any other players in the space volunteered for the invitation in the press release?
Steve Weber: We've been working with the firm for quite a while.
Matthew O'Neill: Got it. Thanks again.
Operator: Thank you. I'm not showing any further questions in the queue. I'd like to turn the call over to David for closing remarks.
Dave Singleton: Yes. Thank you, Victor. I'll just comment on Alex asked a question about FX impact on revenues. So the number was $3 million for total revenue. It's about 1% of total revenue or about 1.5% of software revenue. But overall, thanks, everyone, for attending the earnings call today. Please stay tuned to fico.com and LinkedIn to keep up to date on the latest news as we kick into our FICO World event. Thank you very much.
Unidentified Company Representative: Good bye.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2024 Q4  (2024-11-06 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to FICO's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Dave Singleton. Please go ahead.
Dave Singleton: Good afternoon, and thank you for attending FICO's fourth quarter earnings call. I'm Dave Singleton, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Steve Weber. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison with the prior quarter to facilitate an understanding of the run rate of the business. Certain statements made in this presentation are forward looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these risks and uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, particularly in the risk factors and forward-looking statements portion of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most appropriate comparable GAAP measure. This includes an FY '25 guidance reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings, which are adjusted for items such as stock-based compensation and excess tax benefit. This reconciliation is part of the earnings release included an Exhibit 99.1 to our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC under Item 2.02 titled Results of Operations and Financials. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov, and a replay of this webcast will be available through November 6, 2025. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Will Lansing.
Will Lansing: Thanks, Dave, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. In the Investor Relations section of our website, we've posted some financial highlights slides. We'll be referencing those during our presentation. Today, I'll talk about this quarter's results and our guidance for fiscal '25. We had another fantastic year. We exceeded fiscal '24 guidance on all metrics and delivered strong growth in free cash flow. As shown on Page 2 of the fourth quarter financial highlights, we reported fourth quarter revenues of $454 million, up 16% over last year. For the full fiscal year, we delivered $1.718 billion in revenue, up 13% versus the prior year. We reported $136 million in GAAP net income in the quarter, up 34% and GAAP earnings of $5.44 per share, up 36% from the prior year. For the full fiscal year, we delivered $513 million in GAAP net income, equating to $20.45 of earnings per share, up 19% and 21%, respectively. We reported $163 million in non-GAAP net income in the quarter, up 29% and non-GAAP earnings of $6.54 per share, up 30% from the prior year. For the full fiscal year, we delivered $595 million in non-GAAP net income, which equates to $23.74 of earnings per share, up 19% and 20%, respectively. As shown on Page 10, we delivered record free cash flow of $219 million in our fourth quarter and $607 million over the last four quarters, an increase of 31% year-over-year. We continue to return capital to our shareholders through buybacks. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 188,000 shares at an average price of $1,721 per share. For the fiscal year, we've repurchased 606,000 shares at an average price of $1,366 per share. In our Scores segment, on Page 6 of the presentation, our fourth quarter revenues were $249 million, up 27% versus the prior year. For the full year, our revenues were $920 million, up 19% versus last year. On the B2B side, fourth quarter revenues were up 38% versus the prior year and up 27% for the full year, primarily driven by mortgage originations. On the B2C side, fourth quarter revenues were down 1% versus the prior year and down 2% for the full fiscal year, driven by decreased sales on the myfico.com website. Fourth quarter mortgage originations revenues were up 95% versus the prior year. Mortgage origination revenue accounted for 47% of B2B revenue and 37% of total Scores revenue. Auto originations revenues were down 2%, while credit card, personal loan and other origination revenues were down 5% versus the prior year. Today, we've announced that for calendar 2025, FICO's wholesale royalty will be $4.95 per score for mortgage originations. At this new per score royalty, the amount collected by FICO will remain a small percentage, on average, about 15% of the Tri-Merge bundle cost, which typically runs $80 to well over $100. With total average closing costs of $6,000, FICO's share is only about two-tenth of 1%. As such, it will continue to be the lowest of all individual mortgage closing costs. The FICO Score plays a central role in facilitating about $2 trillion in mortgage originations every year as a critical tool for borrowers, lenders, insurers, investors and other important stakeholders. The royalty collected by FICO is entirely fair and reasonable, and the FICO score continues to deliver incredible value as the most trusted and cost-effective tool used to evaluate consumer credit risk and residential mortgage finance. More information on our new royalty pricing can be found on our website at www.fico.com/blogs, and I would encourage you all to get some more detail on the blog. We continue to drive strong adoption from FICO Score 10 T for the non-GSE mortgages. This quarter, we signed new lenders, including United Wholesale Mortgages, the largest global mortgage lender. We now have clients with over $244 billion in annualized mortgage originations and about $1.33 trillion in eligible mortgage portfolio servicing that have signed up for FICO Score 10 T. Firms are already using 10 T to make credit decisions, for securitization and for delivery to investors. FICO 10 T for conforming mortgages sold in the GSEs will be rolled out based on the timeline of the FAA's implementation of enterprise credit score requirements. Now we continue to innovate in our Scores business. Last week, we announced the upcoming launch of FICO Score mortgage simulator, which enables mortgage professionals to run credit event scenarios by applying simulated changes in an applicant's credit report data to simulate potential changes to the applicant FICO score. This benefits both mortgage lenders and consumers by potentially providing more loan options and more favorable interest rates. In our Software segment, we delivered $205 million in fourth quarter revenue, up 5% from last year, driven mainly by growth in SaaS software, partially offset by a decline in professional services. We delivered $798 million in fiscal year revenue, up 8% from last year. We continued to drive growth in ARR and NRR through our land and expand strategy with expand driven by increased customer usage. As shown on Page 7, the total ARR was up 8%, with platform ARR growing 31% and non-platform ARR flat year-over-year. Total NRR for the quarter, shown on Page 8, was 106% with platform NRR at 123% and non-platform at 99%. ACV bookings for the quarter were $22 million. Our total ACV bookings for the year were $85 million, down 10% year-over-year. While we face some macroeconomic headwinds in the first half of the year, the second half bookings were consistent year-over-year. I am excited about the future of our software business. This quarter, IDC recognized FICO as a leader in the worldwide Decision Intelligence platform market. This is a testament to our commitment to innovation that enables real-time transparent decision-making at scale. We help organizations design, engineer and orchestrate decisions by automating steps in the decision-making process. FICO was recognized for its capabilities and strategy meeting both today's customers' needs and the needs of our customers in the future. We announced two FICO platform partnerships this quarter. We have partnered with Tata Consulting Services, generally known as TCS, a global services integrator and with iSON Xperiences the largest business process outsourcing solutions company in Africa. Both partnerships will leverage FICO platform to create industry-specific solutions for real-time decision making. These partnerships will help us continue to drive strong growth for our platform business. Before I address fiscal '25 guidance, I'll pass it over to Steve to provide some other financial details.
Steve Weber: Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. As Will mentioned, we had another very good quarter with total revenue of $454 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year. Our full year revenue of $1.718 billion was up 13% over last year. Scores segment revenues for the quarter were $249 million, up 27% from the prior year. B2B revenues in that score space were up 38%, driven primarily by mortgage originations revenues. Our B2C revenues were down 1% versus the prior year due to volume declines in our myFICO.com business. For the full year, B2B revenues were $712 million, up 27% and B2C revenues were $208 million, down 2%. Total Scores revenues were $920 million, up 19% despite headwinds in the mortgage originations market. Software segment revenues for the quarter were $205 million, up 5% from the prior year. On-premises and SaaS software revenue grew 8% year-over-year, while professional services declined 9%. Full year software revenues were $798 million, up 8% from the prior previous year. This quarter, 85% of total company revenues were derived from our Americas region, which is a combination of our North America and Latin America regions. Our EMEA region generated 10% of revenues and the Asia Pacific region delivered 5%. Our total software ARR was $720 million -- $721 million, an 8% increase over the prior year. Platform ARR was $227 million, representing 31% of our total Q4 '24 ARR, up from 26% of total Q4 '23 ARR. Platform ARR grew 31% versus the prior year, while non-platform was flat at $494 million this quarter. This aligns with our strategy to focus on FICO platform growth while continuing to retain our non-platform customers. Over time, we do expect migration of these customers to platform products. Our platform land and expand strategy continues to be successful. Our dollar-based net retention rate in the quarter was 106%. Platform NRR was 123%, while our non-platform NRR was 99%. Platform NRR was driven by a combination of new use cases and increased usage of existing use cases. Our software ACV bookings for the quarter were $22 million. ACV bookings for the full year were $85 million. Turning now to expenses for the quarter, as shown on Page 5 of the financial highlights presentation. Our total operating expenses were $257 million this quarter versus $224 million in the prior year, an increase of 15% year-over-year and flat versus the prior quarter. For the full year, our expenses were $984 million versus $871 million in the prior year, an increase of 13%. Our FY '25 guidance assumes lower year-over-year expense growth than in the prior year. We maintain our focus on efficiencies and are committed to prioritizing resources to our most strategic initiatives. We continue to focus investment to accelerate development and distribution of FICO platform, while also investing in Scores resources and marketing. Our non-GAAP operating margin, as shown in our Reg G schedule, was 52% for the quarter compared with 51% in the same quarter last year. We delivered non-GAAP margin expansion of 90 basis points for the full fiscal year. GAAP net income this quarter was $136 million, up 34% from the prior year's quarter. Our non-GAAP net income was $163 million for the quarter, up 29% from the prior year's quarter. For the full year, GAAP net income was $513 million, up 19% versus last year, and non-GAAP net income was $595 million, up 19% versus last year. GAAP earnings per share this quarter were $5.44, up 36% from the prior year. Our non-GAAP earnings per share were $6.54, up 30% from the prior year. For the full year, GAAP earnings per share were $20.45, up 21% from last year, and our non-GAAP earnings per share were $23.74, up 20% from last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.8%. The effective tax rate for the full year was 20.1%, which included $30 million of reduced tax expense from excess tax benefits recognized upon the settlement or exercise of employee stock awards. We believe that our fiscal year 2025 net effective tax rate is expected to be around 22%, while our recurring tax rate is expected to be around 26%. The recurring tax rate is before any excess tax benefit and other discrete items. Free cash flow for the quarter was $219 million, a 35% increase from the previous year. The full year free cash flow was $607 million and was up 31% versus last year. At the end of the quarter, we had $196 million in cash and marketable investments. Our total debt at quarter end was $2.21 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2%. Currently, 59% of our total debt is fixed rate. Our floating rate debt is prepayable at any time and gives us the flexibility to use free cash flow to reduce outstanding floating rate debt balances in future periods. Turning to return of capital. We bought back 188,000 shares in the fourth quarter at an average price of $1,721 per share. We continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. In fiscal 2024, we repurchased 606,000 shares at an average price of $1,366 per share for a total of $828 million. And with that, I'll turn it back to Will to review our fiscal 2025 guidance.
Will Lansing: Thanks, Steve. We continue to execute on our strategy, the proof is in our financial results and customer adoption of both our software and Scores products. Fiscal '24 was a great year. We had our most successful FICO World as we brought together customers and prospective customers from around the globe. We continue to win the trust of our customers with over 100 customers speaking on stage as to how our software helps achieve their goals. We continue to be an industry leader as evidenced by analyst community reports, including IDC, Forrester, Gartner and Chartis. We continue to innovate. At FICO World, we introduced APIs to drive partner channel adoption of FICO Platform. We previewed the upcoming launch of our new FICO Marketplace. In year, we delivered new FICO Platform capabilities, created new IP using responsible AI methods and announced the upcoming launch of FICO Score mortgage simulator. We continued our commitment to financial literacy for both students and adults. We completed the field of dreams, the field of financial empowerment summer tour with Chelsea Football Club and U.S. Soccer Foundation. We hosted Score A Better Future workshops across the U.S., which is just one of FICO's programs that help millions of people gain access to credit. We're well positioned for strong fiscal '25. As we announce our guidance, I'll remind everyone that consistent with prior years, we expect some of the pricing initiatives in 2015 have an additional impact beyond our guidance numbers. And because of uncertainty in volumes, it's difficult to estimate the timing and magnitude of that impact. While macro trends are difficult to predict, our recurring revenues and diversified product portfolio give us considerable visibility into fiscal 2025. With that in mind, we are guiding double-digit growth for both revenue and earnings metrics as shown on Page 13 of the presentation. We are guiding revenues of about $1.98 billion, a 15% year-over-year increase. GAAP net income of about $624 million, an increase of 22%, GAAP EPS of about $25.05, an increase of 23%, non-GAAP net income of approximately $712 million, an increase of 20% and non-GAAP EPS of approximately $28.58, an increase of 20%. With that, I'll turn the call back to Dave to open the Q&A session.
Dave Singleton: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we're now ready to take questions. Operator, please open the lines.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik of Barclays. Your question please, Manav.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. Good evening. Well, thank you for the disclosure and pointing us to the blog as well. I think the whole 0.2% that you've talked about, that's been pretty consistent. I guess just thinking ahead, do you still see more room for that gap to close? I mean, I guess it's 1% the mark?
Will Lansing: Well, we continue to believe that our score delivers tremendous value relative to what we charge. And so yes, I would say that there is still opportunity.
Manav Patnaik: Okay. Good enough. And then, well, I guess, the -- where there's obviously a lot of work and focus on your end is on the software side. And I was just wondering if you could just level set us with, I don't know how you want to think about it, whether what inning you're in and what some of the key initiatives you have planned for this year is on that software side, whether it's maybe more spending to keep investing in the platform? Or just anything there would be helpful.
Will Lansing: I would say that we're still very much in early innings. You can see that with our penetration of what we call enterprise platform customers, EPCs, where we've penetrated a little under half of the top 300 financial institutions globally. So there's still a lot of opportunity for landing the platform with major players with major lending institutions. And that, of course, is before we go down market, that's before we expand through to other verticals. So I'd say it's very, very early innings. That said, we're so far beyond minimum viable products that we're not in inning one. We are along -- far enough along that we have the preeminent platform in the world for decisioning and it is increasingly recognized by players who need it. So that continues to be something really strong for us. I think in terms of investment and when do margins expand, we will continue to invest in the platform. There's certainly a lot more features and functionality that our customers are clamoring for. And as we've discussed in the past, we are investing in indirect sales and distribution. We are investing in an ecosystem that with our open APIs should enable all kinds of players that we don't ordinarily do business with to take advantage of our decisioning IP. So there is this pretty big opportunity still ahead of us, and it does demand some level of investment. All that said, we are in the process of reengineering our platforms for scalability and for margins. And there's no doubt that even if we maintain high R&D spend, which we do today and which will likely continue for some time, our margins ought to improve over time just because we're getting more scale and because we've designed with a view to improving margins through more scale. So I hope that's helpful. Early days, continued investments, but we're going to get more profitable anyway.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you, Will.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind of Jefferies. Please go ahead, Surinder.
Surinder Thind: Thank you. Well, just on the software piece, can you maybe just disaggregate the overall guidance, what your expectations are for the software component and how we should think about maybe platform versus non- platform at this point?
SteveWeber: Yes, thanks for the question, Surinder. We don't guide at that level. We don't guide at the segment level. We just got the total corporate level. So we don't talk about specifics what we expect in Scores versus software and even below that on the software side, we're not -- we don't split out platform versus non-platform. Frankly, it's a little difficult sometimes to even know the difference between platform and non-platform, when we’re early stage with some of these deals that could end up on the platform or could end up in the legacy product as well. So we don't really split that out.
Surinder Thind: Understood. And then in terms of just when I think about the, what I would call the partnerships that you're putting into place, in the process of them trying to build out industry solutions. Any color there you can provide on what specific solutions they may be looking at or what industries they might be looking at, at this point? And then how does that work in terms of the IP sharing that such a relationship might have?
Will Lansing: Sure. It's a good question. I mean, as all of you know, partnerships work best when there's enough economics in it for both sides and where the relationship is complementary and that partners are not competing for the same thing. And so in our partnership with TCS, for example, which is a very strong partnership. We have a number of things going on here. We have tremendous decisioning IP. They have tremendous reach and distribution and professional services and participation in a whole lot of verticals that FICO does not participate in. So they -- we're doing two kinds of things with them. One is they're developing a level of expertise and confidence for implementing our solutions so that it can help our direct customers with implementation because they favor professional services in a way that we do not. And so there's a benefit there. But they're also very interested in providing solutions to their customers, vertical by vertical and leveraging IP. And I think they recognize that our decisioning IP is pretty special. And so they're building solutions around our IP for particular verticals where they have a presence and some expertise. So for example, in the logistics area, TCS is building a proprietary solution based on our decisioning IP. But our intent is to do that and replicate that in other verticals as well.
Surinder Thind: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you, that's it for me.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open George.
George Tong: Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. You're planning to raise mortgage prices by approximately 50% in 2025. Can you discuss how you're thinking about prices for non-mortgage scores in 2025?
Will Lansing: Yes. So first of all, I guess I would point out that at $4.95, that's not a 50% increase, it's less than a 50% increase. But in terms of the other scores prices, as you know, we review the entire portfolio every year and we think about where it's appropriate and fair to raise prices, and we don't do the same thing in every pocket of scores demand. It varies, it varies by year, it varies by segment. And we did apply some increases to non-mortgage. Of course, mortgage isn't the entire business by any means.
George Tong: Okay. Got it. And then broadly, can you talk about how you expect the Trump presidency to impact FICO's operations?
Will Lansing: Yes. That's an obvious kind of a question. And as you can imagine, we think a lot about it. That said, I would just say that we work with both Republican and Democratic administrations, and we've had good success with both and the reason is that we're such a core component of the markets in which we operate, we're so integral to the system that it's really unlikely that Republican or Democratic administrations will do things that the push FICO out of its position in the system. We anticipate that in Trump administration, we'll continue to operate as we have is the cornerstone of the credit lending market in the U.S. And so we look forward to that.
George Tong: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, Faiza.
Faiza Alwy: Yes, hi. Thank you so much. So Will you alluded to some macro uncertainty? And I'm curious if you could elaborate on that? Like are you expecting mortgage volumes to recover in 2025. We are seeing rates a little bit higher. And I'm curious if you can comment on like number of pools that you were seeing per application because there are some indications that those have been declining more recently.
Will Lansing: Well, so with respect to macroeconomic uncertainty, I think that nobody knows what the future holds, not us and not you -- and so we leave it to you to come up with your own estimates on where you think mortgage volumes will be over the coming year. We do anticipate mortgage volumes will increase in the future. But the schedule for that is a little hard to say. And so we've incorporated in our guidance as is typical for us an appropriate level of conservatism. And we'll just have to see how things pan out. In terms of number of pools, we don't really -- we don't have a public pronouncement on that.
Faiza Alwy: Okay. Understood. And then I noticed you've been talking about the value that the FICO score provides to secondary market participants, and I'm curious if you have been thinking about that as a potential revenue opportunity going forward? Do you think there's something there?
Will Lansing: You know that is a very interesting question. There's no doubt that many people who use the FICO Score don't pay for it. Many people use and rely on the FICO Score. Our business model today has historically been built around -- we charge for the first use and then the downstream and subsequent uses when they are permitted by us by contract, tend to be free. Of course, we're in business. And so we think about every kind of variation on a theme, and we thought about trying to put the pricing where the usage is to make sure that you could lower prices in one place and raise them somewhere else, maybe that's more fair. But we also recognize that the system is what it is, and every change has to be scrutinized from the standpoint of what kind of unforeseen consequences and what kind of difficulties might we encounter if we change the system. So it's easy for our strategic thinkers inside FICO to come up with dozens and dozens of variations on how we might price our IP. And trust me, we do. We think about those things, but we're also really mindful of the kind of responsibility that we have to the economy to the community, to our customers, to the participants in the ecosystem and we are loath to make changes that could rattle markets. We don't want to do that. So we're very, very cautious and careful about everything we do. And you've seen that, but that's not to say we don't study it. And if appropriate, we might consider something like that in the future.
Faiza Alwy: Understood, thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Owen Lau of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead, Owen.
Owen Lau: Hi, good afternoon and thank you for taking my questions. And going back to your guidance, could you please maybe add more color on how do you assume how many weight cuts you expect in 2025? And how will that impact the loan volume. Thanks.
Will Lansing: You know that's one of those areas where everybody has a different opinion and we don't publish our opinion. I think you know what our pricing is. And so I think you should apply that to your own best estimates as a guide to making your decisions about what the future holds for us. I don't know that my speculating on how many rate cut is going to be helpful to anyone. I'm not sure that my opinion is worth more than anyone else's.
Owen Lau: Got it. And then on the platform side, some of the analytic firms were under pressure because of the end market challenges and budget cuts and vendor consolidation and things like that. Could you please give us an update on what you're hearing from your clients given that we are going to the year-end budgeting period. Thanks.
Will Lansing: Yes, absolutely. What you point out is something that we used to experience a lot in our applications business five and 10 years ago, where we were very much under budget pressure. And so when our customers were under a lot of budget pressure, the sales cycle stretched out and decisions were postponed and deals were postponed. We see much less of that now. What we see is that the platform is truly a strategic investment by our customers. It tends to be decided at the C-suite level and so I won't say that we're immune to budgetary pressures. But I think that there is this imperative for our customers to make a transition to digital relationships with their consumer customers and they want the kind of power that our platform brings. And their choice is really to try to build it themselves some kind of homegrown solution or to buy it from FICO because there's really not any meaningful competition in terms of features and functionality with our platform. And as between building it in-house and buying the FICO solution, we've invested close to $1 billion in our software business to get to this point. And there are a few customers with the wherewithal to make those kinds of investments. And so any kind of a homegrown solution is just not going to be competitive with what they -- FICO at a fraction of the cost. And so what we see is tremendous adoption of our platform because they do the analysis, and it's a very cost-effective solution, and they get more functionality than they were planning on. They get it much faster than they could if they did it themselves. And so that's really kind of how that decision is going down. So budgetary pressure, who knows, with less budgetary pressure, maybe we'd be doing even better than we are, we can't really say. But we are not experiencing a lot of slowdown because of budget pressures.
Owen Lau: Got it. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Peterson of Needham & Company. Your question please, Kyle.
Kyle Peterson: Great. Hi guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to start off on the Scores revenue this quarter came in really strong. Just wanted to see where there any one-timers. I know in the past, sometimes, you guys have had some licensing deals or royalty true-up. So I just want to see like, is that a clean number? Or was there anything onetime in the 4Q number?
SteveWeber: Yes, there were -- there was a little bit of onetime and there's off, I mean, as you know, most quarters, there's some. There was probably a little bit more than -- certainly than last quarter than this quarter. So there's a few million dollars of additional revenue there. I mean it's nothing all that material in the overall number, but there definitely was a little bit of onetime revenue that we don't necessarily have in our run rate.
Kyle Peterson: Okay. That's helpful, thank you. And then I guess just a follow-up on the mortgage score price rollout. I appreciate the transparency there. Should we think of this as being fully phased in on January 1? Or is there kind of a scheduled phasing or any lag time that we should be mindful of?
SteveWeber: Yes, there's always a lag. It's not scheduled, but there's -- we used to always talk about discord being feathered in, right, the price because some customers are on deals that don't lap on January 1, still might lap later. But -- so it's consistent with every other year we've had essentially.
Kyle Peterson: Okay, thank you. Nice quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Haas of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, Jason.
Jason Haas: Hi, good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. I'm curious if you could talk about what sort of analysis you did to arrive at the $4.95 mortgage score price? Like why did you decide that was the right number to go with? And then I'm also curious, recognize you're not going to go through the details of the pricing for auto and card, but if you could also talk about what sort of analysis you've run to determine what would be the appropriate price for those verticals as well. Thanks.
Will Lansing: There are a lot of factors that go into it. There's not a formula. It's not formulaic, but we look at everything. We do look at volumes. We look at the market. We think a lot about whether the price is fair, whether we're asking our customers to pay a price that exceeds the value that we provide. And we think a lot about those things. And you can probably imagine my view on this, which is that we think it's tremendous value. And so we're fine with where we are. Every year is different. The percentage increases each year are different. The dollar amount increases are different each year. There's not a formula for it. And we sit down in the couple of months before the September 1 rate card gets published to our partners and we think about it. We also have discussions with them. So there's just a lot of factors that go into it.
Jason Haas: Got it, thank you. That's helpful. And then if I could ask a follow-up. On the non-platform business declined slightly, which is a little off trend. I know it's not the focus to grow that, but I was curious if there was anything in particular we should be aware for the quarter there?
Will Lansing: No. There's nothing -- there's nothing there. It's based on volumes. I mean some volumes get a little bit more, a little bit less. It's just volumes and amounted usage we had this quarter.
Jason Haas: That makes sense, thank you.
Will Lansing: It's worth pointing out. I mean, how do we think about that business -- we have this very strong legacy business where we have large market share in a half dozen very important applications for our customers. They typically renew on like a three-year renewal cycle, that's not -- it varies, but it happens often. And we're not in a big hurry to push them to the platform. We have our hands full with new business on the platform. And so as long as we have customers who are happy to renew the legacy products, we're happy with that. And we continue to invest in those legacy products to make sure that the features and functionality are appropriate for today and for tomorrow and for the future. So I think our legacy business is going to be healthy for a very long time to come. We're not really pushing to grow it quickly. And we're also -- we're not in a harvest mode either. We make modest investment to keep it current. And the fluctuation, whether it's a little over 100% or a little below 100% in terms of where we stand. That tends to be volume driven. It tends to be usage by our customers that pushes us there.
Jason Haas: That's very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra of RBC Capital Markets. Your question please, Ashish.
David Paige: Hi, this is David Paige on for Ashish. Thanks for taking our question and congrats on the good results. Two questions. I was wondering if you could talk about the -- if any, competitive dynamics in auto and in card. And then as a follow-up, just a higher level of thinking of what your capital allocation priorities are going to be in 2025. Thank you.
Will Lansing: Okay. So with respect to auto and card, those two businesses look today like they did a year ago and like they did 2 years ago, very little change competitively. Our customers continue to use our products and just not a lot of change there, not a lot of competitive threat, not a lot of new innovation coming from competitors. So really kind of no change there. With respect to capital allocation, our strategy there remains unchanged. As you know, we strive to return capital to our shareholders. We have a very efficient business model. We try to run a pretty efficient balance sheet. We try to manage our leverage to between two and three times and have some level of efficiency there. And it is remarkable to say with a PE north of 100 that we still think our stock is a screaming value, but we really do believe that. And I have -- I've been doing these calls now for 13 years, and every single call, it seems like our stock is at an all-time high, and people wonder why are you still buying back your stock? And to date, it's been a pretty good call. We expect that to continue. We have every intention of returning free cash flow and then some to our shareholders through stock buyback.
David Paige: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Simon Clinch of Redburn Atlantic. Your question please, Simon.
Simon Clinch: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering, well, perhaps you could -- it's quite an important day to be issuing your earnings in the U.S. And I was wondering if you could give some thoughts around really around the FHFA's proposal and implementation of this proposal in the fourth quarter. Do you think anything really changes in terms of the probabilities of that being either delayed or canceled or any thoughts around that would be very useful. Thank you.
Will Lansing: We wonder the same thing, and I think no one knows I don't think it's a secret that the industry has been slow to move on the expected implementation because there are some things that still have to be sorted out. The FHFA has a plan. We're working with them, cooperating with them every way we can to see it happen. But there's no telling what a new administration might do. They -- it's just really hard to say. Maybe things take a little bit longer than they otherwise might have. That's probably the most likely scenario. But there could be a change in direction, one just doesn't know.
Simon Clinch: Okay. That's useful, thanks. And just as a follow-up then, just on the software business, could you provide a little bit more color just around sort of where you are in terms of exploring the investments behind expanding your distribution beyond just your financial -- large financial customers and just where you are with that, please? Thanks.
Will Lansing: Yes. There's a few ways we're going at that. I mean, at the upper end of the ecosystem, we're working with partners. So I mentioned TCS was one, but we're in conversations with a number and have deals with a number of other partners. So the big systems integrators, they are very natural partners for us to get into other verticals. And they have customers, they have distribution, they have skills, they have domain expertise and they can take that, apply it to our IP and provide solutions in these other verticals. And so that's clearly a very efficient way for us to get into kind of more diversified markets. The other thing that we're focused on, which I think is going to take longer is, I wouldn't call it quite a self-service model, but more a self-service model where we have open APIs and ISVs and resellers and VARs have the opportunity to come and leverage our platform and our IP with very little intervention from us. And in the long run, we'd really like to see that flourish. We have a marketplace that we've built to facilitate this. But I think that's going to take time to build.
Simon Clinch: Great, thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Wurtzel of Wolfe Research. Your question please, Scott.
Scott Wurtzel: Thanks, good afternoon, guys. Just first one on the ACV bookings trends. I know historically, we usually see a sequential step-up from 3Q to 4Q. And I thought the number was still pretty good. But just wondering, was there any maybe pull forward of bookings into the third quarter that is maybe distorting that seasonal trend a little bit?
SteveWeber: Yes. I mean there's really no reason for a seasonal trend. Typically, a lot of times it does happen that our fourth quarter is higher. But if you look at this year, our third and fourth quarter was exactly the same number, give or take, as the third and fourth quarter combined last year. So there probably was some pull forward on some deals from our fourth quarter this year into the third quarter. And there have been some deals last year that pushed from the third and fourth quarter. So it's hard to really look at any one specific quarter that way.
Scott Wurtzel: Got it. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, just on your guidance, wondering if you can maybe help us understand how you're thinking about investments and expense growth in fiscal year '25. Thanks.
SteveWeber: Yes. When you see it built into -- if you -- we gave you all the numbers basically, you kind of see what our expense elevate looks like. But as we said, the expense growth that's built into the guidance is a lower growth rate than what we saw in '24. We have some kind of onetime things happening in '24, both non-repeating some benefits we got last year and then some onetime as we paid for this year as well. So there's some growth built into the expenses, but it's less than what we had this year. And then it's less than what our top line revenue growth. So we'll get margin expansion out of that. And then if we -- if we're able to beat guidance throughout the year, usually that comes along in a pretty decent margin. So there's a little bit of expense growth that comes with additional revenue, but that would come at a much higher margin profile as well.
Scott Wurtzel: Got it. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Stein of FT Partners. Please go ahead, Andrew.
Andrew Stein: Hi, thank you. I just have one question tonight. Could you at least provide some color on the volume trends within scores when the 30-year mortgage was closer to 6% in the back half of September relative to the rest of the quarter? Thanks.
SteveWeber: Yes. I mean the best source for data for that is actually just look at what the NBA publishes. That's what we look at. That's actually more realtime than the numbers that we see. So we can't really track it on a week-by-week basis like they do. So I would push you to that, first of all. But we did see -- we saw some upticks when the rate came down and then we saw it slow down a little bit. And it's hard to really draw much of a trend from any of that. So we're -- obviously, we're very conservative with the way we guide going forward.
Andrew Stein: Got it, appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McVay of UBS. Please go ahead, Kevin.
Kevin McVeigh: Great, thank you so much. Could you give us a sense of with the 2025 pricing, how much of that is factored into the guidance already just directionally? And is there anything from '24 that's factored into the '25 guidance? I guess, any sense of just how that phases, maybe anything that didn't occur in '24 in the '25 and '25 more broadly?
Will Lansing: Yes. I think that the two things going on there. One is the new pricing each year goes into effect on Jan 1, but our fiscal runs from October 1 to September 30. So obviously, there's a 1-quarter discrepancy in the pricing -- and when the pricing gets, so that's one factor that influences it. And then the other, as Steve mentioned earlier, is a lot of our channel partner customers have multiyear deals. And so -- and when they do, we honor the prices from prior years. And so that's another thing that can affect that relationship.
Kevin McVeigh: Very helpful, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the Q&A portion of our call and our conference for today. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-07-31 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Third Quarter 2024 FICO Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Dave Singleton. Please go ahead.
Dave Singleton: Good afternoon, and thank you for attending FICO's third quarter earnings call. I'm Dave Singleton, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Steve Weber. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. And on this call, management will also discuss results in comparison with the prior quarter to facilitate an understanding of the run rate of the business. Certain statements made in this presentation are forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these risks and uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, particularly in the risk factors and forward-looking statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. And a replay of this webcast will be available through July 31, 2025. Now I will turn the call over to our CEO, Will Lansing.
Will Lansing: Thanks, Dave, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. In the Investor Relations section of our website, we posted some financial highlights slides that we will be referencing during our presentation. Today, I'll talk about this quarter's results and our increased guidance for the full fiscal year. We continue to deliver strong quarterly results, including impressive growth in our ACV bookings and free cash flow. As shown on Page 2 of the third quarter financial highlights, we reported Q3 revenues of $448 million, up 12% over the last year. We delivered $126 million of GAAP net income in the quarter, down 2% and GAAP earnings of $5.05 per share, down 1% from the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, Q3 net income was $156 million with earnings of $6.25 per share, up 9% and 10%, respectively. We had a difficult comp in year-over-year net income as Q3 of 2023 included an $8.5 million onetime reimbursement of third-party data implementation costs as well as a $9.5 million reduction in income tax expense associated with the valuation of our R&D credits. We delivered record free cash flow of $206 million in our third quarter and $551 million over the last four quarters. We continue to return capital to our shareholders through buybacks. In Q3, we repurchased 196,000 shares at an average price of $1,293 per share, and we announced a new Board authorization for $1 billion of share repurchase. In our Scores segment on Page 6 of the presentation, our third quarter revenues were $241 million, up 20% versus the prior year. Breaking that down, in B2B, current quarter revenues were up 27% versus the prior year. In B2C, the current quarter revenues were down 2% versus the prior year. Third quarter mortgage originations revenues were up 80% versus the prior year. Mortgage origination revenue accounted for 49% of B2B revenue and 39% of total Scores revenue. Auto originations revenues were down 3%, while credit card, personal loan and other originations revenues were down 7% versus the prior year. We continue to drive strong adoption for FICO Score 10-T for non-GSE mortgages. Based on 2023 firm reported data, clients with over $126 billion in annualized mortgage originations and about $380 billion in eligible mortgage portfolio servicing have signed up for the FICO Score 10-T. Firms are using FICO 10-T to make credit decisions, delivered to investors and for securitization. FICO 10-T for conforming mortgages will be rolled out based on the time line of the FHFA's implementation of enterprise credit score requirements. In our Software segment, we delivered $206 million in Q3 revenue, up 5% and from last year, driven mainly by growth in SaaS software, partially offset by a decline in professional services. We continue to drive strong growth in ARR and NRR through our land and expand strategy with expand driven by increased customer usage. As shown on Page 7, total ARR was up 10%, with platform ARR growing 31% and non-platform ARR growing 3%. Total NRR for the quarter shown on Page 8, was 108%, with platform NRR at 124% and non-platform NRR at 101%. Our total ACV bookings for the quarter were an impressive $27.5 million. We continue to drive more FICO platform SaaS bookings, which aligns with our strategy. We expect this trend to continue as our recent FICO World event has been a catalyst for driving pipeline growth, especially for the FICO platform. I'm very proud of the strength of our software business, both the industry-leading technology as well as our remarkable team. This quarter, we secured another award for our FICO platform, the business intelligence platform in the year from data breakthrough. In July, Nikhil Behl was promoted to EVP for software, leading all technology and go-to-market functions. Nikhil has been instrumental in strengthening our brand value, reputation with customers and regulators, strategic competitive positioning for FICO scores and FICO platform and market-leading business growth. We continue to excel in our Scores business as well. Our team is focused on innovation to provide new ways to add value for our customers. FICO scores a tool that market participants rely on to make many crucial decisions, including prequel [ph] underwriting, pricing, ensuring, securitizing, rating, selling, assessing capital requirements, assessing prepayment risk and determining collection strategies. The FICO Score has long been freely chosen because it's trusted as the most predictive and reliable independent credit score, enabling lenders to fairly expand credit access to more consumers. The FICO Score was widely adopted because it democratized and expanded access to credit while simultaneously underpinning the safety and soundness of the market. It's worth pointing out that over half of mortgage market is not conforming and also overwhelmingly uses FICO scores. The FICO Score is provided and will continue to provide tremendous value to the credit ecosystem. As part of our ongoing commitment to industry-leading credit decision, we've made significant commitments to financial knowledge and financial inclusion. We've once again partnered with Chelsea Football Club, both men's and women's teams and U.S. Soccer Foundation for the field of financial empowerment summer tour. The goal is to build excitement for and access to financial education and resources to help more people, including the next generation of fans make more informed credit decisions. As part of the campaign, FICO host free score a better future fundamentals, financial education workshops for students from traditionally underserved communities. Students improve financial literacy and have the opportunity to attend a Chelsea football game. I'll talk about our outlook for the balance of the year, including our increased guidance after Steve provides further financial details.
Steve Weber: Thanks, Will and good afternoon everyone. As Will mentioned, we had another good quarter with total revenues of $448 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year. Score segment revenues for the quarter were $241 million, up 20% from Q3of 2023. B2B revenues were up 27%, driven primarily by mortgage origination revenues. Our B2C revenues were down 2% versus the prior year due to volume declines in our on myFICO.com business. Software segment revenues in the third quarter were $206 million, up 5% versus Q 32023. On prem and SaaS, software revenue grew 7% year-over-year, while professional services declined 9%. This quarter. 85% of total company revenues were derived from our Americas region, which is the combination of our North America and Latin American regions. Our EMEA region generated 10% of revenues and the Asia Pacific region generated 5%. Our total software ARR was $710 million, a 10% increase over the prior year. Platform ARR was $215 million, representing 30% of our total Q3 '24 ARR, up from 25% of total in of 2023. Platform ARR grew 31% versus the prior year, while non platform ARR grew 3% to $495 million this quarter. Our platform land and expand strategy continues to be successful. Our dollar based net retention rate in the quarter was 108%. Platform NRR was 124% while our non platform NRR was 101%. Platform NRR was driven by a combination of new use cases and increased usage. Our software ACV bookings for the quarter were $27.5 million. As a reminder, ACV bookings include only the annual value of software sales and exclude professional services. Our expenses for the quarter - total operating expenses were $258 million this quarter versus $220 million $2 million in the prior year and the increase of 16% year-over-year and 8% versus the prior quarter. Our third quarter included our FICO World event and a true up for our annual incentive rewards, and we expect Q4 expenses to be down modestly from our Q3 run rate. As Will noted, the prior year includes an $8.5 million one time reimbursement of third party data implementation costs and a reduction to income tax expense of $9.5 million associated with the valuation of our R&D tax credits. Our non GAAP operating margin, as shown in our Reg-G schedule was 52% for the quarter, compared with 51% in the same quarter last year. GAAP net income this quarter was $126 million, down 2% from the prior year's quarter. Our non GAAP net income was $156 million with a quarter of 9% from the prior year's quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.5%. We believe that our fiscal year 2024, net effective tax rate is expected to be around 22%, while our recurring tax rate is expected to be around 26%. The recurring tax rate is before any excess tax benefit and other discrete items. Free cash flow for the quarter was $206 million, a 69% increase from the previous year. The trailing 12 month free cash flow was $551 million compared to $467 million in the prior quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had $199 million in cash and marketable investments. Our total debt at quarter end was $2.13 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 5.3%. Currently, 61% of our total debt is fixed rate. Our floating rate debt is prepayable at any time, giving us the flexibility to use free cash flow to reduce outstanding floating rate debt balances in future periods. During the quarter, we secured a $450 million term loan and used those proceeds to reduce our revolving line of credit and to provide additional debt capacity. Turning to return of capital. We bought back 196,000 shares in the third quarter at an average price of $1,293 per share. That exhausted the existing board authorization, which was approved in January, and we have just announced a new Board authorization for $1 billion. We continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. And with that, I'll turn it back to Will for his thoughts on the rest of the year and the increase in our full year guidance.
Will Lansing: Thanks, Steve. We are executing on our strategy. Our customers are delighted with our innovative products. Our execution is generating strong financial results, including impressive ACV bookings, record free cash flow and an increase in FICO platform and FICO 10-T adoption. The business is strong. I'm pleased to report that today, we're again raising our full year guidance as we enter the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. We're raising our full year revenue guidance to $1.70 billion. GAAP net income is now expected to be $500 million with GAAP earnings per share of $19.90. Non-GAAP net income is now expected to be $582 million, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $23.16. With that, I'll turn it back to Dave, and we'll open up the Q&A session.
Dave Singleton: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we're now ready to take questions. Operator, please open the line.
Operator: Thank you. And our first question is going to come from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Faiza Alwy: Yes. Hi. Thank you so much. So I wanted to start with the software business and just ask you if you could comment on the selling environment. If there's any change from a macro perspective, anything new or different you're hearing from your customers? And then I know at FICO World, we had talked about improvement of the platform and talking about decomposition of the platform. So just give us a sense of if there's any update there and any additional color?
Will Lansing: FICO World is always and was this year the biggest pipeline generating event that we have. And so we came out of FICO World with a very, very healthy pipeline. I would say that the selling environment has not changed that much over the last year or so. And I would also emphasize that increasingly, customers are buying FICO software as a strategic move. And so it's a very considered purchase. And it's not just like going out and finding a point solution to a small problem, to a specific problem. It's a bigger thing than that. And that hasn't changed. That's kind of the new way of operating.
Faiza Alwy: Got it. Thank you. And then just a question on mortgage revenues. You obviously had very strong growth in the quarter. I'm curious how volume trended in the quarter? I know you don't give a breakdown, but was it in line with your expectations? Are there any dynamics you're seeing around soft fold where I believe lenders have the option to go to one or two bureaus like that? Are you seeing an impact on volumes from that and just the general environment around more...
Will Lansing: Our mortgage volumes are a lagging indicator relative to other mortgage data that you have. Our mortgage volumes are down versus a year ago, they're pretty much flat versus a quarter - last quarter. And then none of that is particularly surprising.
Faiza Alwy: All right. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. And one moment as we move on to our next question. And our next question is going to come from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Surinder Thind: Thank you. First question on just the guidance raise. It implies revenues are going to be down roughly $10 million quarter-over-quarter. Just any color there? I know you normally are conservative in the guide, but just can you do the walk for us from 3Q to fiscal...
Steve Weber: Yes. So we are pretty conservative with the way we guide. So we want to make sure that a lot of the -- on the Scores, we don't have much control over, right? So we don't really know what's going to happen there. I would say that generally, the fourth quarter is a little lighter seasonally for mortgage. Mortgage volumes aren't as high, typically then as they are in the spring. So there might be some -- a little bit of volume decline there, but a lot of it just spends in the environment which we don't have a lot of visibility to.
Surinder Thind: Thank you. And then in terms of just when I think about the non-platform business here. The NRR was 101%. That's the slowest pace of growth in about 2 years. So any color there that you can help with? Is there some movement of revenues from non-platform to platform at this point? How should we think about that?
Will Lansing: I wouldn't say that it's cannibalization if that's what your question is getting at. We're pretty pleased with our classic offerings with 101% NRR. We've been trying to manage that business in this relatively flat way, and we're pleased that it's turning out that way. But as you can see, the growth is on the expand side on the platform. It's -- we don't -- we let the market tell us what it wants, but we're not displeased with the way it's shaking out.
Steve Weber: Yes. And I would say, I mean, we had higher numbers last year. And at the time, we said there were some things driving that. Some of it was some of the CPI increase that we had. And we had some advantages last year from some FX as well. And we knew that we're not going to maintain this year. So it's kind of what we thought was going to happen, it would settle more to around 100%.
Surinder Thind: Okay. Thank you. I'll get back in the queue for additional questions.
Operator: Thank you. And one moment as we move on to our next question . And our next question is going to come from the line of Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Scott Wurtzel: Hey, good afternoon, guys, and thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to start on the auto origination side. Revenue is down 3% versus modestly up last quarter. Just wondering, similar to how you did a mortgage, maybe comment on the volumes there and how they trended versus last quarter?
Will Lansing: Yes, volumes were relatively flat, but there really is a mix shift. So we had more of a mix shift to more market share in the peers that are a little bit less price for us. Unit cost is a little bit lower. So that's really the difference between the volume and the revenue. So the price per score went down slightly because of a mix shift.
Scott Wurtzel: Got it. That's helpful. And then on the software side, on the platform ARR, I mean, I think it's pretty good to see the sort of rate of deceleration moderate from 2Q to 3Q at sort of this low 30s level. I mean, do you kind of see this as a sort of sustainable growth rate for platform ARR over the near to medium term here?
Will Lansing: Probably, yes. I mean we don't -- we think we're pretty confident in that at around that rate. It can change as we go out further, but we think that's a sustainable rate. And we've got -- it helps when you have a good quarter like this in terms of signing new deals, too, because that will help boost the ARR in the future. So we don't have really good visibility to because a lot of it depends on how quickly our customers can get online and how much usage they have, but there's a lot of growth there. So we're pretty confident that we can maintain these levels.
Scott Wurtzel: Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And one moment as we move on to our next question. And our next question is going to come from the line of Kyle Peterson with Needham. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Kyle Peterson: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. I just wanted to start out on software, particularly the bookings looked pretty nice on an ACV basis, come a lot of the prior quarters. So how should we think about some of the implementation cycles and kind of when some of those bookings will start to translate to revenue here?
Will Lansing: Well, it's -- as you know, it's a long sales cycle as long as 400 days, and it takes not that long to get live once it's all said and done. But I think that the flow-through is the subsequent year. I mean that's the easiest way to think about it.
Steve Weber: Yes. And it does depend on the customer, how sophisticated they are, how ready they are. But yes, I mean, if you sign deals now in the next 6 to 9 months, you should start seeing a flow-through on that.
Kyle Peterson: Got it. That's very helpful. And then just a follow-up on -- particularly on if we do get rate cuts, whether it's later this year or next year, maybe if you could walk us through some of the different sensitivities. I know your business now looks quite a bit different maybe compared to past cycles. So especially in those first one to two rate cuts, what are some of the impacts that we should be mindful of if those do come to fruition?
Will Lansing: We're already seeing a little bit of an uptick in refi and it's not exactly a gigantic leap of faith that as rates come down, we'll see volumes go up. We fully anticipate that. Your guess is as good as ours as to the timing of the rate cuts. We would hope to see some rate cuts towards the end of this year and next year and volumes go up with that.
Kyle Peterson: All right, that's helpful. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And one moment as we move on to our next question. And our next question is going to come from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
George Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Within the Scores business, card and personal loan revenue fell 7% in the quarter, which is a little bit better than the 9% decline in the prior quarter. Can you talk about some of the trends you're seeing among subprime or lower tier consumers that may be impacting card and personal loan performance and also talk about overall bank lending conditions?
Will Lansing: Yes. I mean the subprime markets obviously seem the biggest pullback, which is not surprising, right? You're late in the credit cycle, you have a lot more uncertainty, and that's kind of where you see that happen first. Bank by bank, it kind of varies depending on what they're looking at and what kind of what kind of campaigns they might -- may or may not be running. But we see banks being relatively conservative with new originations. And I think we're kind of waiting to see what happens and see what the economic environment looks like. So it's really not surprising. We saw probably a little over a year ago, strong growth there when mortgage started to slow down and rates start to go up, we saw strong growth there. But now I think there's just more uncertainty in the market, and they're just kind of being more cautious in their originations.
George Tong: Got it. That's helpful. And then switching to the software side, software operating margins contracted about 430 bps year-over-year in the quarter. Can you talk about some of the reasons behind that...
Will Lansing: It's almost completely around that reimbursement we had last year. So that was a big number we had, and that was all on the software side. So that's the driver of that.
George Tong: And so as that lapse, when would you expect to flip to margin expansion in the software business?
Will Lansing: Well, we'll get some margin expansion next quarter because, I mean, again, we had some costs at FICO World this quarter was not going to repeat next quarter. So we'll have some -- our costs will decline next quarter, and that will end up with some margin expansion. We -- these costs are big enough where any one given quarter, something like FICO is going to have an impact on that quarter's margin.
George Tong: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And one moment as we move on to our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Ashish Sabadra: Thanks for taking the question. Just on the software revenue growth, particularly the on-prem and SaaS. And within that, when I look at software recognized over the contract term, the growth there moderated. How should we think about the growth profile there?
Will Lansing: Ashish, we can't hear you. We can't hear you.
Ashish Sabadra: Sorry. Let me know better. Yes. So I wanted to focus on the on-prem and SaaS software revenue growth. And within that, even the software recognized over contract term that moderated a bit, still pretty strong at 80%, but did moderate from mid-teens. How should we think about those puts and takes on the revenue growth going forward?
Will Lansing: Yes. I mean a lot of that is the fact that we had the Omega growth the non-platform growth to what we saw last year. So that right there drives most of the -- and obviously, the platform side is growing 50% either. But -- so we think these kind of growth rates going forward, as I said earlier, that's probably more likely, but we're going to see it continue. And as the numbers get bigger, it's harder to drive 50% growth, 3% to 4% growth. So we're pretty happy with the 30% growth on the platform side and on the non-platform we think we can get better than 100%. We're happy with that as well.
Ashish Sabadra: That's very helpful. Thanks. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And one moment as we move on to our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Simon Clinch with Redburn Atlantic. Your line open. Please go ahead.
Simon Clinch: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to cycle back to the 3%0 plus growth in the platform software ARR. And just -- I was wondering if you could just give in a little bit more detail as to why you think that, that is a sustainable level of growth? And just perhaps flesh that out a little bit more for us, please?
Will Lansing: Well, I mean, we've got -- I mean, again, we had a really good quarter with new bookings, and we've got a lot of installed base that's rapidly expanding. I mean when we install most of our customers look for new ways to use it, and we see that in the net retention rate. And that's -- that number continues to be do well, and we continue to add more business to it. So we can't guarantee it, but we've got a lot of reasons, both data-driven and anecdotally to think that we're going to continue to see that kind of growth.
Simon Clinch: Okay. Thanks. And just to follow up on that. Could you -- I mean, just frame the approach to pricing within the software business. You mentioned last year in the, I think it was the non-platform side, you had sort of higher inflationary pricing. But just wondering if you could talk a bit about the strategy around the pricing, pricing value and how to think about that going forward?
Will Lansing: Our strategy around software pricing is -- we're very focused right now on making our software accessible and encouraging adoption. And so while there's probably room for value pricing in our software business, that's not where our direction is. Our direction is to put the software in the hands of our customers and then watch revenue grow as their usage increases. And the usage increases within the initial applications that they put the platform to use for. And then also, as they discover new uses, the expand part of our land expand strategy is very much wrapped around the customer taking control of what they can do with the platform and coming up with new use cases. And we tend to design in a way that we don't have to renegotiate contracts and go back and do a lot of contractual work for them to do more revenue with us. we tend to design it in a way that they can select how much usage they want and our revenue goes up automatically as their usage goes up.
Simon Clinch: Thank so much. Appreciate it.
Operat0: Thank you. And one moment as we move on to our next question. And our next question is going to come from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Jeff Meuler: Yeah, thanks. Instead of me getting to ask a question about cash flow this quarter, I just got to say congrats on the nice cash flow. Can you give us some perspective on the geographic kind of trends within software? And I guess it looks like America's revenue was down a little year over year. So any particular call outs? And then EMEA was up a lot. So just any mega wins in EMEA or any reason to think that you're at an inflection point there and it's really taking off.
Will Lansing: You know, Jeff, I don't think that we have tremendous changes regionally. I wouldn't try to read too much into the data on a quarterly basis. We have strength of platform across all the regions. I think Asia Pacific was a little behind the other regions in terms of platform adoption, and there were some structural reasons for that. For example, AWS was not available in India before and now it is. But we're seeing adoption across all the regions. Yes, I would think some of what you see might see with the volatility is when we have that point-in-time license revenue, and that could skew things in one given quarter. But we've had a lot of adoption in the last year in North America, and we're starting to see a lot more interest to in EMEA as well.
Jeff Meuler: And then when you're calling out the FICO 10-T adoption and then the nonperforming mortgage market, is that almost exclusively about upgrades from prior versions of the FICO score given how high your penetration is? Or are you finding, I guess, like incremental volume as part of that adoption?
Will Lansing: It's a bit of both, but probably more of the upgrade.
Steve Weber: Yes. I mean for the most part, everybody was using the traditional FICO scores and now they're just moving to the 10-k [ph] ahead of the adoption by the FHFA.
Jeff Meuler: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question is going to come from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. Good evening. I just wanted to ask, Will, I think you tried to reference some of these in your prepared remarks, but in the face of some public criticism around the price of your scores, how is your approach of high process around the value of your score? Maybe the timing around which you get to that value, has that changed at all?
Steve Weber: Well, you've heard us say in the past, and I certainly continue believe that what in charge to the FICO of you have some public criticism around the price of your stores. Like how is your approach or thought process, Our thought process sis that over time, we're going to close some of that gap. And I think anyone who actually studied the numbers and gets into the details of it, sees the FICO scores are a tiny piece of the overall process, whether you're talking mortgage or any other kind of credit evaluation process. And so I would say no, no real change anticipated.
Manav Patnaik: Okay. And then somewhat similarly, on the software side, I think you talked about that value proposition being unique and niche, et cetera. But we've heard obviously a lot of other software companies during learning season talk about the weak environment and the slowdown. It doesn't sound like you're seeing any of that, but anything you'd like to call out? Was there may be some -- could it be a lag that you see some of these headwinds or perhaps you're not seeing that at all?
Steve Weber: We're really not seeing that. That's not -- I mean, we've certainly heard that and I guess the industry is experiencing that, but we haven't felt that.
Manav Patnaik: Okay, fair enough. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Thank you. This will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Ladies and gentlemen, this will also conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day. Goodbye.+

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-04-25 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Fair Isaac second quarter earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.
 I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Dave Singleton. Please go ahead. 
Dave Singleton: Good afternoon, and thank you for attending FICO's second quarter earnings call. I'm Dave Singleton, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Steve Weber.
 Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison with the prior quarter to facilitate an understanding of the run rate of the business.
 Certain statements made in this presentation are forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these risks and uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, particularly in the Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements portion of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team.
 This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. And a replay of this webcast will be available through April 25, 2025.
 I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Will Lansing. 
William Lansing: Thanks, Dave, and thanks, everyone, for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. In the Investor Relations section of our website, we posted some financial highlights slides that we'll be referencing during our presentation today.
 Today, I'll talk about this quarter's results and our increased guidance for the full fiscal year. We again delivered strong results, demonstrating the resiliency of our business with solid growth both in Scores and in Software.
 As shown on Page 2 of the second quarter financial highlights, we reported Q2 revenues of $434 million, up 14% over the last year. We delivered $130 million of GAAP net income in the quarter, up 28%. We delivered GAAP earnings of $5.16 per share, up 29% from the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, Q2 net income was $154 million with earnings of $6.14 per share, up 27% and 29%, respectively. We delivered free cash flow of $62 million in our second quarter and $182 million in the first half of fiscal '24.
 We continue to return capital to our shareholders through buybacks. In Q2, we repurchased 144,000 shares at an average price of $1,246 per share. We have $367 million remaining on our Board repurchase authorization.
 Now in our Scores segment, on Page 6 of the presentation, our second quarter revenues were $237 million, up 19% versus the prior year. In B2B, the current quarter revenues were up 28% versus the prior year. On the B2C side, the current quarter revenues were down 4% versus the prior year.
 Second quarter mortgage originations revenues were up 85% versus the prior year. Mortgage origination revenue accounted for 46% of B2B revenue and 36% of total Scores revenue. Auto originations revenues were down 1%, while credit card, personal loan and other originations revenues were down 9% versus the prior year.
 We continue to drive strong adoption for FICO Score 10 T for nonconforming mortgages. Since 2023, clients with over $100 billion in annualized mortgage originations and about $300 billion in eligible mortgage portfolio servicing have signed up for the FICO Score 10 T. FICO 10 T for conforming mortgages will be rolled out based on the time line of the FHFA.
 In our Software business, we delivered $197 million in Q2 revenue, up 8% from last year, driven by growth in on-premises and SaaS software, partially offset by a decline in professional services. We continue to drive strong growth in ARR and NRR through our land-and-expand strategy, with expand driven by increased customer usage.
 As shown on Page 7, total ARR was up 14%, with platform ARR growing 32% and nonplatform ARR growing 8%.
 Total NRR for the quarter, shown on Page 8, was 112%. Platform NRR was 126%, and nonplatform NRR was 106%.
 Our total ACV bookings for the quarter were $17 million. Our pipeline remains strong, especially with platform offerings.
 Before I turn it over to Steve to talk about financial detail, I'd like to take a few moments to talk about the FICO World event we hosted last year -- last week. The 4-day event included 1,200 attendees, representing more than 400 companies from 60 countries. FICO World brought together customers and prospective customers from around the globe to discuss the benefits of making real-time decisions at scale through the power of the FICO platform.
 Current customers explained the benefits of improved profits, increased customer acquisition and retention, reduced costs, growth in new product offerings and improved employee efficiency. Through FICO platform demonstrations in our innovation center, customers experienced real examples of the variety of use cases that can be deployed using the FICO platform.
 At FICO World, we announced several innovations. We responded to market demand with an open API framework, a FICO marketplace open ecosystem and business composability. Together, these innovations foster a more collaborative environment by reducing silos and creating transparency into future outcomes.
 Some of the content from FICO World will be available in the coming weeks on our YouTube channel. I'd encourage all of you to view the demonstrations and presentations to better understand our customers' excitement around this innovative technology.
 I'll talk about our outlook for the balance of the year, including our increased guidance, but first, let me turn it to Steve for further details. 
Steven Weber: Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. As Will mentioned, we had another very good quarter with total revenue of $434 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year. Scores segment revenues for the quarter were $237 million, up 19% from Q2 of 2023. B2B revenues were up 28% driven primarily by mortgage originations revenues. Our B2C revenues were down 4% versus the prior year due to volume declines in our myFICO.com business.
 Software revenues in the second quarter were $197 million, up 8% versus Q2 2023. On-premises and SaaS software revenue grew year-over-year, while professional services revenues declined.
 This quarter, 84% of total company revenues were derived from our Americas region, which is a combination of our North America and Latin America regions. Our EMEA region generated 10% of revenues, and the Asia Pacific region delivered 6%.
 Our total software ARR was $697 million, a 14% increase over the prior year. Platform ARR topped $200 million this year for the first time at $201 million and represented 29% of our total Q2 ARR, up from 25% of the total in Q2 of 2023. Platform ARR grew 32% versus the prior year, while nonplatform ARR grew 8% to $496 million this quarter.
 Our platform land-and-expand strategy continues to be very successful. Our dollar-based net retention rate in the quarter was 112%. Platform NRR was 126%, while our nonplatform NRR was 106%. Platform NRR was driven by a combination of new use cases and increased usage. Nonplatform was driven by customers' increased usage and by CPI price increases.
 Our software ACV bookings for the quarter were $16.8 million. As a reminder, ACV bookings include only the annual value of Software sales and exclude professional services.
 Turning to expenses. Our total operating expenses were $239 million this quarter versus $221 million in the prior year. Our current expenses are a 4% increase over the prior quarter. As we indicated last quarter, we maintained focus on investments to accelerate development of the FICO platform, and that incremental investment is relatively modest and built into our guidance.
 Our non-GAAP operating margin, as shown in our Reg G schedule, was 53% for the quarter, and that represents a 400 basis point increase from the same quarter last year.
 GAAP net income this quarter was $130 million, up 28% from the prior year's quarter. Our non-GAAP net income was $154 million for the quarter, up 27% in the prior year's quarter.
 The effective tax rate for the quarter was 25%. We believe that our fiscal year 2024 net effective tax rate is expected to be around 22%, while our recurring tax rate is expected to be around 26%. And as a reminder, the recurring tax rate is before any excess tax benefit and other discrete items that were recognized.
 Free cash flow for the quarter was $61.6 million, a 30% decrease from the prior year. The trailing 12-month free cash flow was 457% -- $457 million compared to $494 million in the prior quarter. We do expect free cash flow to accelerate from the Q2 level in the next 2 quarters.
 At the end of the quarter, we had $177 million in cash and marketable investments.
 Our total debt at quarter end was $2.04 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2%. Currently, [ 63% ] of our total debt is fixed rate. Our floating rate debt is prepayable at any time, giving us the flexibility to use free cash flow to reduce outstanding floating rate debt balances in future periods.
 In terms of return of capital, we did buy back 144,000 shares in the second quarter at an average price of $1,246 per share. And at the end of the quarter, we still had $367 million remaining on the Board authorization.
 And with that, I'll turn it back to Will for his thoughts on the rest of the year and to give the information on our increase in the full year guidance. 
William Lansing: Thank you, Steve. Our strategy remains consistent despite an uncertain macroeconomic environment. We're experiencing strong growth in our Scores business, even as the current rate environment has driven volumes lower.
 Throughout our business, we continue to invest in innovation. This is particularly evident as we see growing customer adoption and expanded use cases of FICO platform. Our customers are delighted to be able to optimize interactions with their end customers through data-driven, composable solutions that are executed in real time.
 I'm pleased to report that today, we're raising our full year guidance as we enter the second half of our fiscal year. We're raising our full year revenue guidance to $1.69 billion. GAAP net income is now expected to be $495 million, with GAAP earnings per share of $19.70. Non-GAAP net income is now expected to be $573 million, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $22.80.
 With that, I'll turn the call back to Dave to open the Q&A session. 
Dave Singleton: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we're now ready to take questions. Operator, please open the lines. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. 
Manav Patnaik: Maybe I'll just start with the Software segment first, Will. Clearly, we were at FICO World and your comments -- both are pretty bullish. But can you just help us appreciate or understand the second quarter in a row of deceleration on the platform side? I think last quarter, you said there were some movement in the bookings or timing, et cetera. So just help us if there's something more of that going on? Is 30% the new level now? Just any help there would be appreciated. 
William Lansing: Yes, absolutely. So as you know, we had many, many quarters of over 50% growth in the platform, and then we had slowed to the 40s, and now we're in the 30s. And I think that's a reasonable and sustainable level for the foreseeable future. I think we had always anticipated some level of slowing just because as that number gets bigger, that was inevitable. And I think that's really all it is.
 We're not seeing anything that's caused for any kind of concern or alarm. Our customers are buying the platform. They're expanding the use cases once they've got the platform in. There's a little bit of timing issues around various deals but I don't think anything really significant. I guess it's probably worth pointing out that the second half of the year is always bigger than the first half. And so there's more to come this year. 
Steven Weber: And Manav, I would just say we had a really difficult comp this quarter, too. Second quarter last year, the platform grew 60%. So we're growing more than 30% off of a pretty big number. It was a big step up last year in the second quarter. 
Manav Patnaik: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just one on the Scores, on the mortgage origination side or the moving pieces there, Steve. Maybe just how did volumes come in this quarter versus your expectations? And then when you think about the guidance raise, like what were the moving pieces there as well, please? 
Steven Weber: Yes. I mean you know how we guide. We're pretty conservative. We don't -- we're not banking on things getting better anytime soon. I mean I think even when we gave guidance last year, people at that point we're talking about 6 rate cuts in the year, and we weren't anticipating that.
 So the way we look at the guidance, and mortgage, obviously, being such a big piece of that, is that we don't expect things to get better in our fiscal year. And if they do, great, but it's hard for us to depend on that because obviously, the rates are going to be higher longer than anybody thought. So that's kind of how we look at that. So when they do come down, we'll enjoy that benefit, but we don't try to put a time line on that. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. 
Faiza Alwy: So I wanted to follow up on mortgage. You've taken obviously a lot of pricing successfully the last couple of years. And I know you have a long-term strategic plan of value creation here. And there's been some noise from regulators, other bodies. I'm curious how you think about that. And what are some of the factors that you're considering as you think about your long-term strategic plan on pricing? 
William Lansing: Well, as we've discussed in the past, we're catching up from 30 years of frozen pricing. And so our putting through price increases in this space is really a matter of trying to close the gap on the value that we provide relative to what we charge.
 The way we think about criticism, because you're right, every once in a while, there is noise about price increases. The way we think about it is transparency is our friend. And so we have increasingly been willing and interested to share exactly what our pricing is because it's such a small part of the overall bundle.
 So if the concern, whether it's from Congress or regulators or third-party groups, is about the level of expense associated with the FICO mortgage score, it's important for everyone to understand that we're talking about single-digit dollars in a bundle that cost a consumer about $6,000. So we point out the gigantic gap between what we charge and the bundle in which we reside. And we think that, that's the way to do it. We think transparency is our friend. 
Faiza Alwy: Great. And then just to follow up on other originations. Maybe you can talk about what you're seeing on the card and auto side in terms of volumes versus pricing. Sort of what's the overall environment like? And maybe if you've adjusted your expectations for volumes just given the macro environment here? 
William Lansing: I don't know that we've really adjusted our expectations. I think that what we're seeing is kind of in line with what we did expect, and it is a function of the macro environment. As we pointed out, we're down a little bit in auto and a little bit more in credit card and other. But I don't think it's any kind of surprise given the macro environment. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies. 
Surinder Thind: I'd like to revisit the Software business and more specifically, just kind of the bookings. When you think about the client conversations that you've been having, obviously, quite positive, but how much should we attribute to macro because there has been an overall slowdown? So is the earlier commentary that you -- the slowdown is not macro related to any extent? 
William Lansing: So I think that it's fair to put some of the explanation on macro environment because what we're not seeing is losses to competition. What we are seeing is projects deferred or taking a little bit longer. And so I think it's very fair to attribute some of that to the macro environment. 
Surinder Thind: Got it. And then I guess, turning to the nonplatform piece. When you think about volumes versus pricing, I think you mentioned CPI, but just any other color that you can provide? Is this mostly growth within like Falcon? Or how does pricing work here? Is it just CPI is the right number, and that's how it should continue? Or how should we think about that? 
William Lansing: So as you know, the nonplatform business is very mature and we're deeply embedded, and yet our customers often prefer to renew and renew and renew. And so there's a cycle of multiple renewals typically associated with our licensed software and with our legacy and nonplatform software.
 Our philosophy is to not push the limits on pricing there. The customers are the same customers who are buying platform from us and customers that we'll have a relationship with for the next 20 or 30 years. And so it's not about harvesting and gouging. We raise our prices to cover costs of adding features and functionality and cybersecurity and keeping the product current. But we're not really pushing the limits of what could be done on price there and don't really intend to. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Peterson with Needham. 
Kyle Peterson: I wanted to start on capital return. Obviously, it looks like you guys bought back a little bit more past quarter than the first quarter. How should we think about the pace of buybacks in the back half of the year? Obviously, you've seen a bit of a pullback in the shares, obviously, with market and such. And then also just given some of your comments on potential for free cash flow to accelerate as the year progresses. I just want to get your opinion on how you guys are thinking about that over the next few quarters. 
William Lansing: We remain as committed to buyback as we have ever been. And it is our intent to continue to spend at least our free cash flow and often in excess of our free cash flow on buyback every year. And I don't expect that would change. Our leverage has slipped a bit as our earnings have gone up. And I guess that's a happy bonus of being more profitable. And in the fullness of time, you'll see that reflected in increased buyback. 
Kyle Peterson: Got it. That makes sense, and that's helpful. And just a follow-up, I guess, on the professional services piece of the business, I guess that revenue is falling off a bit. I guess that it's lower margin. But I just want to get your sense as to kind of is this, call it, $19 million to $22 million a quarter, is that kind of a good range to use moving forward given the mix of the business that you guys are selling? Or was there anything kind of onetime in this past quarter that dragged it down a bit below kind of historical levels? 
William Lansing: I think it's a reasonable range to anticipate going forward. We love our professional services, and yet we're not a professional services company, first and foremost, we're a software company. And so our goal with professional services is to provide enough PS to manage quality installs and keep our customers happy.
 We're also delighted to have partners do the installation from us, and we're bringing out partners to do some of that work. I don't imagine that our PS will shrink much more than it already has. As you know, it's come down quite a bit. And we're probably pretty close to -- I think we're at kind of a base level that it would be hard to imagine going below. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC. 
Ashish Sabadra: I just had a quick question on the expense trajectory. I was wondering if you -- what should we expect there, both in terms of either sequential or year-on-year growth in expenses for the rest of the year? 
Steven Weber: Yes. So we had -- we said we had FICO World this quarter. So there's -- that's a pretty significant expense for us. So you'll see an increase in our Q3 spending by a little bit that's associated with that. And then the fourth quarter would probably be relatively flat to that or maybe even down a little bit. But we don't expect any significant uptick in expenses for the rest of the year. Really, it's basically due to the FICO World being held this quarter. 
Ashish Sabadra: That's helpful color. And maybe just from a modeling perspective, the on-prem software, again, the de-emphasis there, that's maybe one of the reasons why that piece of the Software revenue has been muted. How should we think about that going forward? Any color? 
William Lansing: About the on-prem software? 
Ashish Sabadra: Yes. 
Steven Weber: So I mean we're focused -- we're cloud-first, right? So we really are focused in the cloud. But if our customers want to run it on-prem, we'll sell it to them that way there. But I would expect that the on-prem piece is probably not going to grow a lot, but it's probably not going to shrink a lot either because a lot of those are deeply embedded, and it's going to take years to move it to the cloud. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. 
Jeffrey Meuler: So I want to go back to the card, p loan and other origination revenue down 9%. I think the majority of that is cards. So is pricing a positive contributor to that line? And if so, just based upon the bureaus that have reported thus far, it doesn't seem like card volumes are down that much, but I'd love [ to get your thoughts on ]... 
Steven Weber: It's a little apples and oranges. So this is just the originations piece. I mean our card in total is not down that much because we have a lot of the [ prescreen and ] account management. So the scores are not down that -- this is just the origination subset of that. There's very low pricing in it. So it's probably when you take all that into consideration, I think it's hard to compare our numbers actually across the board of what the bureau has put out.
 But things like card, every bureau has a different subset of banks -- subset of what we have. So there could be a lot of different things happening at different banks. So this is just on the originations piece. 
Jeffrey Meuler: Okay. And then at FICO World, you talked a bit about -- I forget the exact word, I think it's enterprise platform clients. But maybe talk through like how many of your platform clients have a single use case. And then of those, how many of them just signed on within the last year and kind of like what the typical path forward is for them broadening out their use case expansion and how long it typically takes? 
William Lansing: So depending on how you count it, we're in about 130 of the top 300 financial institutions globally. And of that, I'd say, 40% or so are on their first use case, maybe a little bit more than that. 
Jeffrey Meuler: And how many of those like just landed with you in the last year? And if you can just kind of like talk about the expansion path. 
William Lansing: I would say most of them have landed in the last year. I mean there's -- the very typical path for the single use case is to eventually move to multiple use cases. And so the ones that are still on one are typically the most recent. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. 
Keen Fai Tong: In Scores, you're catching up from 30 years of frozen pricing to close the gap with what you charge. You're closing the gap more quickly with mortgage than with cards and autos currently. To what extent can pricing in autos and cards close the gap at the same pace as the mortgages over time? What are some of the considerations? 
William Lansing: Well, as we've talked about in the past, we take the entire portfolio of Scores every year, and we evaluate it from top to bottom, thinking through what is the elasticity of demand for that particular kind of a score and where should the Scores prices move by CPI and not more than that and where should they move more than that. And so you're going to see variation in the portfolio always. I would never expect for us to raise prices the same amount across all scores. So yes, you could continue to expect them to be different. 
Keen Fai Tong: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then with respect to the Software business, you saw 32% platform ARR growth in the quarter from both land and expand. Can you break that down? How much of that growth is coming from new business wins versus wallet penetration from existing customers? 
Steven Weber: Yes, it's hard to do that, George. I mean you can kind of back into it a little bit by looking at the ARR versus the NRR, but we don't have the detail to talk about use cases versus usage. 
Keen Fai Tong: I guess maybe then qualitatively, would you say you're more in land mode or expand mode? 
Steven Weber: Well, I mean, it's -- I mean we're trying to get as much business as we can land in. But a lot of -- it's a lot easier to expand. Once it's in, they find their own use cases a lot of times. So a lot of our growth is coming from expansion because a lot of the initial use cases are really small. They're coming in at a very small amount, and they're expanding off of that. 
William Lansing: And you're on the right question. I think whether it's today or next quarter or the quarter after that, expand will exceed land sooner or later. That's inevitable, that's anticipated, that's coming. I don't think we're quite at the tipping point yet. I think land probably still exceeds expand, but I'm not sure. 
Operator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Dave Singleton for closing remarks. 
Dave Singleton: Did you want to check just one more time? Simon might be in the queue for a question, and he just popped in, in the last 5 seconds. 
Operator: We do have a question from Simon Clinch with Redburn Atlantic. 
Simon Alistair Clinch: I wanted to ask a couple of questions. So first of all, on the Software side, how should I think about the longer-term sustainable retention rates for both platform and nonplatform? 
Steven Weber: Yes. So the net retention rate on the nonplatform is probably going to dip below 100% at some point. These are legacy products that at some point are going to shift over to the platform. So that's been running probably just slightly above 100% and will probably be there for a while, but it could dip below 100% at some point.
 The net retention rate on the platform, it's been very strong as long as we've been reporting it. So it can vary, obviously, quarter-to-quarter, and there's no real trend to it. You've seen some quarters, it's been as low as in the hundred and teens and some quarters, it's been as high as 140-plus. But we do see continually that all the customers on the platform, almost without fail, use more the following year than they used the previous year. So there's still a lot of room to expand on that, and we think that's going to last for quite a while. 
Simon Alistair Clinch: Okay. Great. And just as a follow-up then. I mean you've managed to grow this business pretty rapidly with minimal sort of expense growth recently. I'm just thinking, when we're thinking out over the next decade, what are the kind of key investment areas you're looking at? And how do we extrapolate that to thinking about the durable expense growth in this business? 
William Lansing: The kind of the key expense, I would say growth. I would -- growth is probably the wrong word. I think we're happy with kind of the expense rates that we have. And if anything, they'll go down over time. But the places where we're spending that money from an R&D standpoint are on the product, on the ecosystem and the marketplace and that side of the house.
 And then I think we also have to think a lot about broadening our distribution because as you know, we have very limited direct distribution, and we have a reasonably nascent indirect partner distribution channel. So there will be more investment on both direct and indirect sales in coming years. 
Operator: Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'll now turn it back to Dave Singleton for closing. 
Dave Singleton: Thank you. Thanks, everyone, for the great questions, and we had another great quarter. That's about all I need to say. Thank you. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-01-25 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Fair Isaac Corporation quarterly earnings call. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, January 25, 2024. 
 It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to David Singleton. Please go ahead. 
Dave Singleton: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining FICO's first quarter earnings call. I'm Dave Singleton, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Steve Weber.
 Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. And on this call, management will also discuss results in comparison with the prior quarter to facilitate an understanding of the run rate of the business.
 Certain statements made in this presentation are forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. 
 Information concerning these risks and uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, particularly in the Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements portion of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team.
  This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G Schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G Schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. 
 And a replay of this webcast will be available through January 25, 2025.
 Now I will turn the call over to our CEO, Will Lansing. 
William Lansing: Thanks, Dave, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. In the Investor Relations section of our website, we posted some financial highlight slides that we'll be referencing during our talk today.
 I am so pleased to report that we had a great start to our fiscal year with double-digit growth in revenue, net income and EPS versus last year. It was a solid quarter, and we're well positioned for our fiscal 2024.
 As shown on Page 2 of the first quarter financial highlights, we reported first quarter revenues of $382 million, up 11% over last year; we delivered $121 million of GAAP net income in the quarter, up 24%; and GAAP earnings of $4.80 per share, up 25% from the prior year. 
 On a non-GAAP basis, quarter 1 net income was $121 million, with earnings of $4.81 per share, up 12% and 13%, respectively.
 We delivered free cash flow of $121 million in our first quarter, up 32% versus prior year. 
 We continue to return capital to our shareholders through buybacks. In quarter 1, we repurchased 78,000 shares at an average price of $915 per share. This month, we exhausted the remainder of the 2022 repurchase authorization, and we announced a new $500 million authorization this week.
 In our Scores segment, as you can see from Page 6, our first quarter revenues were $192 million, up 8% versus the prior year. On the B2B side, the current quarter revenues were up 12% versus the prior year. This is a strong result considering the impact of higher interest rates on loan origination volumes and also the Latin America license renewal that we had in Q1 of 2023.
 On the B2C side, the current quarter revenues were down 3% versus the prior year. First quarter mortgage originations revenues were up 188% versus the prior year. Auto originations were down 3%. Credit card, personal loan and other originations revenues were down 5% versus the prior year.
 We continue to see traction with our latest score, FICO Score 10 T. As you'll recall, last quarter, we announced that Movement Mortgage was an early adopter of FICO 10 T. This quarter, we announced that CrossCountry Mortgage, which is the nation's #3 retail mortgage lender, will use FICO 10 T to analyze its nonconforming loans. They are the first lender of originating loans to be issued in a mortgage-backed security based exclusively on the FICO Score 10 T. These clients, in addition to others, have signed up to demonstrate to investors and to rating agencies and to other stakeholders a real-world example of the improved predictive performance offered by FICO Score 10 T.
 In our Software segment, we delivered $190 million in quarter 1 revenue, up 14% from last year. We continue to drive strong growth in ARR and NRR through our land-and-expand strategy, with expand driven by increased customer usage. As you can see on Page 7, total ARR was up 18% with platform ARR growth -- growing 43% and nonplatform ARR growing 11%. 
 Total NRR for the quarter, shown on Page 8, was 114%, with platform NRR at 136% and nonplatform NRR at 108%.
 We do continue to see strong demand from our new customers. Our total ACV bookings for the quarter were $18 million, a good result after a particularly strong fourth quarter. We continue to have a robust pipeline of opportunities, particularly with FICO Platform offerings. 
 We've expanded our FICO Platform reach both by geography and by customer type. In December, we launched FICO Platform with an event in India, and we've already had several early adopters looking to expand to multiple use cases. In the U.K., StepChange Debt Charity, a market leader, will use the FICO Platform to provide individual outcomes to consumers seeking to become debt-free. 
 Our biggest opportunity near term continues to be in North America, where banks are focused on digital transformation and understand the value of the FICO Platform, where data-driven analytics allow hyper-personalized decisioning and consumer interactions on a real-time basis. 
 We continue to innovate and bring new capabilities to the FICO Platform and work with new customers to demonstrate value and with existing customers to expand use cases. Our innovation will be highlighted at this year's FICO World event, which will take place in San Diego in April. I'll have more on that later. But for now, let me turn the call over to Steve for further financial details. 
Steven Weber: Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. As Will mentioned, we had another very good quarter with total revenue of $382 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year, or 12% when adjusted for last year's divestiture. 
 Scores segment revenues for the quarter were $192 million, up 8% from Q1 of 2023. B2B revenues were up 12% driven by mortgage originations revenues. Our growth would have been higher if not for the Latin American license revenue, which we'll talk about, in Q1 of 2023 that did not recur this year.
 Our B2C revenues were down 3% versus the prior year due to declines in our myFICO business, partially offset by our licensed B2C business. 
 Scores (sic) [ Software ] segment revenues in the first quarter were $190 million, up 14% versus Q1 of 2023 or 17% when adjusted for the divestiture. This quarter, 83% of total company revenues were derived from our Americas region, which is a combination of our North America and Latin America regions. Our EMEA region generated 10% of revenues, and the Asia Pacific region delivered 7%. Our total Software ARR was $688 million, an 18% increase over the prior year. 
 Platform ARR was $190 million, representing 28% of our total Q1 '24 ARR, up from 23% of total Q1 '23 ARR. Platform ARR grew 43% versus the prior year, while nonplatform ARR grew 11% to $497 million this quarter. 
 Our Platform land-and-expand strategy continues to be very successful. Our dollar-based net retention rate in the quarter was 114% versus 110% last year. Platform NRR was 136% versus 130% in the prior year, while our nonplatform NRR was 108% versus 103% in the prior year. Nonplatform ARR growth was driven by customers' increased usage and CPI price increases.
 Our Software ACV bookings for the quarter were $18.3 million versus $21.5 million in the prior year. We view this as a successful sales quarter coming off a record quarter in our fourth quarter of '23. Remember that ACV bookings include only the annual value of software sales and exclude professional services.
 Turning now to our expenses for the quarter. Total operating expenses were $231 million this quarter versus $205 million in the prior year. Our current quarter expenses are a 3% increase from the prior quarter, which was $224 million. As we indicated last quarter, we maintain our focus on investment to accelerate development and distribution of the FICO Platform. And as a reminder, our incremental investment is relatively modest and is already built into our guidance.
 Our non-GAAP operating margin, as shown in our Reg G Schedule, was 48% for the quarter.
 GAAP net income this quarter was $121 million, up 24% from the prior year's quarter. Adjusting for excess tax benefit and the prior year Siron divestiture, our one -- year-over-year GAAP net income grew 14%. Our non-GAAP net income was $121 million for the quarter, up 12% from the prior year's quarter.
 The effective tax rate for the quarter was 7% and included $24 million of reduced tax expense from excess tax benefits recognized upon the settlement or exercise of employee stock awards. In the prior year, the excess tax benefit was $10 million. We believe that our fiscal year 2024 net effective tax rate will be around 22%, while our recurring tax rate is expected to be around 26%. Again, the recurring tax rate is before any excess tax benefit and other discrete items.
 Free cash flow for the quarter was $121 million, a 32% increase on the previous year. The trailing 12-month free cash flow was $494 million compared to $465 million in the prior year. 
 At the end of the quarter, we had $197 million in cash and marketable investments. Our total debt at quarter end was $1.96 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2%. Currently, 66% of our total debt is fixed rate. Our floating debt is prepayable at any time and gives us the flexibility to use free cash flow to reduce outstanding floating debt balances in future periods.
 Turning to return of capital. We bought back 78,000 shares in the first quarter at an average price of $915 per share. At the end of the quarter, we had $49 million remaining on the Board authorization, and as Will mentioned, we subsequently bought additional shares in January, exhausting the authorization. And this week, we announced a new $500 million repurchase authorization. And we continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash.
 And with that, I'll turn it back to Will for his final thoughts. 
William Lansing: Thanks, Steve. I am excited about our traction as we continue to drive more innovation than ever. In the Scores business, our financial inclusion efforts continue as we launched a FICO Score aimed at helping Ukrainian refugees displaced through the war have access to credit.
 Additionally, we added our third historically Black college and university, Delaware State University, as part of our FICO Educational Analytics Challenge. This is a program created to help promote diversity in data science, engineering and technology.
 In the Software business, we added 20 new enhancements to the FICO Platform and expanded our patent footprint to over 220 patents by adding 10 patents related to digital decisioning, fraud detection, machine learning and responsible AI. And this innovation will be on display at FICO World 2024, where we will showcase how FICO truly supercharges our clients' digital transformations. At this 4-day event, which takes place in April, we'll bring together industry professionals from around the world to connect, share best practices and learn how FICO enables organizations to power customer connections at scale. We will highlight successful clients and demonstrate the power of the FICO Platform, enabling companies to operationalize analytics, become more composable and make better decisions at scale.
 With that, I'll turn the call back to Dave, and we'll open up the Q&A session. 
Dave Singleton: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we're now ready to take questions. Operator, please open the lines. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. 
Faiza Alwy: So I first wanted to ask about Software. You touched on this a little bit, but give us a bit more color on the Software pipeline. As you said, you do have FICO World coming up. So what are some of the new things that we should watch for? 
 And as part of that, if you can address some seasonality in the business because we had a bit of a step-down in ARR, so talk a bit about what your expectations are for ARR as we move through the year. Is the step-down more seasonal? Or should we expect sort of more of a structural slowdown? 
William Lansing: Yes. I think it's not so much -- well, just to take this in reverse order, not really a seasonal thing so much as it is deals move around, and they move from quarter-to-quarter. And I would say, this quarter, some deals were pushed to next quarter. We don't see that as a very big deal, I mean, not something that we're focused on.
 The pipeline is the strongest it has ever been, and it's also the most mature it's ever been. So I would say, in terms of the stages of the pipeline, we're seeing more maturity within the pipeline than we have in years past. So we're actually feeling really good about the pipeline.
 In terms of what to expect at FICO World, I think that you'll have what we traditionally do, which is take you through the latest and greatest in innovation from FICO. We're also going to see a lot of customers who are delighted to stand up in front of their peers and explain all the value that they're getting out of the FICO Platform. So I think you'll see just a lot of reference customers.
 And part of FICO World, it's not just a sales event for us. It's really an event for our customers to help sell to one another because they wind up being our best references. And so it's a place where best practices get passed around, and there's a lot of adoption of FICO technology there. 
Faiza Alwy: Great. And then just switching on the Scores side. I wonder if anything has changed as it relates to your volume expectations for 2024. There has been -- since we -- since you last reported earnings and gave the guide, it seems like the overall environment might be trending a little bit better. There's at least some more optimism. So I'm curious if anything was different as it relates to your expectations in the quarter itself and how you're thinking about volumes going forward. 
William Lansing: So we're very comfortable with our guidance, and we continue to see volumes roughly where we expected, frankly. I'm not sure I agree with the view that there's more optimism. I mean rates have ticked up in mortgages recently, and so, if anything, I guess, I feel like the rate -- the fall in rates might be slower than a lot of industry pundits had been forecasting.
 That said, as you know, FICO is always very conservative in our view about these things. And so I wouldn't say that we're caught in any way by a little uptick in rates or by slowness in rates coming down. There's no question that we will benefit tremendously as volumes increase when rates come down. And we anticipate that within the year and within next year. But I'd say, right now, no change in our outlook. 
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies. 
Surinder Thind: So Will, just another follow-up question on the Software business. Can you talk a little bit about, I guess, the pipeline when it comes to kind of new clients? When I do the math, it looks like the pace at which new clients are bringing on ARR has been slowing for a number of quarters now. Just any color on your ability to bring on board new clients at this point? 
William Lansing: We have not had any challenges bringing on new clients. I mean as our penetration goes up, we will have captured more and more of our target enterprise customer base, and more and more of the growth will be from the expand part of the business, which is more use cases and more volume with existing customers.
 It does take some time to onboard, so it doesn't always show up instantly. But I would -- I think what you're going to see over time is a mix shift from land to expand, although we're not having any trouble landing; we continue to land new customers. 
Steven Weber: Yes. I would just say, Surinder, that when we start with someone that's really new, the lead time is longer on them than an existing customer. So that's why you'll see some of that. But we still signed a lot of new deals with a lot of new customers or at least different use cases with customers that are using some of our legacy products. 
Surinder Thind: Got it. And then in terms of just the color around the margins in the Software business at this point. When I kind of go through the numbers, sounds like you've built in all of the -- what you kind of need for this year in terms of your guide. So does that mean that incremental revenue, should they show up, generally will drop to the bottom line? Or how should we think about things like that? 
William Lansing: Yes. That's a great question. I think, in general, that's a fair statement. We're pretty comfortable with where the margins are, and our expenses are running in line with what we expect and what we forecast and what we planned for. And so what you said is largely right. Incremental revenue should fall through to the bottom line.
 That said, as incremental revenue comes in, we do reevaluate whether we want to devote some portion of that to additional resource for more rapid development. So will 100% of it fall to the bottom line? I don't know. We'll see. 
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. 
Manav Patnaik: Steve, maybe just to follow up on that, if you could help with the Software kind of cadence around the operating expense. Looks like it ticked up sequentially, maybe a little bit higher than we thought. But since everything is running in line, can you just walk us through how we should think about the expense spend there? 
Steven Weber: Yes. So I mean we talked about that a little bit last quarter that we're making some investments. There's a lot of growth here, and we think there's a lot more room for growth. And we're doing some investment on the R&D side to add more functionality. And we're doing some investment on cybersecurity as well. So there is some investment coming in there. There's a lot of different moving parts this quarter because you've got -- we had the end of the year bonuses that happened too, so that rolls in here as well.
 So you'll probably continue to see the expenses trend up through the year as we bring more people on. We have about 100 more people today than we had a year ago, right? So we're investing, like we said, in those specific areas. So -- but you'll see the expenses throughout the year trend up but not really all that dramatically. 
Manav Patnaik: Okay. Fair enough. And then, Will, just in terms of the lending commentary, I mean, I think we all have our views on mortgage, so let's put that aside for a second. But can you just walk us through what's going on in auto and card with both those down 3% and 5%? Just anything to call out there and what the outlook for '24 is really for those 2 categories? 
William Lansing: I don't have a lot of additional to add there. I mean it's down a little bit and again, not a gigantic surprise to us. I think we're very kind of comfortable with that. It's within our kind of range of forecast, so not -- we wouldn't consider it a big surprise. And in terms of guessing about the future, honestly, Manav, your guess is as good as ours. We're -- as you know, we're a trailing indicator. 
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Kyle Peterson with Needham. 
Kyle Peterson: Wanted to continue on the expenses and kind of what you guys saw this quarter. I guess, in terms of mix of revenue, it looks like there's a lower amount of professional services, which usually would think of as kind of a bit of a drag on expenses. So I just want to see how we should think about the relationship between services revenue in some of these buckets versus the expense growth. Like is there any lag? Or how should we think about some of the puts and takes there? 
Steven Weber: No. I mean so the professional services piece is a little bit unique because most of the PS work is done by internal resources. So in some cases, if they're not working on billable deals, they're working on R&D. In some cases, we've moved people into that function as well. So those costs don't necessarily go away.
 The professional services piece for us really is most of it's implementation work that we do on the Software side. So we don't really look at that necessarily as a profit center. But in terms of as an indicator of potential expenses, I think the PS tends to run in that $20 million to $25 million range. It was a little bit lower this quarter, but it's never going to be a lot higher because we're really -- we're kind of downplaying that aspect. And we don't have as many resources in PS as we've had in past years. So I don't think you're ever going to see that really tick up or really have much of a material impact on the overall margin of the business. 
Kyle Peterson: Maybe just to follow up on the guidance methodology, particularly on the Scores side. Things looks like -- it sounds like your overall revenue top line is pretty much unchanged, and the volume assumptions seem the same. So I guess could you just confirm on the pricing assumptions and kind of maybe what actions you guys have taken on that front? And if everything that went into effect on the 1st of the year is in the guidance or if there's still kind of a wait-and-see approach with volumes? 
Steven Weber: Well, I mean, there's still a lot of -- obviously a lot of volatility around the volume. So I think next quarter, yes, all the pricing went into effect in first part of January. We'll have a lot more color that we can provide next quarter because we'll see the impacts of all that. We'll see how -- we'll be that much farther into the year, and we'll know a lot more about what volumes look like. And frankly, we'll know a lot more about what the rate environment looks like probably in 3 months. So we'll be able to provide more color for the rest of the year at that point. 
Operator: And our next question is from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. 
Keen Fai Tong: You've announced removing tiered pricing increases for mortgage scores this year. Can you talk a little bit about your pricing strategy for autos and credit cards and how pricing trends in these categories will likely compare with last year? 
William Lansing: So we have adjusted price -- you identified, you highlighted probably the biggest change in pricing this year, which was collapsing the tiers in mortgage. And that was really in response to a lot of feedback from the industry about a level playing field, and so we accommodated that.
 In terms of the others, we -- as you know, we adjust prices in every segment every year, and it's relatively surgical. We go pocket by pocket and think through what we can do. Virtually, all of our scores have some level of CPI inflation pricing adjustment. And then others get some additional beyond that where we consider it appropriate. I'd say that we did not take very significant actions in auto and card, not worth calling out separately and beyond kind of cost-of-living adjustment this year. 
Keen Fai Tong: Got it. That's helpful. And can you provide a little bit of detail around some of the real-time trends that you're seeing with mortgage inquiries and some of the real-time trends that you're seeing with card volumes and auto volumes? 
William Lansing: With mortgage, I'd say the surprise is that we're seeing a little bit of refi activity. It doesn't take very much for people to come back in the market and try to refinance their mortgages. And so even a point of decline is enough to generate some volume that we didn't really anticipate.
 Steve, maybe you want to comment on the other. 
Steven Weber: Yes. I mean in terms of real time, frankly, most of the reporting we get is in arrears to some degree, so the numbers you can get from industry analysts are going to be much more real time than what we can provide. There's a lot of industry data that's provided on a weekly basis. That's going to be much more real time than what we'll be able to give you. 
Keen Fai Tong: And are any -- what about some of the arrears numbers that you're seeing with cards and autos? 
Steven Weber: Well, I think like card was running a lot hotter last year, right? I mean coming out of -- when the refi slowed down, although there was a big pickup in card, and we're still seeing that kind of slowdown then about a year ago now. So it's pretty steady. I think there's been a lot of pullback on the subprime markets. But overall, it's not all that materially different. The volumes are not. They'll fluctuate a little bit depending on even what some of the bigger players might do in any one given quarter. But again, that's not -- that's probably not as across the board as mortgage, which is more driven by consumer demand that's tied to interest rates. 
Keen Fai Tong: Great. And commentary on autos? 
Steven Weber: Autos, I mean, autos is relatively stable and has been through that. I mean it's a few percent here or there, but you don't see a lot of volatility in the auto market, at least on the lending side. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question is from the line of Seth Weber with Wells Fargo Securities. 
Seth Weber: I wanted to ask, just to go back to the comment about some deals getting pushed to the second quarter, is there anything idiosyncratic that you'd call out there? Or is there any focus on any certain product -- customer categories or regions or anything that you'd attribute that to? Or are you just seeing an elongation of the sales cycle? Because I think, in prior quarters, you guys had talked about a shortening of the sales cycle. So I'm just trying to understand if there's any kind of bigger change that's going on here. 
William Lansing: No, not really. I mean the sales cycle is roughly where it's been lately, which is shorter than where it was a year or 2 years ago. I would say that -- and really I mean just there's nothing special there. The -- we -- it's probably worth reiterating that FICO, unlike a lot of other software companies, doesn't do a lot of wheeling and dealing at the end of the quarter to pull in business, and it is cultural with us.
 Our salespeople and all of our employees really live, act, believe in our #1 corporate value, which is act like an owner. We are really truly aligned with shareholders. We think about it as a family business. And that includes the salespeople at end of quarter. And that's not to say that we don't make a push at the end of the quarter to close business. Obviously, we do like everyone.
 But what's not on the table is a bunch of extra discounting and Hail Mary-type stuff just to pull something in a week earlier. I mean we just don't care. And you'll never find FICO making radical concessions at quarter end to prop up a quarterly number. It's just not who we are.
 And so it's just worth keeping that in mind. So when we say deals move from quarter-to-quarter, it has more to do with the client and their budget time line and their approval process than it has to do with anything else. 
Steven Weber: Yes. And I would just say, practically, we had some deals that we didn't sign that last week of December just because it was hard to get people, right? I mean you run into this issue every December that you might have people that are out on vacation or traveling. You just can't get the ink on the paper. So some of these deals have actually closed in January.
 So I don't -- again, from Will's point -- it's a great point. We're not scrambling trying to do everything humanly possible to get the deal signed in the last week of December as opposed to the first week of January. 
Seth Weber: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then just can you -- just expanding on that a little bit, can you just update us on any traction that you're seeing, whatever traction you're seeing kind of outside the financial services area for the Platform business and whether you're seeing bigger uptake there from nontraditional customers? 
William Lansing: Yes. I would say that our Platform business is still very much focused on financial services. The business we do outside financial services today, we do closely aligned stuff like insurance. We do that. But in terms of really nonfinancial services verticals, I would say the lion's share of that is in the optimization area, where we have the world's leading optimization engine. And so it's used by airlines and retailers and all kinds of -- sports scheduling and all kinds of places that are not as typical when you think of FICO.
 That said, our strategy around nonfinancial services is very much to go there through partners. We have a really robust and growing and ever-stronger indirect sales force where our partners focus on both geography, and geographies where we're not so present and on -- partners and geographies where we're not present and then on verticals where we're not as represented.
 And I think you'll see, as our strategy evolves -- and you've heard us talk about building an open ecosystem for -- with the decisioning platform available to any B2C company interested in using it. That's happening this year. I mean we will have open APIs this year. We will have software development kits for ISVs and retailers and VARs and those who want to take our decisioning solutions to other verticals. So you'll see that starting to happen this year. But that's really our strategy, is to do that through partners. There's not much of that that we do directly. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. 
Ashish Sabadra: Just a quick question on the mortgage volume. Did you provide what the mortgage volume growth was in the first quarter of '24? 
Steven Weber: No, we just talked about the revenues. We don't pull out the different components in terms of the volumes. But I mean you can get the volumes from other third-party sources pretty easily. 
Ashish Sabadra: No, that's helpful. And then maybe on the headwind from the Lat Am license revenue, can you just remind us how much was that revenue in the prior year, 1Q '23? Or how should we think about the growth in the business excluding that onetime headwind? And then as we go through the rest of the year, just curious if there's any other license renewal headwind to be cognizant of. 
Steven Weber: There's potentially license -- I mean the renewals are hard to project, frankly, because we don't know when they're going to renew or sometimes, they'll renew early. Sometimes they will renew later if they'll -- taking on additional pieces. So the renewal piece is [ still gummy ].
 If you look at the next couple of quarters, we had some pretty big point-in-time revenue last year in Q2 and Q3. So we may not have that again this year. Sometimes we have renewals that end up moving to the platform, and they end up becoming ratable revenues. So they don't have up-front license revenue.
 So we're actively trying to move people, obviously, to the platform, which we forego the up-front license revenue in favor of recurring revenue. So as those happen, you're going to see changes there. That's typical to companies that are moving to ratable revenue, but it's been less dramatic for us as we've done over time. But there's always the potential that you're going to see that, and you'll have to think about that as different quarters come up. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. 
Jeffrey Meuler: I didn't understand the answer on the last question. The Lat Am renewal in the year ago, that was in Scores, not Software, correct? 
Steven Weber: Yes, that was in Scores. I'm sorry. That was in Scores. And the ones in Scores happen occasionally. We'll have license deals. Typically, they're foreign deals in areas where a large bank wants to build their own score model, and we'll sign deals with them. So that -- within Scores, we occasionally have those, and it's difficult to -- again, even with those, it's difficult to know what the timing is going to be. 
Jeffrey Meuler: Okay. And then just trying to -- I guess, probably the last question as well, like the 21% growth in B2B Scores last quarter, 12% growth this quarter. How much of that slowdown is just due to the Lat Am comp in the year ago? Or anything else that you can say on like non-origination revenue trends? Because it doesn't look like a lot of [ slowing really ]. 
Steven Weber: Yes, it's primarily -- it's completely due to Lat Am and lower mortgage volumes in Q1 versus Q4, right? I mean that's -- we're volume takers, obviously, right? I mean if the volumes are down, which they're going to be -- they're going to be anyway seasonally in that quarter. The December quarter has fewer mortgages typically than the September quarter does. So it's the combination of those 2 things. Outside of originations, it was up slightly. The non-origination business was up slightly but not all that significant. 
Jeffrey Meuler: Okay. And then can you just help me with like any rough order of magnitude of sizing? If I look at mortgage -- your mortgage origination revenue, roughly how much of it comes from closed loans versus things like rate shopping or applications that don't result in a closed loan or anything else that would like fall in that bucket? 
Steven Weber: Yes. Frankly, we don't know because we don't -- I mean, actually, I think if you asked the bureaus, they'll tell you the same thing. The bundles get pulled for -- with scores and data, and they don't necessarily know -- nobody necessarily knows. If ever, the actual lender knows if it was closed or not. So we don't really know whether they turned into a closed loan or not. That's not reported to us. 
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Rajiv Bhatia with Morningstar. 
Rajiv Bhatia: Sorry if I missed it, but can you provide what percentage of your Scores revenue was mortgage in the quarter? Like I know you'd provided that in the previous quarters. 
Steven Weber: Yes. We didn't provide that. I don't have the number in front of me, what the percentage was. So I -- we don't -- we didn't -- occasionally, we will do that. We didn't provide that this quarter. So you could probably back into it if you took the numbers we gave you from last year and then the percentage increases. 
Rajiv Bhatia: Okay. We can follow up I guess. And then I know we talked about like the Latin America kind of Scores license. But if I look at like the Asia Score revenue in your 10-K -- or 10-Q, it was, I think, $5.9 million and definitely more than $4.1 million for the -- for all of fiscal 2023. So I guess is that like [indiscernible]? 
Steven Weber: Yes, we had our license deal in Asia in Scores. So we had a much larger one in Latin America last year. And then we -- if you look at it in any given quarter, probably half the time, we have a license deal somewhere. But obviously, the total license deals this year were much smaller this year than they were last year. And that was because of the Latin American deal. 
Operator: And at this time, there are no more questions in the queue. I will now conclude the call. So thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. This does conclude the conference call, and we thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

===== 2023 Q4  (2023-11-08 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Fair Isaac Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, November 8, 2023.  I'd now like to turn the conference over to Dave Singleton, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Dave Singleton : Good afternoon and thank you for joining FICO's fourth quarter earnings call. I'm Dave Singleton, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Steve Weber.  Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison with the prior quarter to facilitate an understanding of the run rate of our business.  Certain statements made in this presentation are forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these risks and uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, particularly in the Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements portion of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team.  This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and the Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation Schedule G are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through November 8, 2024.  Now I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Will Lansing. 
William Lansing : Thanks, Dave. Thank you, everyone, for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. In the Investor Relations section of our website, we've posted some slides that we'll be referencing during our presentation today.  I am pleased to report we had a strong quarter, which completed another outstanding year with record annual revenues and record earnings, meeting the guidance that we raised last quarter.  Page 2 shows financial highlights from our fourth quarter. We reported fourth quarter revenues of $390 million, up 12% over the prior year; and $1.514 billion of revenue for the fiscal year, up 10% versus the prior year. We delivered $101 million of GAAP net income in the quarter and GAAP earnings of $4.01.  For the full fiscal year, we delivered $429 million in GAAP net income, which equates to $16.93 of earnings per share. On a non-GAAP basis, Q4 net income was $127 million with earnings of $5.01 per share.  Full year non-GAAP net income was $500 million, up 10% over last year with $19.71 of non-GAAP earnings per share, which is up 14% versus the prior year. We continue to deliver strong free cash flow with a record $163 million in our fourth quarter. For the full year, we delivered $465 million of free cash flow. We continue to return capital to our shareholders through buybacks. In fiscal 2023, we repurchased 615,000 shares at an average price of $659 per share.  In our scores segment, as you can see from Page 6, our fourth quarter revenues were $196 million, up 12% versus the prior year. For the full year, our revenues were $774 million, up 10% versus last year. On the B2B side, the current quarter revenues were up 21% versus the prior year and up 18% for the full year. This is a strong result, considering the impact of rising interest rates on loan origination volumes.  On the B2C side, the current quarter revenues were down 6% versus the prior year and down 8% for the full year due to difficult comps. Fourth quarter mortgage origination revenues were up 147% versus the prior year and accounted for 24% of our scores revenues and 12% of our total company revenues. Auto origination revenues were up 2%, while credit card and personal loan origination revenues were down 2% versus the prior year.  We continue to innovate in scores. We're happy to see traction with our latest score, FICO Score 10 T. This quarter, we announced that Movement Mortgage, a top 10 retail mortgage lender, has become an early adopter of FICO Score 10 T. They're using it to analyze their nonconforming loans in conjunction with the classic FICO Scores. As a first-in-market user of FICO Score 10 T, Movement Mortgage will work with FICO to share early-use insights for nonconforming products to help the mortgage industry understand the benefits of the most predictive credit score in the space. Movement Mortgage's use of FICO Score 10 T will provide opportunities to evaluate risk more efficiently in credit positioning.  The improvements in the predictive power of FICO Score 10 T can help lenders avoid unexpected credit risk and better control default rates while making more competitive credit offers to more consumers. And this all occurs without sacrificing the trusted FICO Score minimum scoring criteria and user experience. A more predictive score will help project cash flows with more precision, potentially increasing the value of securitized assets on the secondary market.  In our software segment, we delivered $194 million in Q4 revenue, up 11% from last year. We delivered $740 million in fiscal year revenue, up 10% from last year. We continue to drive strong growth in ARR and NRR through our land-and-expand strategy with expand driven by increased customer usage.  As shown on Page 7, total ARR was up 22% with platform ARR growing 53% and non-platform ARR growing 14%. Total NRR for the quarter shown on Page 8, was 120% with platform NRR at 145% and non-platform NRR at 111%. We continue to see strong demand from new customers. Our total ACV bookings for the year were $94 million, up 10% year-over-year.  There continues to be strong demand for our FICO Platform. We've built a strong pipeline of prospects interested in using this advanced decisioning technology to optimize interactions with our consumer customers. And we continue to be recognized for our technology. Chartis ranked FICO #1 for innovation and risk management technology for the seventh consecutive year, and we're in the top 5 as a risk and compliance technology provider for the second year in a row. Forrester identified FICO as a leader in AI decisioning platform, and Juniper Resources awarded FICO Platform the Future Digital Award for Banking Innovation of the Year.  I'll highlight the fiscal year 2024 guidance in just a few minutes. But first, let me turn the call back to Steve -- over to Steve for further financial details. 
Steven Weber : Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. We had another outstanding fiscal year, and we are excited about our momentum as we head into fiscal 2024. As Will mentioned, total revenue for the quarter was $390 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year. Full year revenue of $1.514 billion was up 10% over last year.  Scores revenues for the quarter were $196 million, up 12% from Q4 of 2022. B2B revenues were up 21% driven by mortgage originations as other areas within B2B were relatively flat to the prior year. Our B2C revenues were down 6% versus the prior year due to primarily to our myFICO.com business, where our B2C partner business was relatively flat compared to the prior year.  For the full year, scores revenues were $774 million, up 10% from the prior year, despite sizable headwinds in the mortgage originations market. Software segment revenues in the fourth quarter were $194 million, up 11% versus Q4 of 2022, with full year software revenues of $740 million, up 10% from the previous year.  This quarter, 85% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region, which is a combination of our North America and Latin American regions. Our EMEA region generated 9% and the Asia Pacific region delivered 6%.  Our total software ARR was $669 million, a 22% increase over the prior year. Platform ARR was $173 million, representing 26% of our Q4 ARR, up from 21% in Q4 of 2022. Platform ARR grew 53% versus the prior year, while non-platform ARR grew 14% and ended the year at $496 million.  Our customers continue to show very strong net expansion from land-and-expand follow-on sales and increased usage. Our dollar-based net retention rate in the quarter was 120% for the total software business. Platform NRR was 145% versus 129% in the prior year, while our non-platform NRR was 111% versus 101% in the prior year. Non-platform was driven by customers' increased usage and some CPI increases.  Our software ACV bookings for the quarter were $28 million versus $29 million in the prior year. And as a reminder, Q4 of 2022 contained one very large deal. ACV bookings increased 10% for the full year to $94 million versus $85 million in the prior year. And as a reminder, ACV bookings include only the annual value of software sales and exclude professional services.  Turning now to our expenses for the quarter. Total operating expenses were $224 million this quarter versus $215 million in the prior year, an increase of 4%. For the full year, our expenses were $871 million versus $835 million in the prior year, also an increase of 4%.  In fiscal 2024, we maintain our focus on efficiencies and are committed to prioritizing resources to our most strategic initiatives. In the next year, we'll be focused on investment to accelerate development and distribution of FICO Platform. We also plan to invest in cybersecurities to continue to remain a top standard for both the protection of our clients and the FICO assets. The incremental investment is relatively modest and built into our guidance.  Our non-GAAP operating margin, as shown in our Reg G schedule, was 51% both for the quarter and the full year. We delivered non-GAAP margin expansion of 300 basis points for the full fiscal year.  GAAP net income this quarter was $101 million, up 12% from the prior year quarter. Our non-GAAP net income was $227 million for the full -- for the quarter, up 30% from the prior year quarter. For the full year, GAAP net income was $429 million, up 15% from last year. And non-GAAP net income for the current year was $500 million, up 10% from last year.  The effective tax rate for the full year was 22%, including $13 million of reduced tax expense from excess tax benefits recognized upon the settlement or exercise of employee stock awards, and $9 million reduction associated with the valuation of our R&D tax credits. We expect our fiscal 2024 effective tax rate to remain around 22%, while our recurring tax rate is expected to be around 26%. Again, the recurring tax rate is before any excess tax benefits and other discrete items.  Free cash flow for the quarter was a record breaking $163 million. For the full year, the free cash flow was $465 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $170 million in cash and marketable investments. Our total debt at quarter end was $1.86 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 5.1%. Currently, about 70% of our total debt is fixed rate. Our floating rate debt is prepayable at any time, giving us the flexibility to use free cash flow to reduce outstanding floating rate debt balances in future periods.  As Will said, we bought back 136,000 shares in the fourth quarter at an average price of $859 per share. In fiscal 2023, we repurchased 615,000 shares at an average price of $659 per share for a total of $406 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $121 million remaining on the current Board authorization, and we continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash.  And with that, I'll turn it back to Will for his thoughts on fiscal 2024. 
William Lansing : Thanks, Steve. As we enter fiscal 2024, I remain excited about our future. Both our software and scores businesses are best in class, and our continued investment will accelerate our competitive advantage. We continually look for ways to build our brand and expand our outreach.  Last quarter, I talked about our financial literacy efforts. Today, I'd like to discuss the launch of the FICO Educational Analytics Challenge. This program, which we've created for students at historically black colleges and universities, features remote mentoring from FICO data scientists and in-person lectures by FICO's Chief Analytics Officer, Dr. Scott Zoldi. The FICO Educational Analytics Challenge is a program created to help promote diversity in data science, engineering and technology.  Today, we announced the departure of Stephanie Covert, who has led our software business. Stephanie was instrumental in driving FICO software growth and platform transformation, and we wish her well in her future endeavors.  Before we open for questions, I'll review our fiscal '24 guidance. While we don't break out our segments, we do expect growth in both our scores and software segments. As with prior years, we expect the pricing initiatives in fiscal '24 to have an additional impact beyond our guided numbers. And because of uncertainty in volumes, it's difficult to estimate the timing and magnitude of that impact.  Our fiscal 2023 bookings, strong pipeline, recurring revenues and diversified product portfolio give us considerable visibility into fiscal 2024. So today, we're guiding double-digit growth for both revenue and earnings, as shown on Page 13 of the presentation. We're guiding revenues of about $1.675 billion, an 11% increase versus last year. We are guiding GAAP net income of approximately $490 million, an increase of 14%; GAAP EPS of approximately $19.45, an increase of 15%; non-GAAP net income of about $566 million, an increase of 13%; and non-GAAP earnings per share of about $22.45, an increase of 14%.  With that, I'll turn the call back to Dave, and we'll take some questions. 
Dave Singleton : Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we're now ready to take questions. Operator, please open the lines. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. 
Faiza Alwy : So I wanted a little bit more color on 2024 revenues and EPS. One, you mentioned that origination volumes have been slower. It looks like there's been some tightening, but it seems you're confident in the growth around the scores business. It seems that you are taking some pricing on the -- sort of incremental pricing on the mortgage side. So give us some more color around how you're thinking about all those variables around volume and pricing across the various verticals. 
William Lansing : So what our forecast reflects is lower volumes than last year, so a decline versus last year, and roughly flat volumes from the level we're at today. That's how we think about the volume side. And as you know, we take price action for CPI, and sometimes in excess of CPI, every year. And so this year is no different. We will be doing that again. 
Faiza Alwy : Okay. Understood. And then I'm curious on the expense side. Steve, I think you made some mention around moderate increase in expenses. Give us an idea of how we should think about expense growth in 2024. 
Steven Weber : Yes. I mean it is pretty modest. I mean you can -- when you build out your model, you'll see there's some additional expense in there but not a lot. But a lot of it's reprioritization, right? We're looking to invest on the software side. We're putting a lot of money into the platform as we've done, and we're putting money into security to make sure that we're secure as possible. So it's relatively modest. But we definitely are adding some additional investment there from what we've seen in the past few years. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. 
George Tong : You typically set your rate card in your scores business in the beginning of September. After your scores prices were set, did you notice a negative inflection in credit volumes in September and October, particularly among sub-prime consumers? And if you did, do you believe your scores pricing increases next year are as high as they need to be to sustain your growth momentum? 
Steven Weber : Yes. I mean that's a good question, George. The volatility on the card side can be pretty dramatic and it could be pretty short-lived. So I mean nothing surprised us beyond what -- we saw that coming, right? The sub-prime has been trending down for quite a while. So there's nothing that happened in September that kind of caught us by surprise. So we're satisfied that we have the right rate card in place. 
George Tong : Great. That's good to hear. And then secondly, software ARR growth accelerated to 22% in the quarter from 20% in the prior quarter. Can you elaborate on your overall software platform strategy and the traction that you're seeing with clients? 
William Lansing : Yes. The software strategy is going exactly as expected. We continue to penetrate enterprise platform customers. We've moved to -- we now have 55 of the top 300 financial services customers worldwide on the platform. And that's 55 what we call them EPCs, 55 of these enterprise customers who are using multiple use cases of the platform. If it's just a question of how many have taken the platform, that number is over 100.  And so we have pretty good penetration. As I've shared in the past, we actually expect that the expand side of land and expand is significantly bigger than land. So we land the business, and then our customers find all kinds of new ways to use the platform. And the expansion revenue typically exceeds the land revenue by quite a bit, and that has continued. And that's part of why we're seeing the success that we're seeing. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Margins. 
Ashish Sabadra : Just wanted to follow up on that point on the non-platform business. We've seen some pretty robust acceleration there compared to historical levels. There was a call-out on increased usage as well as CPI base pricing. On the usage front, I was wondering if you could provide any incremental color. Is there more modules that are adopted, more feature functionality? And how do we think about this sustainability of this accelerated growth in the non-platform side? 
William Lansing : I would say that most of that is from transaction volume growth. We do invest in features and functionality in our historical products and our legacy products. And so it is all about keeping them up-to-date and useful to our customers.  Again, as we've discussed in the past, the -- many of these solutions go into a customer of lending institution. And they might go in for a 3-year term initially, but they're typically renewed again at the 3-year mark and again at the next 3-year mark. And we can have these solutions operating for 12 years or more. And so it's incumbent on us to maintain the features and functionality, make sure the security is good and the functionalities that our customers want. We do all that. So we're pretty proud of our classic products. But I would say that the increase that you're seeing is largely just volume-related. 
Ashish Sabadra : That's very helpful color. And maybe just switching to the special pricing for scores for next year. Our understanding was that mortgage fees were different for Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 institution. And there's a potential for the Tier 1, Tier 2 to start paying the same cycle fees as Tier 3 for fiscal year '24. Is that assumptions appropriate? I was wondering if you can comment on that. 
William Lansing : Yes. We really don't go into the detail around the pricing within the segment. We have studied it, and I think that the price increases that we put into the segment are what are fair and appropriate for the market. We're pretty comfortable we've done the right thing, but we don't go to a lot of detail on that. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weber with Wells Fargo Securities. 
Seth Weber : For the last several quarters, you've talked about some shortening of the sales cycle. I'm wondering if that -- if you're continuing to see that dynamic and if you could maybe just give us some color on U.S. versus international. 
William Lansing : We are seeing shortening. I mean the sales cycle a year ago was over a year long. And today, it's 2/3 of that. We're very happy with that progress. There's a lot of reasons for it, but it's kind of the cumulative effect of us moving out the process and scaling up, and things are going faster.  I'd also say that the demand is really hot for our offering. The customers are really interested and they're in a hurry to get it going. And it's pretty easy for us to get it up and live. So all those things have contributed to a shorter sales process. And I would say that's true overseas as well as in the U.S. 
Seth Weber : Okay. And then maybe just going back to the expenses again for a second. The fourth quarter software expenses were a little higher than what we were expecting. Did that -- does that already include some of these new investments that you're talking to? Or will these investments be incremental to sort of this fourth quarter run rate? 
Steven Weber : Yes. I mean it's maybe a little bit incremental. We do have some onetime expenses, a lot of our -- around incentives in the fourth quarter that ramps up. And a lot of our people are in software. So you're going to see a little bit higher expense there. But our run rate is not going to increase significantly off of where we -- our exit rate from the fourth quarter. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. 
Jeff Meuler : Can you give us any sense of what you included in the guidance versus what you held back around pricing? For instance, last year, I think you talked about the original guide had the CPI-like pricing increases, but it didn't have the specialty increases. Just any way to help us kind of like understand what's assumed versus what could still be on the come? 
William Lansing : Yes. Jeff, I know you'd love for us to put a number on it. And you know us, we never do. And so it's not going to happen today either. The way we think about it is we look at the volumes, we make our forecast built around the volumes. We put on a CPI increase, and then we put what some people call special pricing, but we have some additional increases beyond CPI. And then because the timing of those is uncertain, we leave some of that out of the guidance.  And so call our guidance conservative. It's designed to reflect the fact that we just don't know how quickly the full-price effect will be ramped into our numbers. And so I hesitate to put any kind of a number on it for you. Is it safe to think about it the way we have in years past? Yes. So think about it the way we do it every year. We haven't changed our methodology. 
Steven Weber : No, I would say the only change is that there's probably more volatility in terms of volumes had in the past. So I mean, if you could tell me what the interest rate is going to be in 6 or 9 months, I could give you a better idea. But I don't think anybody knows that. 
Jeff Meuler : That's right. Okay. And then I guess I was surprised to see the departure of Stephany just given how well software has been doing for a while now. Can you just comment on just any, I guess, reasoning why there's a change now, when you expect to have a new leader announced, if they're likely to come as an internal promotion, external? Just any perspective on that would be helpful. 
William Lansing : Yes. Stephanie has done a great job with us. She's done a lot of good things for FICO and for the software business in particular. She decided to pursue other professional opportunities, and so we wish her well with all that.  We -- FICO graduates a lot of talent. I mean it's not -- Stephanie is not the first talent who's left us. And we have a really strong team, and I'm confident that our software business will continue very smoothly.  In terms of leadership, I'm taking over the leadership of the software business directly, so -- which is what I did before Stephanie took it over. And so I'm pretty comfortable with that. Might we have another leader besides me in the future? We might, but that's not the plan right now. So I'm going to run it for the time being, and we'll see. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. 
Manav Patnaik : Will, just on the software side, I mean, a lot of good numbers this quarter. You talked a lot about the visibility going into next year. So maybe just help us in terms of the '24 guidance. How should we think about the components of the software growth in there? 
William Lansing : Software business is growing double digit just like the scores business. I mean it's very strong. And where -- it continues to be strong. Where we haven't decelerated in any way in terms of our platform growth rates, which, as you know, were very high. And we -- trees don't grow to the sky, but we expect that to continue for quite some time. I mean there's a lot of demand. The pipeline this year is stronger even than a year ago. And so yes, we're very optimistic. 
Steven Weber : And Manav, the business has changed a lot from the days when we had -- when we were relying on term licenses. So now a lot of the deals -- a lot of the revenue we have visibility to because of the deals are already signed, right? We're just implementing them. So we'll be standing up more of these -- the recurring revenue in the coming quarters.  So we have pretty good line of sight to that. And then there's still a lot of people who are working with from the customer success side to expand their usage. So we're far less dependent on making sure we sign deals at the end of the quarter to pull revenue in. 
Manav Patnaik : Got it. And then, Steve, in looking at the EPS guidance, can you just talk about the assumptions there on -- just help us out with share count. I don't think you include additional buybacks, interest expense and maybe any other items that could change year-over-year. 
Steven Weber : Yes. I mean the share count, it's anybody's guess. So we kind of try to leave that relatively flat because that's just kind of upside for us. The interest expense, we've actually done a pretty good job of paying down a little bit of debt on the revolver, so we're saving a little bit there.  We don't have any big plans to really pay that down. We'll probably be maintaining that debt or depending on how the market works, we're sometimes opportunistic if there's a market downturn. So we're basically planning on that to be relatively flat, but we'll react as we always do, depending on what the market conditions look like. 
Operator: And there are no further questions. I'll turn the call back to Dave Singleton for closing remarks. Thank you very much. 
Dave Singleton : Thanks, everyone, for attending the call, and a great year. 
Operator: And all, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you very much for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-08-02 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Fair Isaac Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, August 2, 2023. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Steve Weber. Please go ahead.
Steven Weber: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining FICO's third quarter earnings call. I'm Steve Weber, FICO's CFO, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing.  Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business.  Certain statements made in the presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.  Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular, in the Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team.  This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through August 2, 2024.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
William Lansing: Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. On the Investor Relations section of our website, we posted slides that offer financial highlights for our third quarter. I am pleased to report we delivered another exceptional quarter with record revenue and profitability and strength throughout our business. Today, I'll talk about this quarter's results and our increased guidance for the full fiscal year.  As you can see on Page 2 of the presentation, we reported record revenues of $399 million, an increase of 14% over the same period last year. We delivered $129 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $5.08 per share, growing 38% and 41%, respectively, over the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $143 million, with earnings per share of $5.66, representing year-over-year growth of 24% and 27%.  We continue to deliver strong results throughout the business. Scores revenue was a record $202 million, up 13% in the quarter versus the prior year. As you can see on Page 6 of the presentation, B2B revenues were up 24%, driven primarily by increased originations revenues. Mortgage originations revenues were up 135% versus last year. Auto origination revenues were up 5%. Credit card, personal loan and other origination revenues were up 2%. On B2C, revenues were flat with last quarter and down 11% versus the same period last year. That was due to difficult comps.  In our Software business, we continue to drive growth with FICO Platform, which provides the power of analytics and AI to enable smarter business decisions at scale. You can see on Page 7, we delivered overall ARR growth of 20%, a significant milestone for us, and platform ARR growth of 53%. This represents our 15th straight quarter of platform ARR growth in excess of 40%. We continue to drive strong net retention rates as our customers continue to increase volumes and find new use cases.  Overall NRR increased to 117%, as shown on Page 8. Legacy off-platform NRR was 109% as volumes grew in many of our customers. Platform NRR was 142% due to expanded use cases driven by the success of our land-and-expand strategy.  And we continue to see strong demand for our software. As you can see on Page 9, we had another quarter of double-digit growth, with ACV bookings up 13% over the same period last year. We continue to see a strong pipeline of opportunities and are seeing strong demand for FICO Platform.  We had first-hand confirmation of the critical nature of FICO Platform at our recent FICO World Conference. This is a 3-day event, and it attracted customers for more than 60 countries where they shared best practices, learned about the latest in AI and advanced analytic innovations and learned new approaches for digital transformation. We talked about how FICO Platform can design, build and deliver AI-powered hyper-personalized customer journeys across every touch point and with every interaction.  Personally, I enjoyed the opportunity to meet our customers and hear from them how we're working together to optimize their most difficult decisions. One customer said, "I knew the FICO Platform had potential to help transform our business from a decision-making perspective, but I'm now blown away by the scope of the platform and communications capabilities." Another customer told us, "FICO doesn't sell software, you sell intelligence. That's way more valuable." And yet another customer simply said, "We either do this now or we fail forever." I'm proud of our technological excellence and the team that supports our customers to transform their business.  Finally, I'd like to say a few words about our partnership with Chelsea Football Club, where we're working together to empower students, adults and communities across the U.S. with financial literacy tools and knowledge to make informed credit decisions that last a lifetime. We are hosting fundamental workshops in partnership with the U.S. Soccer Foundation to empower the younger generation with the essential credit knowledge to jump-start their credit journeys.  Financial literacy correlates with better outcomes in education, but we know that the playing field is not always equal. One in 5 U.S. teenagers lack basic financial literacy skills. Around 74% of teams aren't confident in their financial knowledge. We're working on tackling this financial education gap to get more young people in the game.  In each of the 5 cities that Chelsea is playing this summer, we're working with local partners to bring teenagers from traditionally underserved communities to these fundamentals, workshops that are held on or near game day. The students will have an opportunity to attend the Chelsea football game taking place in their city.  For the wider community in these cities, FICO is also hosting Score a Better Future Credit Education events, which are free to the public and will provide local residents with knowledge and tools to gain better insight into their financial health and understanding of their FICO Scores. We know that FICO Scores have allowed much more equitable access to credit, and we're committed to helping educate consumers about processes to foster broader institution.  I'll have some final comments, including an increase in our guidance, in a few minutes. But first, let me turn the call back to Steve for further details.
Steven Weber: Thank you. As Will said, we delivered another very strong quarter in both our Scores and Software segments. Total revenues for the third quarter were $399 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year. In our Scores segment, revenues were $202 million, up 13% from the same period last year. B2B Scores revenues were up 24% over the prior year, driven by increased originations revenues.  We drove revenue increases in mortgage, auto and credit card personal loan and other originations. This quarter, mortgage originations revenues were up 135% from the same quarter last year; auto originations revenues were up 5%; and credit card, personal loan and other origination revenues were up 2% over last year. B2B Scores revenues were down 11% from the same period last year, again, due to difficult comps. B2C revenues have been relatively flat throughout FY '23.  Software segment revenues in the third quarter were $197 million, up 16% versus the same period last year. Software recognized over time were $147 million or 74% of total Software revenues. License revenues recognized upfront or at a point in time were $25 million this quarter and represented 13% of Software revenues. Our professional services revenues were $25 million, also representing 13% of total Software revenues.  In the third quarter, 87% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region, our EMEA region generated 8%, and 5% were from Asia Pacific. Our software ARR in the third fiscal quarter of 2023 was $646 million, a 20% increase over the period the prior year. Our platform ARR was $164 million, up 53% from last year and represented 25% of our total third quarter ARR compared with 20% last year. Our nonplatform ARR also grew very well and was $482 million in the third quarter, up 11%. And as a reminder, all of our ARR numbers have been adjusted for the divestitures we've made.  Our dollar-based net retention rate in the quarter was 117% overall versus 109% last year. We continue to show very strong net expansion from our platform customers due to follow-on sales of new use cases and from increased usage. The DB NRR for platform was 142% in the third quarter. Our nonplatform customer software usage also increased this quarter due to increased volumes and CPI increases. The nonplatform NRR was 109%.  We had another good quarter of software sales with ACV or annual contract value bookings of $21 million versus $19 million in the prior year, an increase of 13%. And as a reminder, ACV bookings include only the annual value of software sales and exclude professional services.  Total operating expenses in the third quarter were $222 million this quarter versus $208 million in the prior year and $221 million in Q2. Third quarter expenses included our FICO World event in May and a onetime reimbursement of third-party data implementation costs that were previously incurred in the previous quarter.  Our non-GAAP operating margin, as shown in our Regulation G schedule, was 53% for the year, a 400 basis point improvement over the previous year. GAAP net income this quarter was $129 million, up 38% from the prior year quarter and included a noncash reduction to income tax expense of $9.5 million associated with the valuation of our R&D tax credits. GAAP EPS of $5.08 was up 41% from the prior year. Our non-GAAP net income was $143 million for the quarter, up 24% versus the same quarter last year. And the non-GAAP EPS was $5.66, up 27% from the prior year.  The effective tax rate for the quarter was 18% and included the adjustment to the valuation of the R&D credit I mentioned earlier. We expect our Q4 recurring tax rate to be approximately 25% to 26%. That expected recurring tax rate is before any excess tax benefit or other discrete items. Free cash flow for the quarter was $122 million. For the trailing 12 months, free cash flow was $446 million.  At the end of the quarter, we had $195 million in cash and marketable investments. Our total debt at the quarter end was $1.93 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.1%. Currently, about 67% of our total debt is fixed rate. Our floating rate debt is prepayable at any time, giving us the flexibility to use free cash flow to reduce outstanding floating rate debt balances in future periods.  Turning to return of capital. We bought back 130,000 shares in the third quarter at an average price of $753 per share. At the end of the quarter, we had $237 million remaining on the current Board authorization, and we continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash.  And with that, I'll turn it back to Will for his thoughts on the rest of FY '23 and an increase in our full year guidance.
William Lansing: Thanks, Steve. As we finish our fiscal 2023 year, I am extremely pleased with the progress we've made in advancing our strategic initiatives. And I'm bullish on both of the segments of our business. Our Scores business continues to deliver strong growth, and we're dedicated to innovation to face industry challenges in the years to come. And our Software business, through FICO Platform, is enabling customers to use the latest analytics and AI technology to optimize their consumer interactions.  Finally, today, we're again raising our full year guidance as we enter the final quarter of our fiscal year. We are raising our full year revenue guidance to $1.5 billion. We are also increasing our GAAP and non-GAAP net income guidance. GAAP net income is now expected to be $428 million. GAAP earnings per share is now expected to be $16.90. Non-GAAP net income is now expected to be $500 million. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $19.70.  And I'll now turn the call back to Steve, and we'll take some Q&A.
Steven Weber: Thanks, Will. This does conclude our prepared remarks, and we are ready now to take your questions. Operator, please open the lines.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
Manav Patnaik: I was hoping, I guess, for my first question, if you would just help us walk through how you thought about the guidance changes. It looked like -- I mean, obviously, you raised it, but it didn't seem like it was the full extent of the beat. So just curious what you're assuming for the last quarter and the variability quarter-to-quarter, I suppose.
Steven Weber: Yes. You know how we -- Manav, of how we're pretty conservative with the way we guide. And we don't want to be in a situation where we feel like we have to close deals in the last week of the quarter to hit a number. So if we can get a better deal pushing into next year, we're obviously willing to do that.  So we're pretty conservative, and we don't go out and limit any of this. We typically don't guide quarter-to-quarter. As you know, we typically guide full year, and we will update in the middle of the year. So it's a big deal for us to raise guidance with 1 quarter to go, but we thought we pretty much had to. So you can take it how you want. But I mean, we are pretty conservative with where we guide.
Manav Patnaik: Okay. Fair enough. And then obviously the... .
Steven Weber: And I will say just one more thing, Manav.
Manav Patnaik: Sure.
Steven Weber: Manav, I will say that we did have some -- a fair amount of onetime license revenue this quarter that we probably may or may not have in the fourth quarter. So we don't want to count on that.
Manav Patnaik: Yes. Fair enough. Okay. And then just on the Scores business, I mean the mortgage origination numbers speak for your pricing efforts there. But can you just tell us where we are on card, auto and the other stuff, like in terms of the pricing strategy there?
Steven Weber: So I mean, they all had some pricing increases this year, probably more in line with CPI. In terms of volumes, mortgage is still down. We're seeing the same decreases that the bureaus are reporting. Auto was relatively flat year-over-year. And card's actually down a little bit. The originations this quarter are actually down a little bit. So we don't go into a lot more detail now, but you can kind of back into what -- we see the same things that the bureaus see in terms of volumes.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank.
Faiza Alwy: So I wanted to follow up first on the Software side of the business. You mentioned onetime licensing revenue. And maybe I missed that, but talk to us more about like what drove that? And I know you said you're not counting on that for 4Q. But what were some of the drivers around that?
Steven Weber: We had some renewals. We had 1 fairly large renewal. If you look at our point-in-time revenue, it was $25 million this quarter. That's a little bit more than we have been trending. So it's not that sizable, but that's a number that can have some variability from quarter-to-quarter. So I think it was $20 million a quarter before that.  So those things happen when they happen, and we don't want to be put in a position where we have to have them happen in specific quarters. So we're cautious with where we guide. And that's not much of our business anymore. It used to be 20-plus percent of our business, now it's 10%. So actually, it's less than 10%. So it's a small part of the business, but it's still a meaningful number when you're looking at 1 quarter.
Faiza Alwy: Okay. Okay. And so my next question is generally around the Scores business. So with only 1 quarter left, we're looking ahead to next year, and I know you're sort of getting to the time where you start talking about pricing for next year. So curious how you're thinking about that. There's obviously a lot of changes that are supposed to happen in the mortgage space, in particular. So talk to us about any initial thoughts you might have around pricing.
William Lansing: It really is a little bit early for us to talk about pricing. We're still thinking that through. But I think you can anticipate that there will be continued increases in price, where we think that the market warrants it, where the value we're providing demands it. And in terms of significant changes to the structure of the market and the structure of our pricing, we don't anticipate that.
Steven Weber: Yes. I mean, I think a lot of those time lines have kind of been pushed already. So we make the decisions based on the information we have at hand, but it's -- other than that, it's difficult to know what's going to happen when.
William Lansing: I think the thing to keep in mind is this is a big and very important market. And it's important that any kind of changes happen slowly, incrementally and with the ability to anticipate kind of how the market will behave. And so you can expect us to be good players as far as all that goes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies.
Surinder Thind: The first question is just around FICO World '23. The conversations that you have with clients there, how quickly do those conversations translate into signed contracts and then eventually revenues? And related to that, how big a source of new customers is that for you?
William Lansing: So great question. Thanks, Surinder. It's a tremendous source of business for us with existing customers and with new customers. And the speed with which it translates into business is it's actually quite a large continuum. We have deals that get signed at FICO World. I mean, we obviously try to close business on the spot, where appropriate. But then there's other things that just go into the pipeline and then we work the pipeline over the subsequent year.  Our pipeline has been getting shorter. Our pipeline used to be over 400 days. We're down well below that today and continuing to trend downward, which is a good sign. The thing with FICO World is it's really an opportunity for our customers to talk to other customers who have shared problems, shared experience and to really get kind of a real-world feedback from customers who've implemented our software, on how it's worked and what it's done for them and what kind of returns they can expect and the time lines for implementation and so on.  And because of the platform, in particular, is so successful, it's working so well, there's a lot of good stories to be told. And it's obviously way more credible when our customers are telling the story and acting as reference customers than we're out just selling our wares. And so FICO World is a very important event for us to be able to put customers in touch with one another. And frankly, they do the selling. We're there to facilitate.
Surinder Thind: That's helpful. And then a question about the FHFA time line for just switching over to the new mortgage scores. Any color there in terms of the conversations that you're having with customers or clients at this point in time just to understand whether the time lines are realistic? Are things already being engaged at this point? How should we think about the transition period?
William Lansing: I think that it's likely that the time lines will be extended. There's additional review going on. And there's obviously a lot of detail that needs to be worked out that wasn't completely worked out at the time of the announcement. And so I think all signs point to a more thoughtful and more drawn out time line.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kyle Peterson with Needham.
Kyle Peterson: Just wanted to touch a little bit on the guidance raise and kind of where you guys have been kind of seeing upside, at least, kind of year-to-date here, particularly on the Scores side of the business, I guess. Where have things maybe been trending a little better than expected. I mean it seems like mortgage has been notably strong since a lot of that is price. But I guess is there anywhere in the guide, at least, so far, where you guys have been kind of tracking above and is kind of part of what allowed you guys to raise today?
Steven Weber: I think just what allows us to raise is just more time has gone by, and there's less risk, right? I mean we've already banked 3 quarters' worth of numbers. So entering the year, even at the midway point of the year, there's a lot of questions, and we've gone through the Silicon Valley bank crisis. We've gone through multiple rate increases.  There's been -- if you go back to the start of the year, there's a lot of uncertainty. And we have 3 quarters less of uncertainty now at this point. So we still got another quarter to go, and we'll see. But obviously, we've generated really good numbers to date. That just gives us more confidence in raising the guide.
Kyle Peterson: Great. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up, really, on the platform ARR, another quarter of kind of 50-plus percent year-on-year growth. I'm really impressed to see. Are you guys seeing -- is your customer net kind of widening? It seems like you guys got a lot of traction with some international banks early, but it seems like that might be expanding a little bit or in other kind of related verticals.  But I guess, how should we think about the pipeline and your ability to maintain some of these really robust growth rates, specifically as the law of large numbers kind of kicks in and makes the comps a little harder?
William Lansing: The growth in the platform is coming from both existing customers and new customers. And we continue to add enterprise customers as we -- as they learn more about what we have to offer and as they talk to their competitors and see what's on offer. And then once it's installed, once implemented, most of our customers find additional uses and wind up increasing volume and increasing use cases over time.  So we're still early days, and we're still adding lots of new customers. Over time, in the fullness of time, I would expect that there'll be more emphasis on the expand piece than the land piece. But for now, it's kind of equal parts, we're seeing both sides of it.  And so, I mean, it's a good story. We have always said that trees don't grow to the sky, and we don't anticipate 50%-plus growth rates forever. But I will say that I'm very pleased that here we are in our 15th quarter, a very high growth for the platform and with no seeming signs of abatement. It's -- the uptake is tremendous. And certainly, our potential market, the potential use cases, very, very large. And so I don't think that we have to -- we're not worried about law of large numbers yet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs.
George Tong: You now have several months under your belt from when you raised prices in Scores at the beginning of the year. Can you provide an update on customer receptivity to overall pricing actions this year? And what credit volume assumptions for fiscal 4Q are reflected in your full year guide?
William Lansing: Customer reaction, let me take that one first. I think that our customers find lots of value in the Scores and what they do and recognize that they're a tremendous value. At the same time, no customer likes prices going up. And so as you can imagine, when we raised prices, we hear about it, and discussions go on.  And I think that the numbers speak for themselves. Our customers are very happy with the offering, with the product and with what it does for them. That's kind of how it goes. That's how it's gone for many years, and I don't expect that to change.  We don't -- we won't share our assumptions for next quarter. I think -- and honestly, George, I think I've talked about this before. The way we do this is we roll up all of our numbers and do a forecast and then haircut that with what we're willing to guide. So it's as a percentage of the total number we come up with.  So -- and there's a lot of things that go into that. So it's like running a mining [indiscernible] simulation, right? So we don't have 1 set of expectations for the next quarter. But again, we're conservative with the way we guide to make sure that we'll exceed.
George Tong: Got it. That's helpful. And then on the software side, ARR growth was very strong at 20% this quarter. Can you talk a little bit more about what's fueling that growth acceleration, particularly in this relatively tough macro environment? How much of the growth reflects large bank adoption of your platform solutions, increase in use cases, increase in usage or other factors?
William Lansing: We had some big deals with existing customers, and then we also added new customers. It's really both.
Steven Weber: And on the nonplatform side, we had good volume. Obviously, those numbers look good, too, right, so the ARR on the nonplatform side. We had some good volumes on the CCS side and some strong numbers in the Falcon Fraud side as well. So it's pretty much strength throughout the portfolio. And on the platform side, it's just the continued expansion. We had some customers -- big customers go live this quarter, and that's just -- it's new revenue, essentially.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird.
Jeffrey Meuler: Let me just pick up there. Is there some thought that the nonplatform business has some decent growth potential like you saw this quarter? And then if you could just maybe address if the license step-up in the large renewal was in platform or nonplatform.
Steven Weber: Yes. I mean, that's hard to say. I mean, we -- I think we had some pent-up volumes coming out of the pandemic, where there's some more activity here. I don't think the off-platform long term is probably going to be a significant growth driver for us. But it's nice to see those numbers perform fairly well.
Jeffrey Meuler: And the license deal?
Steven Weber: The license -- so the license deal was -- that was a legacy business deal. That was not on the platform. That was a renewal of a legacy deal.
William Lansing: It's probably worth noting that our legacy software is installed and it winds up having a very, very long life. And we just -- we'd see things renewed kind of every 3 years, and it could be renewed 3x, 4x, 5x. And so I would expect that for our current book of business and on the legacy side, we expect continued renewals, and we expect to be supporting and seeing customer interest in those -- in that software for a very long time to come, usually a decade.  And we haven't abandoned the software, just to be really clear, I mean, legacy has kind of a pejorative flavor to it, which it should not. I mean our legacy software is industry-leading. And it does what it does better than any other software in the market. And our customers know it, and they love it.  And we continue to spend money on innovation there. We continue to spend money, R&D, to make sure that the functionality is as good as it can possibly be. And so as Steve said, we don't look to it as a source of growth, but it's not shrinking either. I mean it's a very solid business.
Steven Weber: And just one more thing to add to that. So the license deal was a renewal of a term deal. So that's not included in the ARR. So the ARR was driven by volumes, essentially, on CCS and other -- Falcon Fraud, maintenance and volume. So the license deals that -- our term license deals are outside of that.
Jeffrey Meuler: Got it. And then I get that it's early to talk '24 pricing, but maybe if you can just talk about the '23 experience. Like you said, the numbers speak for themselves, and they speak loudly. '23, historically high pricing. So just what did you learn from the experience? And is there the potential that the '23 pricing level could be the new normal going forward after you have some time under your belt on seeing how it resonated?
William Lansing: Well, I think we'll have -- it's a little bit early to say, and we'll have to see how things unfold. But I think that you can expect continued growth in Scores in both from -- contribution from price and contribution from higher volumes that we anticipate next year.
Jeffrey Meuler: Okay. And then just last, could you just address AR, and if there was any sort of like new system you implemented, any change in payment terms or if it's just natural variability and when you'd expect kind of the step-up in collections?
Steven Weber: Yes. It really is not. What it really comes down to, for the most part, is Scores. And we accrue the new revenue, and it takes a while for the payments to come in, right? So you're going to get a little bit of a lag. When it jumps up that quickly, you have -- your AR goes up.  So I think we were asked about that even last quarter about the free cash flow. And we're starting to see more of the free cash flow, flow through now because the AR from last quarter is flowing through today. So it does take a while for that to -- because there's such a significant uptick that it takes a while for it to flush through.
Operator: And gentlemen, your last question will come from the line of Rajiv Bhatia with Morningstar.
Rajiv Bhatia: Just on the myFICO business, which you've talked about being a $100 million annual business. I guess, first of all, how much of that business is kind of consumer monthly subscriptions versus consumer onetime reports? And then secondly, how do you think about pricing and pricing elasticities for the myFICO business?
Steven Weber: I mean the bulk of it is subscriber. It's like monthly subscription. And it's like any other product -- subscription products, a little bit consumer. It depends on what you're selling them and what's involved when included in the package. So we have a really good team that works on that, and they do different packaging at different price points and do a lot of consumer testing.  So it's never static, it's never 1 product at 1 price that's automatically raised at a certain rate. It really is -- it's about understanding the consumers and what the consumers are looking for and bundling different services and products then with that and then testing different price points.
Rajiv Bhatia: And historically, how much pricing have you taken in that business?
Steven Weber: Yes, we came and looked at that way really because what we do is we end up bundling it -- different products in with it at different price points. So it's not -- it's rarely about a static product that's sold at increased prices. It's usually -- you add more functionality to it or add different tiers with more functionality or more products or services and then you charge more for that.
William Lansing: I think what's interesting about the business is that almost any consumer who wants to get a free FICO score today can get one. I mean, from their bank -- I mean, it's relatively easy to get your FICO score. And in spite of that, we have a lot of consumers are interested in managing it and monitoring it on a regular basis. And they come and they pay money monthly to subscribe and keep an eye on it.  And obviously, these are the people who are most focused on their financial health, and it's a good service for them. And this has been the case now for years. We've been providing free scores for many, many years now with Open Access, and it hasn't hurt the myFICO business. myFICO business is very strong.
Operator: And there are no further questions. I'll turn it back to yourselves for closing remarks. Thank you very much.
Steven Weber: Great. Thank you very much, everyone, for joining today. This does conclude our call, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thanks.
Operator: And that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-04-27 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Fair Isaac Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, April 27, 2023. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Steve Weber. Please go ahead.
Steven Weber: Good afternoon and thank you for joining FICO's second quarter earnings call. I'm Steve Weber, Interim CFO, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate the understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning those uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular, in the risk factors and forward-looking statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC on the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through April 27, 2024. And now I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
William Lansing: Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. On the Investor Relations section of our website, we posted some slides that offer financial highlights of our second quarter. I am pleased to report that we continue to deliver strong results with record revenue and growth throughout our business. Today, I'll talk about this quarter's results and our expectations for the rest of the year. As you can see on Page 2 of the presentation, we reported revenues of $380 million, an increase of 6% over the same period last year. We delivered $102 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $4 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $121 million with earnings per share of $4.78. On the Scores side of the business, we continue to perform well. Scores delivered a record quarter with $198 million of revenue, up 8% in the quarter versus the prior year, as you can see on Page 6. On the B2B side, revenues were up 16% driven primarily by increased originations revenues. Mortgage originations revenues were up 90% versus last year. Auto originations revenues were up 13%. Credit card, personal loan and other originations revenues were up 12%. Our B2C revenues continue to face difficult comps, and while up slightly versus last quarter, were down 8% versus the same period last year. In our Software business, our FICO platform provides the power of analytics and AI to enable smarter business decisions at scale. We're focused on helping clients maximize the customer experience by predicting, analyzing and optimizing customer interactions in real time to make better customer decisions across the enterprise. These better decisions build trust and loyalty by delivering hyper-personalized experiences through holistic customer management. And the strong results we're delivering demonstrated in the industry hungry for these solutions. As you can see on Page 7, we delivered overall ARR growth of 17% and platform ARR growth of 60%. This represents our 14th straight quarter of platform ARR growth in excess of 40%. Again, our customers continue to increase volumes and find new use cases, as you can see from our net retention rates shown on Page 8. Overall, net retention rate was 114%. Legacy platform NRR was 105% as volumes grew in many of our customers. Platform net retention rate was 146% due to expanded use cases driven by the success of our land and expand strategy. And we continue to see strong demand for our Software. As you can see on Page 9, our ACV bookings were up 16% over the same period last year. We continue to see a strong pipeline of opportunities as we help our customers to look at strategic mission-critical decisioning as they pursue their digital transformation. Finally, I'd like to talk a little bit about our FICO World customer event next month. FICO World attendees will be able to discover how to design, build and deliver a hyper-personalized customer experience across every touch point and within every interaction. Attendees will have access to schedule meetings with FICO's leading thought leaders and experts to discuss best practices and innovative solution designs to solve business challenges. General session presenters at FICO World include leading financial services providers from North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia Pacific. The conference will reveal new products, FICO score alternative data innovations, software capabilities on the FICO platform as well as the company's flagship solutions for AI-powered decisions. We will also announce a new partnership and other new FICO solutions. We'll talk more next quarter about the event and give more details about how leading financial services providers are using the FICO platform to design innovative solutions to solve business challenges. I'll have some final comments, including a revision of our guidance in a few minutes. But first, let me talk -- turn the call over to Steve for further financial details.
Steven Weber: Thank you. As Will said, we delivered another very good quarter in both our Scores and Software segments. Total revenue for the second quarter were around $30 million -- $380 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year or 7% when adjusted for divestitures. In our Scores segment, revenues were $198 million, up 8% from the same period last year. B2B Scores revenues were up 16% over the prior year driven by increased originations revenues. We drove revenue increases in mortgage, auto and credit card, personal loan and other originations. This quarter, mortgage originations revenues were up 90% from the same quarter last year. Our originations revenues were up 13%. And credit card and personal loan and other originations revenues were up 12% over last year. B2C Scores revenues were down 8% from the same period last year, as Will explained, due to difficult comps. As a reminder, that was an area that experienced outsized growth during the refinancing boom and peak in our third quarter of fiscal '22 and was up about 1% this quarter versus the first quarter of fiscal '23. Software segment revenues in the second quarter were $182 million, up 5% from the same period last year where we have -- and as a reminder, last year, we had a significant upfront license revenue quarter. Software revenues recognized over time were $136 million or 74% of total Software revenues. License revenues recognized upfront or at a point in time where -- or $19 million this quarter and represented 11% of Software revenues. Our professional services revenues were $27 million, representing 15% of total Software revenues. In the second quarter, 84% of total company revenues were derived from our Americas region. Our EMEA region generated 11%, and the remaining 5% were from Asia Pacific. Our Software ARR in the second fiscal quarter of 2023 was $613 million, a 17% increase over the prior year quarter. Our platform ARR was $152 million, up [ 60% ] from last year and represented 25% of our total second quarter ARR compared with 18% last year. Our nonplatform ARR also grew nicely and was [ $461 ] million in the first quarter, up 7%. As a reminder, all of our ARR numbers have been adjusted for divestitures. Our dollar-based net retention rate in the quarter was 114% overall versus 109% last year. Our platform customers continue to show very strong net expansion from follow-on sales of new use cases and from increased usage. The net retention rate for platform was 146% in the second quarter. Our nonplatform customers software usage increased this quarter due to increased volumes and PPI increases. The nonplatform NRR was 105%. We had another good quarter of Software sales with annual contract value bookings of $23.3 million versus $20.2 million in the prior year, an increase of [ 16% ]. As a reminder, ACV bookings include only the annual value of Software sales, excluding professional services. Turning on to expenses for the quarter. Our total operating expenses were $221 million this quarter versus $205 million in the prior year and $205 million in Q1. Much of the increase was due to salary increases, which took effect in December and [indiscernible] increases. We also had approximately $10 million of nonrecurring expense from a number of small items that were incurred this quarter. We will have some onetime expense from our FICO World event in the third quarter, but we do expect a run rate in the back half of the year to increase slightly from the current levels. Our non-GAAP operating margin, as shown on our Reg G schedule, was 49% for the quarter, the same as our first quarter of FY '23. GAAP net income this quarter was $102 million, down 3% from the prior year quarter where, again, we had a large upfront license deal. GAAP EPS of $4 was up 1% from prior year. Our non-GAAP net income was $120 million -- $121 million for the quarter, down 2% versus the first quarter last year and non-GAAP EPS was $4.78, up 2% from the prior year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%. We expect our full year 2023 recurring tax rate to be approximately 25% to 26%. [indiscernible] expecting recurring tax rate before any excess tax benefit or other discrete items. The resulting net effective tax rate is estimated to be about 24% to 25%. Free cash flow for the quarter was $88 million for the trailing 12 months. Free cash flow was $439 million. At the end of the quarter, we had [ $167 ] million in cash and marketable investments. Our total debt at quarter end was $1.92 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 5.1%. Currently, [ about ] [ 67% ] of our total debt is fixed rate. Our floating rate debt is prepayable at any time, giving us the flexibility to use free cash flow to reduce outstanding floating debt balances in future periods. Turning to return of capital. We bought back 170,000 shares in the second quarter at an average price of $684 per share. At the end of the quarter, we had $335 million remaining on the current Board authorization, and we continue to view share repurchases at an attractive use of cash. And with that, I'll turn it back to Will for his thoughts on the rest of fiscal '23 and our revised full year guidance.
William Lansing: Thank you, Steve. As I said in my opening remarks, we continue to deliver strong results, and I have confidence in our team as we move forward. Our Scores business continues to deliver strong growth even in a volatile macro environment. As I've said in the past, our diversification through different credit verticals means we're less dependent on specific types of lending, which is very important in a rising rate environment. On the Software side, we continue to prove that market demand for FICO platform is strong and growing. We're delivering valuable technology to customers looking to use the latest analytic and AI technology to optimize their consumer interactions and revolutionize their businesses through digital transformation and, importantly, to do it at scale and with low latency. As always, we're focused on execution and remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders and visibility into our progress. Finally, today, we're raising our full year guidance as we enter the back half of our fiscal year. There's still a great deal of uncertainty in the markets we serve, but we have line of sight to much of our revenue and are confident that we can raise our guidance accordingly. We are raising our full year revenue guidance to $1.48 billion. We're also increasing our GAAP and non-GAAP net income guidance. GAAP net income is now expected to be $406 million. GAAP earnings per share is now expected to be $16.15. Non-GAAP net income is now expected to be $489 million. Non-GAAP EPS is $19.45. And with that, let's turn the call back to Steve for Q&A.
Steven Weber: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we're ready now to take any questions you may have. Operator, please open the line.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank.
Faiza Alwy: Wanted to talk about the updated revenue guidance of $1.48 billion. Can you walk us through sort of what's changed? Are there areas of the business where you're feeling more positive about versus are there areas where you've maybe changed your view around?
William Lansing: Well, I think that it's not so much that things have changed as -- with the benefit of half a year behind us, we have more confidence in what we expected. And so we're able -- as you know, we're typically conservative in our guidance. And so we're really just stating officially that we're comfortable with the direction that things are headed. There's not really any surprises there, and there's not any dramatic changes.
Faiza Alwy: Okay. Understood. Maybe just a follow-up on expenses. Steve, I know you mentioned something about $10 million of expenses that were more onetime in nature this quarter. Just walk us through sort of what your expectations are for the back half of the year again on expenses.
Steven Weber: Yes. So we had a number of things that -- a lot of that may take place throughout the year. A lot of it has kind of happened this quarter. We included a little bit more for incentives, which we typically probably don't do to the third quarter. So we did that now. We had the success our sales events. We had a few other kind of true-up things that typically happen throughout the year, but we got more in this quarter. So the rest of the year, I mean, we have FICO World coming in our third quarter. So that's -- there's an expense associated with that. But we expect that, if anything, the expenses in the back half of the year will probably be similar to our second quarter or potentially even drift down in the fourth quarter because there aren't any onetime events there. A lot of that stems on the revenue we did, too. So -- but we don't -- it looks like there's a step function here, but it's not as much as it probably as it looks like on the surface because it's an aggregation of a lot of onetime happening in 1 quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
Manav Patnaik: Will, just a broad macro comment, especially since you're raising your guidance. Just a lot of your peers don't seem to be too worried about the incremental pressure from the bank failures and so forth, but I just wanted to see if you had any unique insight from what you're seeing and how you assess the risks here.
William Lansing: I wish that I had unique insight to share with you. As you know, our revenues tend to lag the bureaus. They tend to lag -- and so we're not a leading indicator. What we do see is sequentially from last quarter to this quarter, we've stabilized, and we seem to be moving upward a little bit. So that's a positive sign. But I wouldn't say that I have -- that we, FICO, have any kind of unique insight into the future. We certainly haven't felt any fallout right now. We're not sensing any fallout.
Manav Patnaik: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the originations revenues, I think we all have a good sense from the bureaus on the mortgage volumes. But I was just hoping you could give us some color on what auto, card and personal loan debt from a volume perspective this quarter.
Steven Weber: Yes. They were both up. Auto was up a little, not a lot, but it was up year-over-year and current results. We don't need all the details at the [indiscernible], but they were both up at least modestly.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kyle Peterson with Needham.
Kyle Peterson: Just wanted to touch on the software side of the business. The ARR, particularly in the platform side, looks really strong this quarter and acceleration at least in terms of the year-on-year growth rate compared to last quarter. I just want to see if you guys could dive into what drove that acceleration, especially kind of in an environment where I think there's a lot of speculation. The bank IT budgets could tighten just with all the ongoing volatility in the market.
William Lansing: Yes. It's a good question, Kyle. And certainly, the backdrop for IT spending and software is a little softer. There's -- but not for us. So the good news is that our offerings, particularly our platform offering, but our software offerings are so critical. And so March, a part of kind of the strategic future for our big customers that they're not getting the same kind of cancellation and squeeze that some other software products are. We're -- in fact, we've seen our sales cycle shortening a little bit. We see continued expansion of existing sales of platform. And we're actually running into less competition out there than one might expect. Most of the competition comes from homegrown. There's not really competitors out there who have offerings that are on a par with ours. Our platform offering is so much more powerful and fully featured and what the customer needs that it tends to be a less competitive kind of situation and much more of a strategic buy. And so that's really what we're seeing. And so no, we have not slowed down in spite of the software spending environment.
Kyle Peterson: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up on the software side of the business, particularly the talent side of things. I know historically, you guys have kind of been a bit supply constrained per se, kind of having a hard time selling seats in some key roles. Has gotten any easier, given some of the labor market changes, call it, in the last 6 to 8 months, particularly in white-collar tech per se? I just wanted to see if it's got a little easier and maybe a part of that contributing to higher expenses.
William Lansing: I'd say that we have never had any trouble attracting talent to FICO, not years ago, not last year, not this year, not even when times are tight, when employment is very tight. Yes, there are some salary and cost pressure. And I'd say that's more a year ago than today, but we have had no issues whatsoever with attracting talent or retaining talent for that matter. I think that we offer our engineers and our people super challenging roles. They're working on industries mediating critical stuff, and they like it, and we've been able to track great talent that way. I wouldn't -- with the exception of what Steve mentioned from a salary and stock comp expense standpoint, bonus standpoint, I wouldn't say that there's disproportionate pressure on conferencing or anything like that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies.
Surinder Thind: I'd like to start with a question on the Scores B2C side of the business. It looked like revenues were sequentially flat quarter-over-quarter versus the declines that you've seen in the last couple of quarters. Any color there in terms of the dynamic? Does it look like things have stabilized at this point and then maybe in terms of the new additions versus the number of people that are rolling off? Any color there?
William Lansing: I think things have stabilized. It feels like they've stabilized. For myFICO, we've had some success with a free program. And I think for our partners, volumes are stabilizing. So I think that's kind of the general picture there.
Surinder Thind: Fair enough. And then in terms of just the dollar-based NRR, obviously, there was a material acceleration in the figure from 130% last quarter to 146% this quarter. That reverses the slowing trend that we had been seeing. Can you provide some additional color there? How much of that is sensitivity to FX? And then how much of that is just like the international business there?
Steven Weber: Yes. Very little of it [indiscernible]. You've got to remember, this is a fairly small number of customers. So a customer coming out and really expanding their use cases can have a pretty dramatic impact when they do that. So I mean you're going to have volatility in both that number and ARR number. But I mean we're seeing pretty much crossed forward with our customers. As they start to use it, they find additional use cases and they drive more volume. So we're really encouraged by that.
Surinder Thind: And then one follow-on in terms of -- when I think about the new clients that you've been adding to the platform or the new use cases, that's consistently been growing at about a mid-teens pace. That was true last year. That was true this year. It was true through most of 2022. So it doesn't seem like there's really any impact from macro. You've kind of quantified it as there's maybe not a lot of sensitivity there given the importance of the platform. But can you discuss the conversations you're having with the new clients in terms of how you're quoting them? And what does that pipeline look like at this point? Like the conversions that you're seeing or that we're seeing now, is that conversations from last year? Or how -- when I say last year, meaning a year ago. Or how should we think about that in the current pipeline?
William Lansing: I would say the pipeline is as strong as it has ever been. So it's not like we're working off old pipeline from last year. I think that the future is every bit as bright as the present. So I would just -- I'd lay that out there. The conversations are strategic. So we're operating at a higher level in our customers. We're talking to Chief Digital Officer, the Digital Transformation Officer, the C-suite, the CIO, the Chief Risk Officer. The conversation has been elevated, and that continues to be the case. And I think the couple of things to distinguish our sales approach here are, one, we have something that nobody else has, which the industry very much wants. They want to be able to have this certain industry view of the customer and optimize every interaction and leverage all the data that they know about every consumer to make the smartest kind of an interaction we possibly can. And that's been imperative for the industry. And certainly, the biggest and most forward-thinking banks and lenders are already well down this path, and they see that we have the right offering for that. The other thing is the payback is very rapid. So unlike some of the software that we sold in the past were it'd be a long sales cycle and then it would be a long install and then the payback might take a couple, three years, and then it would get -- the license would be renewed for another three years and another three years. I would say that was kind of the typical software kind of approach five years ago. Today, the payback is extremely rapid. It can be within a year. It could be less than a year. And so what -- and it's very easy to get started. You don't have to commit to a monster project to get started. You can start with one portfolio with one or two or three use cases, see how it goes and then expand from there. And as a result, it's very easy for our customers to give it a try. And when they do it, they try it, and they fall in love with it, and then they expand. And so I think between the very rapid ROI, the very strong references we get from our customers who talk to our would-be customers and the strategic nature, I think those are all the things that are powering us.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs.
George Tong: With fiscal 2Q now complete, you have visibility into the flow-through of your Scores special pricing increases. Can you discuss the traction of your special pricing increases? And how much of it is reflected in your updated guidance?
William Lansing: If you're asking is there any special pricing on top of the guidance that we've provided, if that's what you're asking, I would say yes, there is, but we don't quantify it. I mean we really -- there's enough uncertainty out there that we'll know what the special pricing is at the end of the year when the numbers are counted. So I would -- the short version is there is some special pricing above the guidance that we've provided today, but I wouldn't want to quantify it today.
Steven Weber: Yes. And George, you follow the point out if you realize we're conservative with the way we guide, and we don't want to put the final point on anything. So we [indiscernible] we can. We'll provide more context when we can, but this is pretty much consistent with what we've done in the past years.
George Tong: And then aside from guidance, just in terms of what's the receptivity and what's the traction of your special pricing increases?
William Lansing: Well, they go through. We wind up publishing the new prices, and then they go through, and they flow through. And if there were -- if we were to face attrition because of the pricing, I suppose we would start to learn about it now, but we certainly haven't seen anything like that.
George Tong: Perfect. Very helpful. And then secondly, you mentioned auto and card volumes are up modestly. Can you describe what you're seeing with origination volumes from a trend perspective? How are they trending? I mean things getting better? Are they stable?
Steven Weber: Yes. Card origination is probably trending down. I mean it's very hot at the end of last year -- next calendar year. It's probably trending down a little bit. But auto has bounced around a lot. It's been pretty stable throughout the last couple of years. But pricing, you probably [indiscernible] data from industry sources that you're going to get from us. And again.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets.
Ashish Sabadra: Steve, maybe a quick clarification when you talked about the expense growth in the back half of the year. Is that increasing in the back half of the year? Is that excluding the $10 million onetime in the second quarter? Or doesn't include that?
Steven Weber: No. On a run rate basis, we'll probably be pretty flat to that $10 million or maybe that's probably the high end of what it would be, again, but a lot of kind of how much [indiscernible] get revenue over beyond our guidance. There's some products associated with that. But you can kind of back in on your model, if you take our guidance and see what's the implied expenses in the back half of the year. But personnel was up 6%. I think the personnel were not all that obviously is payroll increase and headcount expansion, so we had some true-ups of some incentives both in the U.S. and other parts of the world. So there's a little bit of -- and we have a number of different kind of onetime things that kind of gets that to $10 million number. So there's a lot of noise in the number. I don't want people to think that our expenses are ramping up that dramatically.
Ashish Sabadra: That's very helpful color. Maybe just a quick question on the FHFA press release that came out on March 23. It mentioned that it currently estimates the buyer credit implementation could occur by first quarter of 2024. I was just wondering if you had any thoughts on the implementation.
William Lansing: Your guess is as good as ours. It has always seemed like a somewhat aggressive timetable to us, but time will tell whether it happens at that time or later. But -- and one could imagine that it could happen on the time frame that's been announced.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird.
Jeff Meuler: So Software looks great. Look forward to seeing you at FICO World, I guess, next month. I do have another question on the guidance methodology. I just want to make sure I'm understanding it correctly. I think you said, Will, that like you took a similar approach to prior years. There was another question, and it didn't sound like the environment is all that different than what you were expecting. But the magnitude of the increase this year was obviously quite a bit less, at least at the EPS line than some prior years, what you did during Q2. So I'm not understanding if, like, you're holding back more of the pricing benefit this year given uncertainty or if there's offsets in volumes, you mentioned card getting worse or just anything like that? Or is this a pretty full view of the calendar '23 special pricing impact similar to what you've incorporated in prior years with a little bit of conservatism?
Steven Weber: Yes, I think it's probably more conservatism than we've had in the past because of so much uncertainty, right? I mean you go back a couple of years early pull guidance completely. So I mean there's a lot of uncertainty there. We have a fair amount now as well, but we're obviously dealing in a pretty volatile environment where a lot of our peers are funding their guidance. So we're trying to be as prudent as possible.
Jeff Meuler: Got it. And then just can you comment on free cash flow? I get that it could be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. I think we have a couple quarters in a row now where it's a bit lower. So just what's going on there? Or any sense of like when you'd expect that to normalize?
Steven Weber: I think it'll probably normalize in the back half of the year. I think what happens is you see it both in our accounts receivable. So I think as our Score revenue jumps up, it hit the receivables, and that takes a while hard to flow through to cash. So a lot of that is fairly late in the quarter. So I think you'll probably see a lot more flow through next quarter. There's nothing changing in any of that. So I mean if you look at overall period of time, you'll see [indiscernible].
Operator: And there are no further questions. I'll turn the call back to your presenters for closing remarks. Thank you.
Steven Weber: All right. Thank you all for joining today, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thank you. This ends the call.
Operator: And that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you very much for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-01-27 19:50:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Fair Isaac Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded Thursday, January 26, 2023. And now I'd like to turn the conference over to Steve Weber. Please go ahead.
Steve Weber: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining FICO's first quarter earnings call. I'm Steve Weber, Interim CFO, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the Company's filings with the SEC, in particular, in the risk factors and forward-looking statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the Company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the Company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through January 26, 2024. Now I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
William Lansing: Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. In the Investor Relations section of our website, we've posted some slides that we will be referencing through our presentation today. I'm pleased with the results we delivered in our first fiscal quarter. Even in these uncertain economic times, the resilience of our assets and the execution of our team allow us to deliver steady growth in both revenues and earnings and value to our shareholders. Page 2 shows financial highlights from our first quarter. We reported revenues of $345 million in Q1, up 7% from the prior year. Our GAAP net income of $98 million was up 15% over the prior year and GAAP EPS of $3.84, up 24%. On a non-GAAP basis, Q1 net income was $108 million, up 6% from the prior year, and earnings per share of $4.26 were up 15% from the prior year quarter. Overall, we are off to a very good start in our fiscal 2023. In Scores, revenues were up 5% over the same period last year, as you can see on Page 6 of the presentation. B2B revenues were up 11% in the quarter versus the prior year, driven by unit price increases, increased volumes in card and personal loan originations, and also by a license renewal in Latin America. In the U.S., auto originations revenues were up 24% and card and personal loan originations revenues were up 19%. We continue to see reduced mortgage origination volumes for the U.S. market, where revenues were down about 40% year-over-year. The fiscal 2023 price increases we talked about last quarter take effect primarily in January. So we expect to see much of the impact in our second fiscal quarter. As always, it's difficult to estimate the timing and magnitude of the impact. Our B2C revenues were down 6% versus the prior year quarter as we continue to see difficult comps in our myFICO business due to the economic climate and especially because of the higher interest rates and lower number of consumers preparing for mortgages. In our software business, we continue our focus on the decisioning platform that enables businesses to optimize consumer interactions across their enterprise. Overall software numbers look strong, and platform numbers continue to be exceptional. As you can see on Page 7, we delivered overall ARR growth of 11% and platform ARR growth of 46%. Our ARR, our DBNRR and our ACV numbers are adjusted for the Siron divestiture. And again, our customers continue to find new use cases, as you can see from our net retention rates shown on Page 8. Overall, net retention rate was 110%, and platform net retention is 130%, continuing to demonstrate the success of our land-and-expand strategy, and we continue to see strong demand for our software. As you can see on Page 9, our ACV bookings were up 31% over the same period last year, and we continue to see a strong pipeline of opportunities as customers look to FICO to deliver strategic mission-critical decisioning. Earlier this week, I had the opportunity to attend our annual sales meeting, where I met with colleagues from around the world to discuss best practices, current trends and especially how our customers view our offerings. I heard firsthand how customers were looking at FICO to help solve their most difficult decisions and how those customers were increasingly finding new ways to use the FICO platform throughout their businesses. I don't think there's ever been a time at FICO where the team has been so excited about the opportunities ahead of us. And I share that excitement. I came away with a renewed appreciation for our unique technological capabilities and the incredible team that we have taking it to the market. Finally, as I've often said, we are committed to becoming the preeminent platform player in decisioning analytics. The strategic focus has allowed us to exit some non-strategic products and services over the last few years. In November, we announced we had reached an agreement to transition our Siron compliance business to our partner, IMTF. We closed that transaction in December. While we are proud of the work and the innovation at the FICO team put into Siron to make it an industry-leading solution, we believe we are better positioned if we dedicate our focus and our resources to expanding the capabilities and market penetration of FICO platform. I'll have some final comments in a few minutes, but first, let me turn the call back to Steve for more financial detail. Thanks.
Steve Weber: As Will said, we delivered another solid quarter in both our Scores and Software segments. Total revenues for the first quarter were $345 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year and slightly ahead of our internal plan. In our Scores segment, revenues were $178 million, up 5% from the same period last year. B2B Scores revenues were up 11% over the prior year. As has been the case for several quarters, mortgage originations revenues were down from the previous year. This quarter, those revenues were down 40% from the same quarter last year and 29% from Q4. But again, that was offset by growth in other areas. Credit card and personal loan originations revenues were up 19% over last year, and auto originations revenues were up 24%. We also renewed a multi-year license, which had a positive impact on the quarter. B2C Scores revenues were down 6% from the same period last year, and we expect B2C revenues to be down modestly from current levels throughout the rest of the fiscal year. Software segment revenues in the first quarter were $167 million, up 9% versus the same period last year. Software revenues recognized over time were $133 million or 80% of total software revenues. License revenues recognized upfront or at any point in time, were $12 million this quarter and represented 7% of software revenues. Our professional services revenues were $22 million, representing 13% of total software revenues. This quarter, 85% of total company revenues were derived from our Americas region. Our EMEA region generated 9%, and the remaining 6% were from Asia Pacific. Our software ARR in the first fiscal quarter of 2023 was $583 million, an 11% increase over the prior year quarter. Our platform ARR was $133 million, up 46% last year and represented 23% of our total first quarter ARR compared with 17% last year. Our non-platform ARR was $450 million in the first quarter, up 4% when adjusted for divestitures. Our dollar-based net retention rate in the quarter was 110% overall versus 109% last year. Our platform customers continue to show very strong net expansion from land-and-expand follow-on sales and increased usage. The net retention per platform was 130% in the fourth quarter. Our non-platform customer software usage has matured and relatively stable with retention this quarter at 103%. Software sales were again strong this quarter with annual contract value bookings at $21.5 million versus $16.4 million in the prior year, an increase of 31%. And as a reminder, ACV bookings include only the annual value of software sales, excluding professional services. Turning now to our expenses for the quarter. Total operating expenses were $205 million this quarter versus $207 million in the prior year and $215 million in Q4. While we continue to focus on expense efficiency, we do expect our total expenses to trend up in FY 2023 from salary increases and modest headcount increases. Our non-GAAP operating margin, as shown on our Reg G schedule, was 49% for the quarter, representing a 400 basis point non-GAAP margin expansion versus the same period last year. GAAP net income this quarter was $98 million, up 15% from the prior year quarter. Our non-GAAP net income was $108 million for the quarter, up 6% from the same quarter last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 17% and included $10 million of reduced tax expense from excess tax benefits recognized upon the settlement or exercise of employee stock awards. We expect our full-year fiscal 2023 recurring tax rate to be approximately 25% to 26%. That expected recurring tax rate is before any excess tax benefits or other discrete items. The resulting net effective tax rate is estimated to be about 24%. Free cash flow for the quarter was $92 million. For the trailing 12 months, free cash flow was $471 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $166 million in cash and marketable investments. Our total debt at quarter end was $1.92 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 4.9%. Currently, about 67% of our total debt is fixed rate. Our floating rate debt is prepayable at any time, giving us the flexibility to use free cash flow to reduce outstanding floating rate debt balances in future periods. Turning to return of capital. We bought back 180,000 shares in the first quarter at an average price of $418 per share. We have $451 million remaining on the current Board authorization, and we continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. And with that, I'll turn it back to Will for his thoughts on the rest of FY 2023.
William Lansing: Thanks, Steve. I'm really pleased with our Q1 results. I'm pleased with the progress we're making on strategic initiatives, and I'm pleased with our positioning for the balance of fiscal 2023. Our Scores business continues to deliver growth even in a turbulent market. As I said in the past, our diversification across different credit verticals means that we are not dependent on one specific type of lending. On the software side, our platform strategy continued to drive strong results. The strategic mission-critical nature of our decisioning FICO platform means that customers are not delaying purchases and implementations. This is evident in the 13 straight quarters of 40-plus percent of platform ARR growth and the continued strong net retention rate of current customers. We are confident we have the best-in-class capabilities in an emerging marketplace that's poised for sustained growth. I'm confident we have the correct strategy and a strong team in place to deliver on the remarkable opportunities ahead. As always, we remain focused on execution, and we are committed to delivering outstanding value for our shareholders. As a reminder, when we announced our CFO transition, we also reiterated our guidance with an adjustment for the transition of the Siron Compliance Solution to our partner. So we are guiding revenues of $1.463 billion, GAAP net income of $401 million, GAAP EPS of $16, non-GAAP net income of $487 million, and non-GAAP EPS of $19.42. I'll turn the call back to Steve, and we'll be taking questions.
Steve Weber: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we are now ready to take your questions. Operator, please open the line.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we have a question from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
George Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. When you presented your fiscal 2023 guidance last quarter, you had assumed Scores revenue growth of 7% composed entirely of pricing increases and flat origination volumes. One quarter into fiscal 2023, does that assumption still hold on your end? Or are you seeing anything that could challenge those trends?
William Lansing: I think the assumption still holds. The future remains uncertain, but right now, the assumption holds. We think we're right on track.
George Tong: Great. Switching to the software side. ARR year-over-year growth accelerated in fiscal 4Q from fiscal 3Q, and you mentioned in your prepared remarks that customer demand remains strong. Can you, overall, just elaborate on the overall spending environment for enterprise software? And if you're seeing any second derivative slowdown in spend?
William Lansing: So as I mentioned, I think that because the platform software is so mission-critical, it's a little bit less subject to our customers pulling in their budgets and pulling in their spend. So there's no question that there is budget pressure out there. I mean everyone is under budget pressure. But the kinds of solutions we provide with the platform are such a perfect fit for the strategic needs of some of these customers that it's something that just can't wait. And so when the customers adopt a platform, it's a transformation of their business really, and it's not the kind of thing that's easy to put off. The other thing I would say is we're demonstrating incredibly rapid return on investment. And we have testimonials from customers with amazing returns, within year returns. And that word is getting around. Our customers are finding out that this stuff pays for itself within a year. And as a result, we have not seen any slowdown in the spend on our platform business.
George Tong: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Surinder Thind: Thank you. I'd like to start with a question on the Scores business. Can you provide any other additional color on kind of the licensing deals or the magnitude of that? When I kind of think about what volumes were, the B2B revenues came in a bit higher than I was anticipating. So any color on how licensing deals compare this year to last year in terms of the revenue impact?
William Lansing: I would say that the license deal that we referenced is kind of par for the course. We get these deals from time to time, renewal deals, sometimes they're bigger renewal deals. They happen every year. We can't really predict what quarter they happen in, and so we get a little bit of lumpiness there, and that's what we've got here.
Surinder Thind: Got it. And then in terms of the B2C business. I think you mentioned that maybe you're expecting some modestly lower revenues on a go-forward basis. Is the expectation just of sequential declines on a quarter-over-quarter basis throughout the year at this point? Or any color that you can help us provide on how to think about the amount of drag that perhaps there might be on a go-forward basis?
Steve Weber: Yes. Surinder, this is Steve. It's relatively modest that we see right now. I mean, a piece of that business is, as you know, there is a partner side and then the myFICO side. The myFICO side has been challenged by the economic environment, right. In fact that people and I getting pay mortgages, if mortgages increase in the spring and breaking them down and that increase that our business will probably pick back up again. But it looks right now, we're projecting it to be a little bit less than it is today, but we're not expecting to be [indiscernible].
Surinder Thind: Got it. And just a clarification on that, Steve. So is the partner side holding steady at this point? Or – and it's – the drag is mostly from the myFICO side?
Steve Weber: Yes, it's mostly on the myFICO side because the myFICO side is more – the partners have a lot of different business models they can cycle off to, right? There's a premium [indiscernible] MyFICO side, we don't set what market it is. It's a lot more tied to each market.
Surinder Thind: Got it. And then one quick question on just capital allocation. The stock has obviously performed really well over the past year and especially over the previous quarter. So does this still kind of make sense to be fully allocating all of your free cash flow towards share repurchases? Or should we start to think about maybe paying down some of the floating rate debt at this point?
William Lansing: We're still in love with our stock, and the plan is to continue to return capital to shareholders through stock repurchase. That said, we'll keep an eye on rates. And we're at a weighted 4.9% on the interest expense right now. And I just – when I look at FICO stock, when you look at FICO stock, I think you believe that's a better – that's a good balance. So for now, still on stock buyback.
Surinder Thind: Understood. That’s all with my questions.
Operator: Our next question is from Kyle Peterson with Needham & Company. Please go ahead your line is open.
Kyle Peterson: Great. Thanks, guys. So I just wanted to get your, like, sense of appetite. I guess, like you guys just mentioned FICO stock is really attractive. But how are you guys feeling about the buyback and capital allocation in this environment? And kind of if you could rank order, Steve, your like use of capital, that would be really helpful?
Steve Weber: Yes. Okay, Kyle, that’s a good question. So one of the things we're really working on hard, frankly, is we're bringing back as much cash as we can from around the world. Even if there's a slight expense to that when the rates are higher, it just makes more sense to do that as much as possible. So that we're bringing as much cash into the U.S. as we can. And then we look at the trade-offs between the rates and to put what kind of stock we can buy back. So as Will said, we're concentrating on buybacks, but that can change as the markets change. So we look at that, we model it out. And we're still comfortable that buying as many shares back as we can conceivably. We're not going to do like we did last year where we went all in, and we ratcheted up our debt when we said we had the opportunity. But I think you'll see us spending the free cash flow this year on buybacks.
Kyle Peterson: Yes. I mean, that makes sense. And I mean I think you guys went hog-wild on it last year, but like, yes, we're all about that. But I guess like just as we're thinking into the next year, is there anything different? Or should we expect more or less cash flow? I guess that the messaging from you guys historically has been, cash flow is – it's your money and shareholders' and not ours, and we want to return that if we can't find a better use of that. But is there any different messaging? Or is it more of the same with you at helm, at least for now?
William Lansing: Look, I think Steve said it well. I mean, we try to return free cash flow every year. And then periodically, we do more than that. So for the last two years, we've done considerably more than that. And it's because the stock price was depressed, like really, in our minds, quite depressed relative to its value, and also it was a lower interest rate environment. Now we have higher interest rate environment. The stock is a little bit price here. I still think it's a bargain, but it's more expensive than it was. And so we're back to thinking about stock repurchase in terms of our free cash flow, our annual free cash flow. So I would say that things have changed. I mean we were really piling up the debt to buy in the shares over the last two years, and we will not be quite as aggressive in the future, at least right now under these circumstances.
Steve Weber: And again, two-thirds of our debt is fixed. So we have no rate risk there at all, so even with the rates increasing. So we're just talking about the variable rate, and we're happy with where it is right now, but we continue to monitor it. And if rates were to go up significantly, then we'd probably pair back the buybacks. But it's always just the calculus we have to do.
Kyle Peterson: Yes. Makes ton of sense. Thanks guys. Nice quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead your line is open.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. On the Auto and Card side, you gave us – you showed some healthy revenue increases. But I was hoping you could just help us parse down what volumes are doing in those two categories? And the flat volume assumption for overall volumes in Scores, I guess what are you assuming for Auto and Card to get to that flat number?
Steve Weber: Yes. So right now, Auto is relatively flat. It's up some months and down some months, but it's relatively flat. Card is still up. It's been probably decelerating, but it's still up. So most of the increase year-over-year on revenues on the Auto side came from pricing. Most of the increase on the Card side came from volumes. Not 100%, but most of it was. So as we go forward now, next quarter, we'll have the benefit of the new price increases. So it – there's a lot of different variables in there. So it's hard to really say what we're expecting in terms of overall volumes because there's a lot of different tiers involved, and there's different pricing tiers. So you have to really dig under the covers to see all of that. But we're not seeing anything in the market that's really changing the way we looked at it when we issued guidance three months ago. Mortgage is probably a little bit weaker than it was then, but we knew it was going to be weak. So none of that really surprises us. We'll see how things progress in the next couple of quarters. If housing pricing comes down and the rates are down a little bit and that market picks up, then we'll get some more acceleration there. But right now, we're pretty much tracking to what we thought we would see three months ago.
Manav Patnaik: Got it. Helpful. And then, Will, just on the Software side, the platform business always had a five handle. Next is, in terms of growth, I know it's probably just nitpicking. This time, it's 46%, but even in your prepared remarks, you said 40% plus type growth. Is it just the law of large numbers? Is there something timing-wise? Just talk to us a little bit around that, please?
Steve Weber: It's a little bit of both. So we knew we were never going to be able to keep the 70% number, right? So now we've been 50%, now we're a little less than 50%. Looking at the rest of the year, we think we'll probably be in that high 40s to low 50s percent. So there is some timing around some of these things. But we don't see it really decline. I mean, it's declined for the last few quarters, but we think we're pretty comfortable operating in this range, give or take a few points.
Manav Patnaik: Got it. Okay. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Our next question is from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Ashish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. Just a question on the special pricing. Our understanding is that tends to be in the $40 million to $60 million range usually. Is that the expectation this time as well based on initial feedback as you have ruled out these special pricing increases?
William Lansing: We never confirmed that number. It's – and so I won't be doing it today. There is still some special pricing, but I can't confirm a number for you today.
Steve Weber: It's easier to do in hindsight. There's a lot of volatility, right, in the marketplace. So if you can tell us what the interest rates are going to be in six months, we can probably give you a better number.
Ashish Sabadra: Okay. That's fair. Maybe just a follow-up question on portfolio rationalization. Is it fair to assume that the Siron divestiture could also potentially help on the growth profile? And are there other opportunities for portfolio rationalization within the software portfolio?
William Lansing: I would say yes and no. So yes, our platform growth rate is substantially higher than the Siron business that we divested. And so divesting it does contribute to a higher growth rate for FICO. And are there other opportunities in our portfolio? Not really. I mean never say never. We're always looking to be as streamlined and efficient as we possibly can be. But we're pretty happy with the set of assets and the set of solutions that we have today. Even our older application solutions are still quite popular with our customers. We continue to invest in them and make sure that they have the features and functionality that the market needs. And as you know, the renewals on these typically have a cycle of kind of three years, and they get renewed multiple times. It could be a nine-year or 12-year kind of arrangement. And so I think we'll be probably hanging on to the vast majority of our portfolio. There are no obvious candidates for divestiture at this time.
Ashish Sabadra: That's very helpful color. And maybe if I can sneak in one last question on the B2C side. As you mentioned, some of it is tied to the mortgage weakness. But I was wondering if there's anything that you can do from a product perspective or a marketing perspective in order to improve or moderate the headwinds that are causing from the weak mortgage market on the B2C side?
William Lansing: Well, I can share you that our talented management team is doing everything they can on the marketing side and the customer acquisition side to keep the business growing as much as possible. But you do have a macro environment that just results in the kind of performance that you're seeing right now. That business is completely data-driven science-based kind of a business where we spend on customer acquisition up to where it ceased to be economically smart to do so. And so there's – that is always optimized. That business is optimized at whatever levels we have in the marketplace. And so the short answer to your question is we're doing just the right amount. I really think it's optimized. I don't know that more would make things better. You might be able to get the growth rate up, but it wouldn't be better from an economic standpoint.
Ashish Sabadra: That's very helpful color. Thank you.
Operator: We have a question from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Faiza Alwy: Yes. Hi, thank you. So first, I just wanted to pick on a comment that you made saying that you thought revenues were ahead of plan. Maybe you could talk about what areas in particular were better than your expectations in the quarter?
Steve Weber: Yes. I mean it was modest, but it was on the software side. I mean, the Scores number is pretty much dead on plan, and software came in a little bit ahead of plan. So it's encouraging to see that, that happen.
Faiza Alwy: Okay. Great. And then on the software side, I'm curious how we should think about the non-platform revenues. I think previously, you had talked about those revenues being roughly flat. And they are. They were down just a little bit on a year-over-year basis. I'm talking about the recurring revenue. Like is that – like – so that $450 million, is that sort of the right way to think about it going forward? Or do you expect sort of more – some declines from here in that business?
William Lansing: I think someday we will have declines, but I think for the time being, flat is the right way to think about it. Now obviously, we can manage that number. We choose to end of life some products, and that contributes to shrinkage. And it's a balancing. And it's really a balancing act that we are in. I think that we're in a good place right now at flat. That's just about the right balance where we can close down, end of life the products that would result in us having a lot of technical debt where we did continue them without really shrinking that business. The day will come, no doubt, when we will shrink that business somewhat. But that day is still a ways away.
Faiza Alwy: Got it. And then just on expenses. I think you mentioned that expenses are going to go up a little bit as we go through the year, mostly driven by personnel expenses. And I'm curious, is that something that's – something that's already put in motion? Or maybe want to talk about the magnitude of that increase, if you can? And secondly, like how much flexibility you have on that, should the planned revenues don't come in line. Is that something you can pull back on?
Steve Weber: It's not – it's not a lot of money. But I mean, we put – we have salary increases that take place in December. So we'll have three full quarters of that. There'll probably be some additions to headcount, but we expect to have more revenues, too. So I mean, we can delay the headcount hires if the revenues don't come in. So we do have control over it to some degree, but it's not a step function in expenses.
Faiza Alwy: Got it. Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question is from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: It is [indiscernible] on for Jeff. I was just hoping to get a little color on some of the nonorigination B2B scores, and particularly, the marketing and prescreen side of things. How is that trending...
Steve Weber: Yes. Prescreen is down slightly from last quarter. Some of that is seasonal. But we still see pretty strong pre-stream numbers, but they're not what they were in the fall. So we'll see what happens after the first of the year. Typically, that's a lower marketing quarter, but we monitor that, and we'll see. It's still strong, but it's not as strong as it was in the fall.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And then...
Steve Weber: In terms of the account management scores, the account review scores, those were actually stronger. So for – there's a lot of different factors looked on that, but it's a little bit stronger than it was in the prior quarters.
Unidentified Analyst: Appreciate that. And then on the software side of things, is there a usage component that benefited in the quarter? Or is it just strong growth?
Steve Weber: There's some usage. I mean, it's a combination. Most of the platform, especially, it's all based off the usage. So it can either be increased usage of the same functionality or additional use cases that are brought on board.
Unidentified Analyst: But is there like, I guess, a transactional or is there a revenue benefit to, like I said, the increased usage that's specifically...
Steve Weber: Yes.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Appreciate it.
Operator: And that concludes our Q&A session for today. It also concludes the call. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.

===== 2022 Q4  (2022-11-09 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Fair Isaac Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterward, we will conduct a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded Wednesday, November 9, 2022. And now I'd like to turn the conference over to Steve Weber, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Steve Weber: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining FICO's fourth quarter earnings call. I'm Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike McLaughlin. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate an understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve many uncertainties, including the impact of COVID-19 on macroeconomic conditions and the Company's business, operations and personnel, that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the Company's filings with the SEC in particular in the risk factors and forward-looking statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the Company's earnings release and the Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and the Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the Company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through November 9, 2023. And now, I will turn the call over to Will Lansing.
Will Lansing: Thanks, Steve. And thank you everyone for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. In the Investor Relations section of our website, we've posted some slides that we'll be referencing during our presentation today. I'm pleased to report that we had a very good quarter which completed an outstanding year with record revenues, record earnings, and record cash flows. We easily exceeded our guidance in all areas even after a mid-year raise. Pages 2 and 3 show some financial highlights from our fourth quarter. We reported revenues of $349 million in fourth quarter and $1.38 billion of revenue for the fiscal year. We delivered $91 million of GAAP net income in the quarter and GAAP earnings of $3.55 per share. For the full fiscal year, we delivered $374 million of GAAP net income and $14.18 of earnings per share. On a non-GAAP basis, Q4 net income was $112 million and earnings per share were $4.40. Full year non-GAAP net income was $454 million, up 19% over last year, and non-GAAP EPS of $17.22 was up 32% over the previous year. We continue to deliver strong free cash flow growth as well. Q4 free cash flow was $144 million, bringing the fiscal year total to $503 million up 21% from the previous year. Our strong cash flow allowed us to be especially aggressive in returning capital to shareholders through our share buybacks. In fiscal 2022, we repurchased nearly 2.7 million shares at an average price of $409 per share. In our Software segment, we delivered $175 million of revenue, up 5% from last year. We continue to drive growth in this segment, particularly on our platform. As shown on Page 7, total ARR was up 9% and the platform ARR grew 52%. We continued to deliver strong NRR as well, demonstrating our land and expand strategy as customers increase their total usage. Total NRR for the quarter shown on Page 8 was 107%. Platform NRR was 128% and we continue to see strong demand for our technology from new customers. Our ACV bookings as shown on Page 9, were up 14% over last year. We continue to focus on our state-of-the-art FICO platform, it truly is NextGen decisioning technology. It allows customers to use advanced analytics to optimize interactions with their consumers. In our Scores segment, we're seeing a continuation of the trend for the last several quarters. Mortgage originations have continued to decline and in Q4 accounted for just 11% of our Scores revenue and 5% of total company revenues. Auto originations revenues remained relatively stable with originations flat with last quarter and up 20% versus last year, primarily due to pricing. Card and personal loan originations continue to perform well with originations revenues up 37% over last year. Total Scores revenues were up 3% in the quarter versus the prior year and up 8% for the full year as you can see on Page 6. On the B2B side, revenues were up 6% in both the quarter and for the full year. This is a strong result considering the rapid and dramatic rise of interest rates and their impact on the mortgage market. On the B2C side, revenues were down 3% in the quarter due to a slowdown in new customer subscriptions on our myFICO platform and up 11% for the full year. I will discuss next year's guidance in greater detail later where we expect the Scores business to grow about 7%. We also expect the special pricing initiatives for 2023 to have an additional impact beyond our guided numbers consistent with those over the last several years. Although it's difficult to estimate the timing and magnitude of the impact. Finally, as you are aware, the Federal Housing Finance Agency announced that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have completed their validation and approval of new credit score models. I'm pleased the process has concluded and that the FICO Scores has again been approved for using conforming mortgages by the enterprises. This decision means that FICO Score 10T will be required to be used when available, as classic FICO is today for each conforming mortgage delivered to the enterprises. The latest release of our flagship FICO score, FICO Score 10T delivers increased predictive power while preserving the trusted and proven FICO score minimum scoring criteria. These improvements in predictive power can help mortgage lenders safely avoid unexpected credit risk and better control default rates. The decision from the FHFA is the culmination of a multiyear process set out by both congressional and administrative regulation. We look forward to additional guidance from the FHFA and the enterprises on the timeline and the implementation process. I'm also pleased to report that in our fourth quarter we signed a multi-year extension with the large bureau partner in the consumer Scores space. I have some final comments and provide our fiscal '23 guidance in a few minutes. But first, let me turn the call over to Mike for further financial details.
Mike McLaughlin: Thanks, Will. And good afternoon, everyone. As Will summarized we had another exceptional fiscal year and we are pleased with our momentum as we head into fiscal 2023. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $349 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year. Our full year revenue of $1.38 billion was up 5% over last year and up 8% when adjusted for the divestitures we completed in fiscal 2021. In our Scores segment, revenues for the quarter were $174 million, up 3% from the same period last year. B2B revenue was up 6% with growth in our auto scores and credit card and personal loans scores more than compensating for continued declines in mortgage score revenues. Our B2C revenue was down 3% from the same period last year, due primarily to the impact of fewer new subscribers on our myFICO.com platform, a trend we highlighted on last quarter's earnings call. For the full year, Scores revenues were $707 million up 8% from last year despite sizable headwinds in the mortgage origination space. Software segment revenues in the fourth quarter were $175 million, up 5% versus the same period last year. Full year software revenues were $671 million, up 1% from the previous year and up 9% after adjusting for our 2021 divestitures. This quarter 82% of total company revenues were derived from our Americas region, which includes both North America and Latin America. Our EMEA region generated 11% and 7% was from Asia-Pacific. Our Software ARR at the end of the fourth quarter was $569 million, a 9% increase over the prior year quarter. Our platform ARR was $114 million, representing 20% of our total fourth quarter ARR, and a growth rate of 52% versus the prior year. Our non-platform ARR was $455 million in the fourth quarter, which was 1% higher than the prior year. Our dollar-based net retention rate in the quarter was 107% overall, our non-platform customer's software usage continues to be mature and relatively stable with retention this quarter at 100%. Our platform customers are showing a very strong net expansion from land and expand follow on sales and increased usage. The dollar-based net retention rate for platform was 128% in the fourth quarter versus 143% in the prior year. Our software ACV bookings for the quarter were $30 million versus $26 million in the prior year. ACV bookings increased for the full year to $86 million versus $63 million in FY '21. As a reminder, ACV bookings include only the annual value of new software sales excluding professional services. Turning now to our expenses for the quarter, total operating expenses were $215 million this quarter versus $219 million in the prior year. In fiscal 2022, our expenses benefited from a number of factors, including savings from divested businesses, headcount reduction actions taken at the end of FY '21, somewhat elevated employee attrition, and significant operational efficiencies achieved in our software segment. While we will continue our focus on expense efficiency in fiscal 2023, we expect our total expenses to trend up modestly in the coming year. Our non-GAAP operating margin as shown on our Reg G schedule was 47% for the quarter and 48% for the full year. We delivered non-GAAP margin expansion of 800 basis points for the full fiscal year. GAAP net income this quarter was $91 million up 6% from the prior year quarter. Our non-GAAP net income was $112 million for the quarter and materially consistent with the same quarter last year. For the full year, GAAP net income was $374 million compared with $392 million last year. As a reminder, last year's GAAP net income included a gain of $100 million on product line asset sales and business divestitures. GAAP net income for fiscal 2022 was $454 million up 19% from the prior year. The effective tax rate for the full year was 21% including $9 million of reduced tax expense from excess tax benefits recognized upon the settlement or exercise of employee stock awards. We expect our FY 2023 recurring tax rate to be approximately 25% to 26%, that expected recurring tax rate is before any excess tax benefit and other discrete items. The resulting net effective tax rate is estimated to be about 24% in FY '23. Free cash flow for the quarter was $144 million. For the full year, free cash flow was $503 million up 21% from last year's $416 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $159 million in cash and marketable investments. Our total debt at quarter end was $1.85 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.4%. As you recall, we issued $550 million in senior notes last December, locking in a fixed rate of 4%. Currently, about 70% of our total debt is fixed rate. Our floating rate debt is pre-payable at any time giving us the flexibility to use free cash flow to reduce outstanding floating rate debt balances if it is financially advantageous for us to do so in future periods. Turning to return of capital, we bought back 120,000 shares in the fourth quarter at an average price of $468 per share. In fiscal 2022, we repurchased a total of 2,678,000 shares at an average price of $409 per share for a total of $1.1 billion. The Board approved a new $500 million authorization in October and we continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. With that, I will turn it back over to Will for his thoughts on FY '23.
Will Lansing: Thanks, Mike. As we enter our fiscal 2023, I'm excited about our prospects and opportunities that lie ahead. We have an incredible set of assets and a business model that can produce predictable solid results even in a turbulent macro environment. Our FICO platform continues to experience phenomenal growth as we find a receptive audience for best-in-class decisioning that our panelists deliver. Our Scores business continues to deliver industry-standard risk management products that are especially critical in uncertain economic times. And the recent FHFA decision ensures that we'll be a critical component in the mortgage process for many years to come. The successful deal signings we had in fiscal '22, as well as prudent planning and management, give us confidence, we will have another successful year in fiscal '23. We are providing full year guidance as shown on the presentation. Regarding revenues of approximately $1.475 billion, an increase of 7% versus fiscal 22. We are guiding GAAP net income of approximately $401 million, an increase of 7.5%. GAAP earnings per share of approximately $16, an increase of 13%. Non-GAAP net income of $487 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $19.42, increases of 7.5% and 13% respectively. With that, I'll turn it back over to Steve and we'll take questions.
Steve Weber: Thanks, Will. This does conclude our prepared remarks. And we're now ready to take any questions you may have. Operator, please open the lines.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We do have a question from the line of Kyle Peterson with Needham & Company. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Sam Salvas: This is actually Sam Salvas on for Kyle today. Thanks for taking the questions, and nice results here. I wanted to start out on the software side of the business. It seems like things are still going well here. But wanted to get a sense if you guys could talk a little bit more about demand here, maybe specifically on the international side, are you guys seen any deals get pushed out or any deals being downsized given the current macro environment?
Will Lansing: We are not seeing deals pushed out nor are we seeing deals downsized. It's probably worth noting that we have a fairly long sales cycle, it's approximately a year long. And so it's long enough in our view. But we have not seen softness. No, I think that the current solutions and offerings particularly around the platform are really strategic. And the - and our customers see them that way and it's a higher-level decision. And so whatever financial pressure our customers may be under, our deals with them seem not to be affected.
Sam Salvas: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up. I was wondering if you guys could talk a little bit more about the volumes you guys have been seeing on the Scores side of the business, as far as the different segments? And maybe talk a little bit about how you guys are feeling about credit card and mortgage, auto as we head into 2023? Thanks.
Mike McLaughlin: Hi, Sam, it's Mike. As in past quarters, we don't disclose volumes precisely. But also as in past quarters, I can tell you that the volumes we saw are pretty consistent with what you have seen if you've been watching the third-party data out there from either the NBA or J.D. Power or credit card issuers themselves. Mortgage has declined for us in volume in a quantity consistent with what you can see from some of those data points. Auto was more or less flat both on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis, again consistent with external reporting. And on the credit card side, growth continued to be strong on a year-over-year basis. It was more or less flat on a quarter-over-quarter basis but consistent with the market. In terms of how we feel going forward, we don't make predictions about volumes in those sectors, we don't have economists that don't necessarily consider ourselves experts in forecasting that kind of consumer behavior. But I think you can have some confidence that our volumes will pretty much track the overall market as it has in past quarters.
Operator: Next question is from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
John Mazzoni: This is John filling in for Ashish. Maybe just a follow-up on the ACV bookings, 14% was very strong. Is there anything that's driving that strength or is this more of seasonal element? Thanks.
Mike McLaughlin: Well, we have a lot of quarter-to-quarter variability in the ACV bookings as you can see from our data. And our ACV bookings tend to be fourth quarter weighted. This year was a little less fourth quarter weighted than the last year. So I would encourage you to look at the year - at the full year comparison, not so much the quarter-over quarter because one quarter doesn't make a trend. Our year-over-year growth in ACV bookings as we talked about over 30%, and it reflects the underlying strength in a variety of areas of our business, our platform business, our customer communication business, as well. And the guidance that we have for next year is not heroic in terms of the amount of new ACV bookings we need to deliver relative to the past year.
John Mazzoni: Great. Thank you. And then maybe just quickly, could you give us some more color on the slow-down in marketing, and as well as the shift to freemium and how it's weighed on B2C? And perhaps how we could think about B2C revenue growth going forward? Thanks.
Will Lansing: Yes. What do you mean by slowdown in marketing?
John Mazzoni: So just based on some of our math, it looks like we might have a slowdown in marketing and account management, but we might be a bit off there. Is that the case?
Mike McLaughlin: Okay. So you're talking about the Scores side of the business and sale of our Scores used for marketing or pre-screening purposes, is that correct?
John Mazzoni: Yes. That would be great.
Mike McLaughlin: Okay. Got you. Yes, as with last quarter, we've seen a flattening of the growth in the sale of that type of Score, the pre-screening of pre-score sale. In fact. it was down a little bit this quarter on a quarter-over-quarter basis. And we do think it's somewhat of a leading indicator as to how much credit particularly credit card and personal loan, credit lenders want to extend in future periods. We've never analyzed precisely how predictive it is consistent with what we're seeing in the macro, the demand for that kind of a score was down a little bit on a quarter-over-quarter basis for us.
Operator: Our next question is from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Brendan Popson: This is Brendan on for Manav. Just wanted to ask on guidance. 7% growth for Scores. Obviously, didn't quite you have this quarter and there is some macro - certainly more macro concerns for next year. You talk about flattening in marketing and that can be a leading indicator. It seems like there are some negatives, but at the same time, it's pretty good - it's a pretty good, pre-year guidance, and, of course, that doesn't include pricing. So I guess what gives you the confidence for that and whether the puts and takes driving that 7%?
Will Lansing: Yes, good question. So just starting with the special pricing. The special pricing is in addition to our guidance, it's not in that 7% exactly. It's really - think of it as being consistent with past years and outside of our guidance because we can't really predict the timing and so on. With respect to within the guidance, the 7%, we have a fairly significant CPI increase there which in years past has been there as well but it was always a much smaller number. This year we're talking about a reasonably significant number which is driving a fair bit of that. And also, I would say that mortgages it's a smaller piece of our business. And so we feel pretty good about the overall mix.
Brendan Popson: Okay. And then looking at how that translates down to the bottom line, pretty good EPS number. Is there - is it - could you comment any on margins or I guess you guys have commented on expenses. But is it just you expect a strong flow through and or is there something else contemplated, it seem like the EPS was a good amount above net income and I don't know if it's that - like the growth rate. I don't know if that's just from the repurchases in the back half of this year or if you can detail about that.
Will Lansing: It's a bit of both. I mean so, we're clearly holding the line on expenses, but it's also a smaller share count, they're both contributors.
Mike McLaughlin: Yes. I mean, just to add to that. We expect to grow revenues faster than expenses, it's kind of that simple. And we have reduced share count by such a degree that the EPS growth is going to be faster than net income growth.
Brendan Popson: Okay. And there is no - are there any repurchases assumed in '23 in that number?
Will Lansing: Yes. We anticipate repurchasing shares at a pace more or less consistent with our free cash flow generation for the year.
Operator: Our next question is from Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Surinder Thind: Thank you. Following up on the - perhaps the first question that was asked about the demand environment in software. Can you provide any color in terms of the new conversations that you might be having with clients given that the sales cycle is long obviously, there is an ability to kind of take advantage of that linked period. But what about new conversations? Are you able to kind of bring new clients to the table to start those conversations? Or how should we be thinking about that part of the pipeline - 
Will Lansing: Yes. We absolutely are. So we think of our target market as the top 200 financial institutions globally. And our penetration there is around 15%, little over 30 customers signed through the platform. And so our conversation takes two forms. One is, let's talk to the other 85% of our target market that has not yet signed up for the platform, as well as expansion opportunities with the ones who already have. And both of those kind of conversations are going on, and very successfully.
Surinder Thind: Got it. That's helpful. And then on the B2C piece, any additional color you can provide there in terms of - it sounds like, the weakness I guess within the myFICO.com parts. Any color on how the revenues are trending within your relationship partner?
Will Lansing: So consumer B2C does have - does move in sympathy with mortgage volumes because as you know consumers tend to sign-up for that kind of subscription, with contemplating mortgages when they are wondering what their FICO score is going to be for them when they go out and get financing. So as mortgage volumes go down so to - with a little bit of a lag with so to do our B2C myFICO volumes. Our volumes are - they're good, they're down a little bit, they're good. And same with our partners, our partners are - they're doing okay.
Surinder Thind: Fair enough. And then in terms of just, when we kind of breakdown the guidance on - into kind of the Scores and suffer for next year, it looks like you're looking for about roughly equal growth. You've talked about the CPI component. Is there also an anticipation of just volume growth here or how should we think about the mix at this point in terms of - it seems like right now card remains quite strong and you can argue that auto is probably near trough, so maybe there is improvement there. But how are you generally - what kind of an environment is kind of baked into those assumptions? Is it just a little bit of a continuation of what we're currently seeing or how should we think about the various macro factors that might influence the underlying assumptions there?
Will Lansing: I think a fair way to think about it is a bit of a continuation of what we're currently seeing. So flattish, modest, very modest kind of growth and the balance is made-up with price.
Surinder Thind: Okay.
Will Lansing: And the fact that we have a price lever makes a huge difference, it's part of why we have the confidence that we have.
Surinder Thind: And at this point in time, I assume the special pricing term sheets all of that's been communicated?
Will Lansing: Yes. Although, it hasn't taken effect. Yes.
Surinder Thind: Okay. Correct. It will take effect I assume January 1. Correct?
Will Lansing: For most, but not all customers. Yes.
Operator: Our next question is from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
George Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. In your guidance for next year, can you outline what you're assuming for B2C growth in the Scores business?
Mike McLaughlin: Yes. We don't want to get into too much detail around that. But consistent with Will's prior comment about more or less think about it as a continuation of the trends we're seeing. We've seen B2C down a little bit sequentially over the last couple of quarters and that's consistent with how we're thinking about the full year for '23.
George Tong: Great. And then with respect to margins, how much of the margin expansion that you're forecasting for next year is going to come from Scores versus software? Are you expecting more contribution from one part of the business over the other or is it relatively equal benefit from both?
Mike McLaughlin: Sorry. Could you say again, I think I missed the first part of it?
George Tong: Just trying to get a sense for how much of the margin expansion next year will be driven by software versus by Scores?
Mike McLaughlin: I see margin expansion. As we've talked about extensively in the past on the software - in the software business, our focus is on the platform and driving growth there. So we're not focused on dramatic margin improvement in the software business, we might have a little bit. But we're mostly focused on growth of the platform. In the Scores business, due to the gross margin nature of that business, relative to expense growth most of the dollar growth you see there, a lot of it falls to the bottom line. So in terms of contribution to operating margin expansion, it's weighted towards the Scores business for sure.
Operator: Our next question is from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Jeff Meuler: Yes. Thank you. The multi-year extension with the large bureau partner, is that a B2C partnership or what was that? Was that something other than that?
Will Lansing: No, that is the B2C partnership which as I think we shared in the past had a couple of more years to run. And what we've done is extended another few years beyond that. And so we now have a lot of certainty around when that B2C partnership looks like for many years to come.
Jeff Meuler: Got it. And then for the CPI pricing in Scores, how is that implemented? Like is it formulaic tied to CPI or do you kind of dictate an amount that is influenced by CPI? Just want to understand how that takes effect.
Will Lansing: It's more the latter. Because as you know the CPI numbers are constantly moving and we could pick a number that's a point in time number that would be exactly the CPI. We could pick a rolling number, we could do a historical number, we could do a projection. And so we never get it exactly right. So we think our best guess and put down a number, but it's our interpretation.
Jeff Meuler: Okay. And then for the non-U.S. based clients in software how much of that is contracted in U.S. dollar? And to the extent to which it is, is there any market reaction in some of the markets where their currencies have been particularly weak relative to the dollar recently?
Will Lansing: It's it is mostly U.S. dollars, and it's not a new thing for our customers to prefer to operate in their own currency and it's not a new thing for us to prefer to operate in U.S. dollars. So we kind of are where we are. And so yes, you can imagine that for them based on the strength of the dollar it's a little bit tougher. But we haven't changed our policies.
Mike McLaughlin: And that varies from geography to geography. So for example in Brazil, we're priced in Real for the most part. In the U.K., likewise pretty much priced in pounds, in the euro, it's mixed in sort of second and third world countries, it's dollar.
Jeff Meuler: Got it. And then just last we have the K and we get the client comp disclosure. Just any comment on the number of large financial institutions. So I guess in the U.S. went down from 96 to 92, are those software or Scores clients or is there an impact from - I don't remember the exact timing of the collection and recovery divestiture. And then it looks like a good news story internationally. I don't know how much this is rounding, but going from two-thirds to three quarters. Just any comment on those our client count metric?
Will Lansing: I wouldn't read too much into that, Jeff. In the U.S. consolidation is something that we can't control that often reduces just the number of logos we have. And any change in the names - the number of logos would primarily be a function of software. We don't - everybody uses the FICO score essentially, among the large financial institutions, so that doesn't change. But there is not a trend that I would read into that. Internationally, there we do see new logos because there's a lot more greenfield internationally for us than in the U.S.
Operator: I believe that's all the questions we have. I'll turn the call back over to Steve.
Steve Weber: Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for joining. And we look forward to speaking with you again soon or at the earliest next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: That concludes the call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-08-03 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Fair Isaac Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Wednesday, August 3, 2022. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Weber. Please go ahead, sir.
Steve Weber: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining FICO’s third quarter earnings call. I’m Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I’m joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike McLaughlin. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties, including the impact of COVID-19 on macroeconomic conditions and the company’s business, operations and personnel, that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company’s filings with the SEC, in particular, in the risk factors and forward-looking statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company’s earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company’s website at fico.com or on the SEC’s website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through August 3, 2023. And now, I’ll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
Will Lansing: Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. We posted some slides with our results on the Investor Relations section of our website. I’ll be referencing some of those slides during our presentation today. I’ll go over the results of our third fiscal quarter and discuss what we’re seeing in the markets we serve. We again delivered very strong results in a noncertain marketplace, which demonstrates the resiliency of our business model and the value proposition we deliver. As you can see on Page 2 of the presentation, we reported revenues of $349 million, an increase of 3% over the same period last year or 7% when adjusted for last year’s sale of our collections and recovery products. We delivered $93 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $3.61 per share, up 21% and 36%, respectively, when adjusted for last year’s gain on sale. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $116 million, up 17%, and earnings per share of $4.47 was up 32% from last year. Our Scores business continues to perform well despite headwinds in the mortgage market. Scores were up 4% in the quarter versus the prior year, as you can see on Page 6 of the presentation. On the B2B side, revenues were up 3%. Mortgage continues to be the headwind as originations have declined as interest rates rise. Mortgage originations revenues were down 25% versus last year. Mortgage origination revenues now account for about 12% of our Scores revenues and 6% of our total company revenues. Excluding mortgage, total B2B revenues were up about 12% versus last year. Auto origination revenues were up 12%, and credit card and personal loan originations revenues were up 37%. We also had double-digit year-over-year increases in our prescreen scores. On the B2C side, revenues were up 7% from the previous year. The slowdown in growth came primarily in our direct myFICO.com channel, where we are seeing fewer new customers coming online. Our partner channel, which includes paid and freemium components, continues to drive double-digit growth. In our Software segment, we delivered $170 million of revenue, up 2% from last year and 11% after adjusting for the divestiture. As you know, over several quarters, we’ve talked about the demand for our platform and how we see substantial growth opportunities. As shown on Page 7, total ARR was up 9%, and the Platform ARR again grew at a remarkable 60%. Our net retention rate is also very strong as our existing customers continued to expand their usage. Total NRR for the quarter, shown on Page 8, was 108%. Platform NRR was 135%. We also had a very good quarter with new sales. Our ACV bookings, as shown on Page 9, was up 64% over last year. We’re extremely excited about the continued growth potential for our FICO platform, and that excitement was shared by our customers at our recent FICO World Conference. The 3-day event hosted in May was an opportunity to finally connect face-to-face with our clients, partners, industry experts and colleagues to reinforce FICO’s vision and commitment to client success. We hosted 750 FICO clients from leading banks, financial services firms, auto finance companies, insurance providers and telcos. The event in Orlando included 90 breakout sessions as well as hundreds of individual strategic consulting engagements, all designed to help our customers identify how FICO can enable them to accelerate and achieve their goals with the FICO platform. It was also a great opportunity here from FICO customers, with nearly 70 clients presenting during breakout sessions, sharing the success stories and lessons learned. FICO World ‘22 was an essential moment where we had the opportunity to explain and demonstrate our platform strategy directly to our most strategic clients. Clients rated this FICO World the best FICO World of all past events, and we’ve already seen a surge in registrations for the next FICO World, to be held May 13 through 16 in Hollywood, Florida. I’ll have some final comments in a few minutes. But first, let me turn the call back over to Mike for financial details.
Mike McLaughlin: Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered another quarter of strong results and remain confident that we can deliver on the increased guidance we issued last quarter. Total revenue for the third quarter was $349 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year or 7% after adjusting for the divestiture of our Collections and Recovery product line last June. In our Scores segment, revenues were $179 million, up 4% from the same period last year. B2B Scores revenue was up 3% over the prior year. As Will mentioned, we continue to see a decline in mortgage origination revenues, which were down 25% from the same quarter last year. However, other parts of the portfolio continue to be strong. Credit card and personal loan originations revenues were up 37%, and originations revenues and auto originations revenues were up 12%. And we continue to see nice growth in our prescreen scores, which is a good sign for continued strength in credit card originations. B2C Scores revenues were up 7% from the same period last year driven by strong growth from our partner channel. FICO’s Software segment revenues in the third quarter were $170 million, up 2% versus the same period last year or 11% after adjusting for the divestiture of our Collections and Recovery business. Software license revenue recognized upfront or at a point in time was $21 million -- was $20 million in the quarter compared to $13 million in the same period last year. As a reminder, these point-in-time revenues are a result of GAAP accounting rules that require us to recognize upfront a portion of the total contract value of multiyear on-premise software license subscription sales and renewals. Point-in-time revenues will vary from quarter-to-quarter driven primarily by the mix of on-premise versus SaaS subscription sales. It’s important to note that our ARR metric is not impacted by these point-in-time revenue accounting rules. As expected, we continue to see lower Software professional services revenues. Those revenues were $27 million this quarter, up slightly from last quarter, but down 24% from the same period last year, much of it due to last year’s divestiture. This quarter, 84% of total company revenues were derived from our Americas region. Our Asia Pacific region generated 5%. And the remaining 11% was from EMEA. Our Software ARR at the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2022 was $561 million, a 9% increase over the prior year quarter. Our Platform business continues to perform extremely well. Platform ARR was $108 million, representing 19% of our total third quarter ARR, with a growth rate of 60% versus the prior year. Our non-Platform ARR was $453 million in the quarter, up 1% from the prior year. As a reminder, our reported ARR and related metrics exclude all revenues from divestitures in prior periods. Our dollar-based net retention rate in the quarter was 108% overall. Again, we’re seeing exceptional performance in our Platform business as customers continue to expand their usage. The dollar-based net retention rate for Platform was 135% in the third quarter. Our non-Platform customers software usage continues to be mature and relatively stable, with a net retention rate of 101% this quarter. Software sales were again strong this quarter, with annual contract value bookings of $19 million versus $11.6 million in the prior year, an increase of 64%. Our ACV bookings include only the annual recurring value of Software sales, excluding professional services. Turning now to our expenses for the quarter. Total operating expenses were $208 million this quarter, up slightly from our second quarter. We expect expenses to continue to increase modestly in our fourth quarter. Our non-GAAP operating margin, as shown on our Reg G schedule, was 49% for the quarter. We delivered non-GAAP margin expansion of 1,000 basis points over the same period last year. GAAP net income this quarter was $93 million, and our GAAP EPS was $3.61, which was down from last year when we had a $93 million pretax gain on sale of our collections and recovery product line. Our non-GAAP net income was $116 million for the quarter, up 17% from the same quarter last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 23%. We expect our FY 2022 recurring tax rate to be approximately 25% before any excess tax benefit and other discrete items. The resulting net effective tax rate is estimated to be about 24%. Free cash flow for the quarter was $115 million, up 16% from the same period last year. For the trailing 12-month period, free cash flow was $449 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $182 million in cash and investments. Our total debt at quarter end was $1.96 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of 3.86%. Turning to return of capital. We bought back 735,000 shares in the third quarter at an average price of $384 per share. At the end of June, we had about $119 million remaining on the current Board authorization and continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. With that, I’ll turn it back over to Will for his thoughts on the rest of FY ‘22.
Will Lansing: Thanks, Mike. As I said in my opening remarks, I’m pleased with our ability to continue to deliver strong results and how we can meet our customer needs while working in the best interest of our shareholders. We continue to deliver mission-critical software and analytics to customers. As the financial services industry continues to navigate the impacts of economic volatility, the need for precision through advanced analytics has never been more important. Lenders are seeking more ways to assess risk and opportunity in real-time to inform decision-making. And we have the technology and expertise to deliver best-in-class solutions. Our Scores business continues to provide lenders with time-tested analytics that help manage risk throughout the consumer lending market. And the use of those scores throughout the many different lending markets means we’re not highly leveraged to specific types of lending more customers. On the Software side, we continue to drive remarkable Platform ARR and NRR growth, demonstrating a strong market appreciation and appetite for our latest decisioning technology. Finally, as you know, it’s our practice to provide only annual guidance, so it’s not our policy to raise guidance in our fourth quarter. I’m pleased to say we are reiterating the full year guidance that we raised last quarter. We remain confident that we are well positioned to meet or beat the numbers we have presented and look forward to discussing our fiscal ‘23 expectations when we release our results next quarter. I’ll turn the call back to Steve for Q&A.
Steve Weber: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we’re now ready to take any questions you may have. Operator, please open the line.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
Manav Patnaik: Well, I just wanted to touch on the last point you made where you said you’re kind of prepared to meet or beat the guidance. But I was hoping you could just walk us through some of the moving pieces. It sounds like maybe mortgage could work, myFICO-dot could work. And anything else that perhaps either got worse or better, and maybe throw in some comments on pricing in there as well?
Will Lansing: Well, those -- I mean, pricing is really a discussion for next year. I mean the pricing is baked in for this year. And those really are the puts and takes. I mean we’ve got mortgage headwind, and everything else is pretty strong.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Kyle Peterson with Needham.
Kyle Peterson: I just wanted to have a question on Software. Results are really strong, especially on the ARR side this quarter for Platform. Have you guys seen any change, whether it’s in longer sales cycles or clients looking at potentially down-gauging deals with some recessionary fears kind of perking up here?
Will Lansing: No, no. We really have not. I would say that the IT spending in the financial services industry seems to be on track and hasn’t moved a whole lot. Sales cycles have not gotten any longer. They’re the same, which is not to say they’re short, but they’re what they have always been. And so I would say no change.
Kyle Peterson: Understood. That’s really helpful. And then, I guess, just following up on the expense run rate. You showed some really good margin leverage this quarter despite having your conference. Then you guys said expenses up modestly next quarter. What are the biggest drivers of higher expenses here? Is it just higher personnel and wage costs, just given the tight labor market? Or are there any other investments that you guys are making, that you guys want to call out right now?
Will Lansing: It’s a couple of things. We’re going back to a little bit more of the pre-COVID travel expense that has started -- is just starting to kick in again. And I would say that we are hiring. Attrition is more or less where it’s always been, but I think it’s taking us a little longer to backfill than in years past. It’s a tight market out there.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies.
Surinder Thind: A question about the ACV bookings here. It’s the third consecutive quarter of a really strong number. Any color or commentary there, in addition to what you’ve kind of said on the call, in the sense that I think the expectation is, is that relative to where expectations were, you guys are well ahead of that. And there also tends to be seasonality next quarter. So how should we think about that? Has there been any pull forward? Or should we just expect the normal seasonality as well?
Mike McLaughlin: So ACV bookings, as you know, is a new metric reported externally. We’ve been tracking it internally longer than that, of course. And we set high goals for ourselves for this year in terms of new sales, and we’re on track to hit those. There isn’t a material amount of pull-forward or any that I can put my finger on that’s happened this quarter or quarters before. ACV bookings is a pretty good metric because it doesn’t have the revenue acceleration dynamics or distortions that you see with other metrics. And we do expect Q4 to be good in terms of ACV bookings as it usually is.
Surinder Thind: Fair enough. And then in terms of the professional services, they had been declining for a while. I think, last quarter, you talked about them kind of bottoming. And then there was a meaningful uptick this quarter. I mean I realize it’s not a large number, but it’s -- that was a bigger uptick than I was anticipating. Any color there? Or what kind of drives the run rate there? Where should that kind of balance out?
Mike McLaughlin: Yes. I think it was my prediction, as you correctly point out, last quarter that we may have reached the bottom. I think that’s demonstrated early, so we have 1 quarter’s data point that, that is the case. When we shifted our strategic focus away from lower-margin professional services to focus more of our go-to-market energies on annual recurring software, we saw significant decline in the bookings of new professional services once we made that decision. It takes a while for those bookings to work their way through revenues because we, in any given quarter, have 3 or 4 quarters of backlog of professional services that we continue to work our way through. So we -- you can’t see it from the outside, but we saw our professional services new bookings go down pretty rapidly when we made the policy change. That decline in bookings stabilized about 4 -- 3 to 4 quarters ago, so the bookings are no longer declining. And it took a few quarters for the PS revenues to catch up and hit this, as you say, the new normal. So this kind of $25 million a quarter is probably a pretty good expectation in the near term.
Surinder Thind: Helpful. And then a question or a color on the B2C part of the business. You talked about continued double-digit growth at your partner, potentially seeing a slowdown in growth at myFICO.com. Any color there in terms of is it simply the net new additions number? Are you seeing a bit more, perhaps, turnover at myFICO.com? Any color you can provide there?
Will Lansing: No, it’s really the net new additions. I mean it has to do with the fact that we see spike in that business when people are out mortgage shopping. And so as mortgage volumes fall off, consumers subscribe to that in smaller numbers.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs.
George Tong: You provided revenue performance across mortgage, autos and card and personal loans. Can you describe how price and volume trends contributed to performance in those categories?
Mike McLaughlin: Price played a part. I think that if you look at the externally available numbers for performance in those 3 categories, that our volume realizations were similar to what you would think they would be if you looked at things like J.D. Power or the NBA or the results of the bureaus that reported in the last week or 1.5 weeks. I would say, as we said last quarter, that the mortgage decline in terms of units has been pretty consistent with what we expected it would be for the year when we set guidance and then revised it. Last quarter, autos have been a little worse than we expected, but our revised guidance bakes in that change. And then credit card and others is -- those volumes are doing really nicely as we expected. So we’re tracking the market pretty closely as best we can tell in terms of volumes.
George Tong: Got it. And then with respect to your Software business, the percentage of ARR that’s moving on Platform continues to tick higher. Can you lay out what internal goals you have for where you would like to see the mix of ARR on-Platform versus off-Platform over the next -- over the near to medium term?
Will Lansing: We don’t have a forced mix. We aggressively go after as much new Platform business and expansion Platform business as we can get. So that is a strategic priority for us. At the same time, we have so many customers who are involved with our legacy solutions and rely on us for that and renew those deals, that we continue to invest in features and functionality there. And I think, from our perspective, as long as that’s neutral to growing very modestly, we’re thrilled. And even if we were shrinking a little bit, it probably wouldn’t bother us very much. But we’re pretty happy with the mix the way it is, with dramatic growth on the Platform side and kind of flat growth on the legacy side.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird.
Jeff Meuler: On B2B Scores, what’s the typical lag from when the bureau gets the inquiry, to when it’s recognized by FICO as revenue? And the reason I asked is like it looks like you’re seeing some acceleration in card growth relative to last quarter. Your delta versus industry credit inquiries within mortgage was a little bit wider this quarter than it was last quarter. So I’m just trying to understand to what extent that’s a timing difference or if there’s some other factor that’s accounting for that.
Mike McLaughlin: Yes, Jeff, there really isn’t a timing difference with one caveat. The last month of the quarter, the data that we get from the bureaus, by the time we need to finalize it for closing the books, is tentative and subject to revision, I guess, I would say. And so we have to make some estimates and accruals based on judgment and lots of past experience as to what that will be. So occasionally, there will be a little bit of a true-up when we get the final data in there, but it’s not material and it’s not an explanation to the dynamic that you see in the data you just cited there. It’s real-time for June and with, as I say, with that asterisk.
Jeff Meuler: Okay. And then on myFICO, just so I understand it correctly, it’s still growing year-over-year, is that correct?
Mike McLaughlin: It’s more or less flat on a quarter-to-quarter basis, which means it’s still growing on a year-over-year basis. But if you look at the last couple of quarters, as Will mentioned, we’re seeing a lot less net new, probably because less people are shopping for mortgages. And that leads us to be cautious about the next couple of quarters at myFICO.
Jeff Meuler: Understood. Yes, the whole industry is seeing a much softer direct channel. I think if you’re up year-over-year and flat sequentially, you’re pretty significantly outperforming the industry’s direct channel. And then just on FICO World. Great to hear the registrations and that you’re doing it again in May of next year. How is the pipeline build? I would imagine that was a pretty significant pipeline building event for you itself, a little bit like a coming-out party for Platform. And you haven’t had it for a few years. So I would think that it’s actually a pretty big needle-mover relative to the last couple of years. If you could just talk about pipe build coming out of FICO World.
Will Lansing: Yes, that’s exactly right. So FICO World is several days of our showcasing our wares. But really, the heavy relationship building occurs in these consultation sessions where we sit down with clients individually and really were true, what we can do for them. And the pipeline that comes out of FICO World is phenomenal.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets.
John Mazzoni: This is John filling in for Ashish. Can you just talk about the slowing total Software ARR growth in the quarter?
Mike McLaughlin: Well, it’s slowed by a relatively small amount, and I would attribute that to normal quarter-to-quarter variability. And if you look at the 8-plus quarters that we revealed for that metric when we introduced it in November, you can see that, that kind of quarter-to-quarter variation is commonplace. So it’s not a reflection of anything fundamental, I wouldn’t say.
Operator: And all that does conclude the Q&A session for today. Mr. Weber, I’ll turn the call back to you. Please continue with your presentation or closing remarks.
Steve Weber: Thank you, and thank you to everyone for joining. We look forward to speaking with you again soon. This concludes today’s call. Thank you.
Operator: And all that will conclude the call for today. We thank you very much for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-04-27 17:00:00) =====
Operator: 00:07 Greetings, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Fair Isaac Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterward, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded, Wednesday, April 27, 2022. 00:29 And now, I'd like to turn the conference over to Steve Weber. Please go ahead.
Steven Weber: 00:34 Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining FICO's second-quarter earnings call. I'm Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations and I'm joined today by Will Lansing, our CEO and our CFO, Mike McLaughlin. Today, we issued a press release that describes our financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. 00:59 Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties, including the impact of COVID-19 on macroeconomic conditions and the company's business, operations and personnel that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular, the risk factors and forward-looking statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. 01:34 This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through April 27, 2023. 02:05 And now, I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
William Lansing: 02:08 Thanks, Steve and thanks to all of you who are joining us for our second quarter earnings call. On the Investor Relations section of our website, we posted some slides that offer financial highlights of our second quarter. I'm pleased to report that we continue to deliver strong results as we pursue our strategic initiatives in both Scores and Software. Today, I'll talk about this quarter's results and how we view our business at the midpoint of our fiscal year. 02:36 As you can see on page two of the presentation, we reported revenues of $357 million, which is an increase of 8% over the same period last year. We delivered $104 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $3.95 per share, up 52% and 70%, respectively. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $124 million, up 37% and earnings per share of $4.68 were up 53% from last year. 03:08 On the Scores side, the business continues to perform well. Scores were up 9% in the quarter versus the prior year as you can see on page six. On the B2B side, revenues were up 5%. As others have reported, we continue to see a slowdown in mortgage activity as interest rates rise. Mortgage origination revenues were down 23% versus last year. Mortgage revenues account for about 14% of our Scores revenues and 7% of our total company revenues. 03:43 Auto origination revenues were up 9%. Personal loan origination revenues were up 27%. While the mortgage declines have been significant, we do remain confident in our revenues given other areas of strength and pricing increases. Our B2C revenues continue to be strong, up 18% versus the prior-year quarter. We saw strong growth through both our own myFICO business and also through our channel partners. 04:13 In our Software segment, we delivered $173 million of revenue, up 7% from last year. We continue to drive growth in this segment, particularly on our platform. As you can see on page seven, total ARR was up 11% and the platform ARR grew 60%. We continue to deliver strong NRR as well demonstrating our existing customers eagerness to find new ways to expand their usage. 04:40 Total NRR for the quarter, which you can see on page eight, was 110%. Platform NRR was 141%, and we continue to sign more deals and bigger deals. Our ACV bookings, as seen on page nine, were up 55% over last year. I'll have some final comments including a revision of our guidance in a few minutes, but first, I'll turn the call over to Mike for further financial details.
Michael McLaughlin: 05:08 Thanks, Will, and good afternoon everyone. As Will said, we continue to drive strong growth throughout the business. Total revenue for the second quarter was $357 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year or 13% after adjusting for the divestiture of our Collections and Recovery product line last June. 05:25 In our Scores segment, revenues were a record $184 million, up 9% from the same period last year. B2B Scores revenue was up 5% over the prior year. As expected, mortgage origination revenues continued to decline, down 23% from the same quarter last year, but that was more than offset by growth in other areas. 05:46 Credit card and personal loan originations revenues were up 27% and auto originations revenues were up 9%. B2B non-originations revenues, which include FICO scores used for pre-screening, account management and insurance, were up 16%. B2C Scores revenues were up 18% from the same period last year. Both myFICO.com and partner B2C revenues grew significantly. 06:12 Software segment revenues in the first quarter were $173 million, up 7% versus the same period last year. Adjusting for the divestiture of our Collections and Recovery business, software revenues were up about 19%. Software license revenue recognized upfront or at a point in time as it is referred to on our 10-Q, was $27 million this quarter, compared to $12 million in the same period last year. 06:38 Our lower margin professional services revenues, which we are strategically deemphasizing were $24 million and down from $37 million in the same period last year. This quarter 78% of our total company revenues were derived from our Americas region. Our Asia-Pacific region generated 12% and the remaining 10% was from EMEA. 06:59 Our software ARR at the end of the second fiscal quarter of 2022 was $550 million, an 11% increase over the prior year quarter. Our platform ARR was $97 million, representing 18% of our total second quarter ARR and a growth rate of 60% versus the prior year. Our non-platform ARR was $453 million in the first quarter -- sorry, in the second quarter, up 4% from the prior year. A quick reminder, our reported ARR and related metrics exclude all revenue from divestitures in prior period. 07:35 Our dollar-based net retention rate in the quarter was 110% overall. We continue to drive very strong expansion from our platform customers as they expand their usage. The dollar based net retention rate for platform software was 141% in the second quarter. Our non-platform software usage continues to be mature and relatively stable, which is reflected in the non-platform net retention rate of 103% this quarter. Software sales were strong again this quarter with annual contract value bookings of $20.6 million versus $13.3 million in the prior year, an increase of 55%. As a reminder, ACV bookings include only the annually recurring value of software sales, excluding professional services. 08:20 Turning now to our expenses for the quarter, total operating expenses were $205 million this quarter, a decrease from $230 million in the same quarter last year. This year-over-year decrease is primarily due to the divestiture of our Collections and Recovery business, as well as various cost reduction initiatives. 08:38 Our non-GAAP operating margin, as shown on our Reg G schedule was 51% for the quarter. We delivered non-GAAP margin expansion of 1,200 basis points over the same period last year. GAAP net income this quarter was $104 million, up 52% from the prior year quarter. Our GAAP EPS was $3.95, up 75% or 70% from the prior year. 09:02 Our non-GAAP net income was $124 million for the quarter, up 37% from the same quarter last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 21%. We expect our FY 2022 recurring tax rate to be approximately 25% to 26% before any excess tax benefit or other discrete items. The resulting net effective tax rate is estimated to be about 24%. 09:28 Free cash flow for the quarter was $120 million versus $152 million in the same period last year. At the end of the quarter, we had $207 million in cash and marketable investments. Our total debt at quarter end was $1.81 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 3.70%. 09:47 Turning to return of capital, we bought back 580,000 shares in the second quarter at an average price of $455 per share. During the quarter, the prior Board repurchase authorization was exhausted and as previously communicated, a new $500 million authorization was approved. At the end of March, we had about $400 million remaining on that authorization and continue to do share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. 10:13 With that, I'll turn it back over to Will for his thoughts on the rest of FY 2022.
William Lansing: 10:17 Thank you, Mike. As I said in my opening remarks, we continue to deliver strong results, and I have confidence in our team as we move forward. Our Scores business continues to deliver strong growth, even in a volatile macro environment. As I've said in the past, our diversification through different credit verticals means that we're less dependent on specific types of lending, which is important in a rising rate environment. 10:41 On the software side, we continue to see more evidence that we're on the right strategic path. We've now delivered 10 straight quarters of platform ARR growth in excess of 40%. And we're excited to demonstrate to new and existing customers the best-in-class capabilities that can revolutionize the way they interact with consumers. As always, we remain focused on execution and are committed to delivering value to our shareholders and visibility to the progress we're making. 11:08 Finally, today, we're raising our full-year guidance as we enter the back half of our fiscal year. We are raising our full year revenue guidance to $1.355 billion. As we've noted, we're facing difficult comps in mortgage, but we're seeing strong growth in the unsecured lending markets and in most of our software markets. Some of these trends were anticipated, but there is clearly uncertainty as we move through the next half year.  11:35 We're also increasing our GAAP and non-GAAP net income as well as EPS. Our GAAP net income is now expected to be $350 million. GAAP earnings per share are now expected to be $13.11. Non-GAAP net income is now expected to be $429 million and non-GAAP EPS are now $16.08. 12:02 I'll now turn the call back to Steve and we will take the questions. Steve?
Steven Weber: 12:07 Thanks, Will. This does conclude our prepared remarks and we will now take your questions. Operator, please open up the line.
Operator: 12:14 Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Kyle Peterson with Needham. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Kyle Peterson: 12:40 Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to touch on your margins, really impressive this quarter. The expenses kind of come in leaner than expected. I know a lot of companies have been talking about inflation dynamics and cost pressures. How are you guys managing the cost? And is there anything kind of one time in terms of like timing of spending that we need to keep in mind as we progress through the year?
William Lansing: 13:11 Well, our expenses will be a bit higher in the second half than they were in the first half, but we're doing a pretty good job of managing expenses. Some things like travel and real estate are the kinds of things we expect coming out of COVID. They're still under control and less than they were in the old days. So there is that kind of cost control. 13:33 But I would say that we're also doing a pretty good job on the software side of bringing down our COGS and we're starting to see some benefits from our increasing focus on engineering our products and solutions for cost and efficiency and scaling. And so, all that's coming together and improving our margins.
Kyle Peterson: 14:00 That's helpful. And then I guess just a follow-up on the guidance raise on the topline, I know there's quite a few moving pieces, but just wanted to see if you guys could give any color on the dynamics between the pricing benefit and I’m also assuming it's some lower volume assumptions, at least on the mortgage side of things. So, just wondered if you could give some of the puts and takes of kind of the pricing versus volume and the net impact of those in your updated assumptions.
William Lansing: 14:38 It varies by the segment of Scores you're talking about, but there is definitely price benefit in there. Some volumes are down, some volumes are up, but prices offsetting the declines.
Kyle Peterson: 14:56 All right. Thanks, guys. Nice quarter.
William Lansing: 14:59 Thank you.
Operator: 15:00 Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Manav Patnaik: 15:06 Thank you. Good evening. Will, I just wanted to -- I was hoping you could expand on the comments you made on -- you have diversified lending categories. I know you said mortgage was 14% this quarter, I guess. Could you just help us with what auto, personal loans, et cetera is and perhaps what you're assuming in your guidance for those?
Michael McLaughlin: 15:31 Hey, Manav, it's Mike. Consistent with what we've shared in the past, the three segments of the originations, part of our B2B business, are roughly the same size. That varies from quarter to quarter, one grows or shrinks, but in approximate terms, that's the way to think about and we don't get into specifics beyond that.
Manav Patnaik: 15:56 Okay. And when you say same size, you mean 14%, which was mortgage would be the same as -- would be the same for cars and auto?
Michael McLaughlin: 16:07 In terms of dollars for B2B originations, that's correct.
Manav Patnaik: 16:12 Yeah. Okay, got it. And then perhaps -- obviously, there's a lot of uncertainties in the market et cetera. I was just hoping you could help us understand how your pricing strategy changes? Should we do -- enter a period of a slowdown?
William Lansing: 16:32 Well, we take it every year year-by-year and we're committed to consistently increasing our revenue and net income and EPS. We do what we have to do on price to make sure that that remains true. I think, you can expect that from us. It would take fairly calamitous change in the cycle for that to not be true. 16:57 But that's really what goes into figuring out how aggressively we move on price and you've also heard us talk about the pacing and the moderation in the way we go at pricing. We don't want to shock the system. And so it's that balancing act. I think that we put a very high value on consistency of growth. And so, I think you should expect that even as the cycle spins down a little bit, and we do what we have to do on pricing to make that happen.
Manav Patnaik: 17:36 Fair enough, thank you.
Operator: 17:41 Our next question is from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open.
George Tong: 17:46 Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. So just wanted to dive further into the special pricing increases, can you share what the customer receptivity has been so far this year, two price increases, and then as you look across the verticals, which vertical has seen more price increases than others? In the last year when mortgage volumes were very strong, price increases were not as high in the mortgage vertical. So are we seeing a reversal there? Just any additional commentary would be great there.
William Lansing: 18:21 George, you know, I talked about this in the past and you know, nobody loves price increases, okay. So, when you say what's the receptivity. I think customers will prefer not to have price increases than they have them, but I think that they expect reasonable and appropriate price increases from us and that's what we deliver and they've been well received. 18:41 We haven't had any significant deflection. We have no major customers leaving us. We have no threat to major customers leaving us. And so, I would say that we've been able to strike a pretty good balance between the price increases that led us consistently drive revenue and earnings without -- again without shocking the system. So, in short, I think, it's a conservative strategy and it's working well on the ecosystem.
George Tong: 19:12 And then the part on where you're seeing more or less price increases by vertical mortgage versus card versus autos?
William Lansing: 19:20 Well, so as I said in the past, we are increasingly trying to spread the price increases in ways that they are less visible to the customers and less visible to you. Our goal in a perfect world would be -- we could even point our fingers at where the price increase happened. 19:40 So there is a fairly elaborate exercise that we do internally to figure out where are the pockets of inelasticity where we can do price increases without losing volume. And so, we do that and we're getting better and better and better at that and that lets us do it in a way that's not nearly as visible and not as easy to describe. So I can't really give you a lot more detail there.
George Tong: 20:09 Got it. That's helpful. And then [Multiple Speakers]
William Lansing: 20:16 No, what's your next question, George?
George Tong: 20:19 I just wanted to get sort of your experience in working with the FHFA so far, whether you are in regular conversations with them? And where in the process you believe they are in terms of ultimately reaching a decision on mortgage source?
William Lansing: 20:39 No, I can't tell you when they will reach a decision. We're waiting for a decision like you all are. Pretty much what I can tell you is that, we continue to believe that we have the most predictive score. And so, we're proud of what we've submitted for evaluation. It's -- that's about where we are, we are waiting to hear the results.
George Tong: 21:08 Okay, got it. Thank you.
Operator: 21:12 We have question from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Ashish Sabadra: 21:18 Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could provide some more details around the large software license deal, whether that was a platform or enterprise deal? Any color will be helpful. Thanks.
Michael McLaughlin: 21:31 Hi. Ashish, it's Mike. It was mostly platform, not 100%. It's a multi-year deal and -- with what we think is a great customer.
Ashish Sabadra: 21:46 That's great. And I just wanted to follow up on an earlier question. Obviously, the mortgage has worsened compared to your prior guidance. The expectations there have come down, but I was just wondering how have expectations for cars and autos changed since the last guidance? Those seem to be holding up really well and the market there is pretty strong. I was just wondering how do those flow into the updated revenue guidance? Any color will be helpful. Thanks.
Michael McLaughlin: 22:19 You can see from -- Ashish, it's Mike again. You can see from the external data that auto sales for the first of our two fiscal quarters have been lower than what forecasts were when we set guidance originally. Supply chain being one of the primary reasons for it. And so, relative to the assumption we had for auto, credit originations that was embedded in our guidance last November, we have brought that down a bit to be in line with what best we can triangulate from external forecasts. We continue to be optimistic about credit card and other and personal loan originations, not much change frankly from what we thought was going to unfold when we set the guidance at the beginning of the year and mortgage continues to be negative.
Ashish Sabadra: 23:17 That's very helpful color. Thanks.
Operator: 23:22 And we have a question from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Jeffery Meuler: 23:27 Yeah, thanks. So we've had a couple of the bureau partners guide to the calendar year mortgage inquiries being down 30% to low 30%. Does your guidance assume something similar?
William Lansing: 23:42 It assumes something similar, yes. I mean, there's a little bit of a lag with us because we lag the bureaus, but we're affected by some of the same headwinds.
Jeffery Meuler: 23:54 Okay. I know you answered the question on expense management, but can you give us a similar take on the question but in the context of guidance just stands out, how much the adjusted net income guidance has increased relative to the magnitude of the revenue guidance increase? So if you could help us bridge that, that'd be helpful.
Michael McLaughlin: 24:18 So without getting into too much granular detail, I can give you the buckets that you can think about. First one is COVID related T&E, travel and entertainment, as well as big customer events. We've returned to normal there slower than we expected we would when we set guidance at the beginning of the year. 24:40 We still think that's going to increase in the second half of the year. We know it's going to increase because we have our FICO World event coming up next month and we also had our internal event, what we call Success, last month, actually it was in April, so it hit Q3. So we'll see increases there but relative to what we forecast the beginning of the year, we saw less in Q1 and Q2 and we think we'll continue to see less than we had thought we would in Q3, Q4. 25:11 The second bucket, Will mentioned it, is just reduction in the cost of delivering our SaaS products, COGS for SaaS, as well as other operational improvements that we've been able to achieve, mostly in the software business. We have line of sight on some of them, but we've frankly done a little better than we hoped and so we feel it's appropriate to reflect that in the guidance. 25:34 And then the third bit is, probably not a surprise if you cover other companies in the American economy that hiring is harder these days, just in terms of pace of being able to find people and get them on board. And so, we are hiring rapidly. We think we're getting good people, but it's just happening at a slower pace than we had assumed in the guidance. So, personnel costs are a little bit lower. Those are the three buckets.
Jeffery Meuler: 26:02 Got it. And then just maybe another comment on platform ARR and pipeline. I get that you had a monster sequential growth last quarter, so there is probably some pull forward into Q1, but just maybe if you could comment on the sequential growth or the pipeline, because I think that you said the mega win benefited platform and I would think that benefits platform ARR and it was fairly small sequential growth this quarter, if you could just talk through that. Thanks.
William Lansing: 26:38 Yeah, it's a fair question. The ARR for that large deal will not hit our reported ARR until next quarter. We have certain definitional rules about when a deal qualifies for ARR and others. We don't want deals that sign at 11:59 in the last day of quarter to boost ARR by millions and millions of dollars. It doesn't seem like it's a fair reflection. So we have a cut off period in ARR that's different than cut off period for ACV bookings or revenue, so you'll see that in the next quarter. 27:08 And also keep in mind that, our business, whether you think about it in ACV bookings terms or ARR terms, is lumpy from quarter to quarter. We did big deals and sometimes they hit in a quarter, sometimes they hit three, four days after the quarter. It was a good quarter, but in terms of the platform deals, we just happened to have a nice chunky one signed a few days ago for Q3. So don't fret too much about the quarter to quarter because of that and then specifically that big deal, it shows up in our revenue recognized at a point in time and ACV bookings disclosure did not hit ARR this quarter.
Jeffery Meuler: 27:47 Okay, thank you.
Operator: 27:53 And there are no further questions at this time.
William Lansing: 27:59 Thank you. Thank you everyone for joining today. That concludes our call and we look forward to talking with you again soon. Thank you for joining.
Operator: 28:08 That concludes the call. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-01-27 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Fair Isaac Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded Thursday, January 27, 2022. And I’d now like to turn the conference over to Steve Weber. Please go ahead.
Steven Weber: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining FICO’s first quarter earnings call. I’m Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I’m joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike McLaughlin. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties, including the impact of COVID-19 on macroeconomic conditions and the company’s business, operations and personnel that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company’s filings with the SEC, in particular, in the risk factors and forward-looking statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company’s earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations website at fico.com or on the SEC’s website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through January 27, 2023. And I’ll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
William Lansing: Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. In the Investor Relations section of our website, we posted some slides that we’ll be referencing during our presentation today. We delivered a strong start to our fiscal year with double digit growth in software ARR and Scores revenue and we continue to deliver strong earnings and free cash flow. Page 2 shows financial highlights from our first quarter. We reported revenues of $322 million in Q1 and $85 million of GAAP net income in the quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, Q1 net income was $102 million up 25% and earnings per share of $3.70 up 35% from the first prior year quarter. We continue to deliver strong free cash flow growth as well. Q1 free cash flow was $124 million, up 66% from the previous year. For the trailing 12-months free cash flow was $465 million. We’re off to a good start in our fiscal 2022 and we continue to be very focused on our strategy. In our software business, we continue to focus on the decisioning platform that enables businesses to optimize consumer interactions across their enterprise. When I started at FICO, we had a software business consisting of separate tools and endpoint applications. We evolved that business into a vision of an open and extensible platform uniting advanced analytics, decision modeling and AI. Historically, our software business has been separated by function, allowing us to deepen our expertise in various disciplines, optimize role based resourcing and drive process consistency. This month, we made an important change that better aligns our software organizational structure by integrating our entire software business under Stephanie Covert. Stephanie has led our sales, marketing and services organization where her strong leadership has effectively embraced strategic change, resulting in early wins and a growing pipeline of enterprise platform deals, prioritization of software IP, increased deal level of profitability and clear segmentation of direct and partner channels. I’m confident by placing all elements of our software business under Stephanie’s leadership, as we did years ago with this course business under Jim Wyman will see better alignment, faster and more effective decision making, improved resource allocation against top priorities and stronger end-to-end operational rigor and discipline. Last quarter, we made several important improvements to our external reporting to provide more visibility into the progress we’re making. Today, I’m happy to report that we continue to drive impressive growth in our software ARR as you can see, on pages 7 and 8 of the presentation. Total ARR was up 10% in Q1 and the platform ARR grid rate of 67%. Our net retention rate was also impressive. Total NRR was 109% and platform NRR was 143% and we continue to increase the value of the new deals that we’re signing. As you can see, on page 9 our ACV bookings were up 37% over the same period last year. We are excited about the depth of interest in our platform offering. This quarter we signed a deal with a major U.S. financial institution to use the platform. The multiyear deal is our biggest platform sale-to-date, and it enables the automation of much of the day-to-day customer decisioning using cloud based FICO analytics. In Scores, we’re continuing to innovate and to align our pricing with the value they provide. We had a very good quarter and our Scores segment with strong growth in both B2B and B2C. Scores were up 17% in the quarter versus the prior year as you can see on page 6. On the B2B side revenues were up 13% in the quarter versus the prior year. We continue to see a slowed down and mortgage origination volumes for the U.S. market were revenues were down about 17% year over year. But that’s more than offset by other areas in the U.S. where revenues growing rapidly. Auto origination revenues were up 27%, card and personal loan originations revenues were up 39%. The fiscal 2022 price increases we talked about last quarter take effect primarily in January and are not yet in our numbers. Our B2C revenues continue to be strong, up 27% versus the prior year quarter. We saw a strong growth through both our own myFICO.com platform and also through our partner channels. As always, we continue to be focused on shareholder value. Last quarter, I said we would continue to aggressively buyback our shares. I’m pleased to say we repurchased more than 1.2 million shares in our first quarter and more shares in January. Our buybacks reduced the outstanding shares by 9% versus Q1 of last year and this morning, we announced the new $500 million Board repurchase authorization. I’ll add some final comments in a few minutes. But first, let me turn the call over to Mike for more of financial detail.
Michael McLaughlin: Thanks William, and good afternoon, everyone. As Will said, we are off to a strong start to our fiscal year driving growth throughout our business. Total revenues for the first quarter was $322 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year or 9% after adjusting for the divestiture of our collections and recovery product line last year. In our Scores segment revenues were $169 million up 17% from the same period last year. B2C Scores revenues were up 13% over the prior year. As expected mortgage origination revenues continue to decline down 17% from the same quarter last year. But that was more than offset by growth in other areas. Credit card and personal loan originations revenues were up 39% and auto originations revenues were up 27%. B2C Scores revenues were up 27% from the same period last year, both myFICO.com and partner B2C revenues grew significantly. Software segment revenues in the first quarter were $153 million down 9% versus the same period last year. Adjusting for the divestiture of our collections and recovery business, software revenues were up about 1%. As we’ve discussed for several quarters, we continue to see reduced upfront licensed revenue recognition due to the change we made to our revenue recognition policy for on-prem software licensed subscriptions. And we are seeing reduced professional services revenues as we focus our sales efforts on higher margin software. On-prem software licensed revenue recognized upfront or at a point in time as it is referred to in our 10Q was just $7 million this quarter compared to about $13 million in our Q1 last year. Our professional services revenues were $27 million, down from $41 million in the same period last year. This quarter 82% of total company revenues were derived from our Americas region. Our EMEA region generated 12%, and the remaining 6% was from Asia-Pacific. Turning to the new software metrics that we introduced last quarter, our software ARR in the first fiscal quarter of 2022 was $547 million, a 10% increase over the prior year quarter. Our platform ARR was $92 million representing 17% of our total first quarter ARR and a growth rate of 67% versus the prior year. Our non-platform ARR was $455 million in the first quarter which was 3% higher than the prior year. Our dollar based net retention rate in the quarter was 109% overall. As we said, our non-platform customers’ software usage tends to be mature and relatively stable which is reflected in the non-platform net retention rate of 102% this quarter. On the other hand, our platform customers continued to show very strong net expansion from land and expand follow on sales and increased usage. The DBNRR, a dollar based net retention rate for platform was 143% in the first quarter. Software sales were strong this quarter with annual contract value bookings of $16.6 million versus $12.1 million in the prior year, an increase of 37%. As a reminder, ACV bookings include only the annual value of software sales excluding professional services. Turning now to our expenses for the quarter, total operating expenses were $207 million this quarter, a decrease from $225 million in the first quarter last year before accounting for the gain on sale from our ESS product and our JV in China. The year-over-year decrease is due to the divestiture of our collections recovery business, as well as various cost savings implemented in 2021. Our non-GAAP operating margin as shown on our Reg G schedule was 45% for the quarter. We delivered non-GAAP operating margin expansion of 900 basis points over the same period last year. GAAP net income this quarter was $85 million, down 2% from the prior year quarter due to a higher effective tax rate in 2022 as a result of lower excess tax benefit and the previously mentioned gain on sale last year. Our GAAP EPS was $3.13, up 5% from the prior year. Our non-GAAP net income was $102 million for the quarter, up 25% from the same quarter last year, and our non-GAAP EPS was $3.70, up 35% versus last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 19%, including $6 million of reduced tax expense from excess tax benefits recognized upon the settlement or exercise of employee stock awards. We expect our FY 2022 recurring tax rate to be approximately 25% to 26%. That expected recurring tax rate is before any excess tax benefit or other discrete items. The resulting net effective tax rate is estimated to be about 24%. Free cash flow for the quarter was $124 million up 66% from last year and for the trailing 12-months free cash flow was $465 million. At the end of the quarter we had $197 million in cash and marketable investments. Our total debt at quarter end was $1.65 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 3.74%. In December, we issued 550 million in senior notes as an add-on to the 350 million of notes we issued in 2019. We use the proceeds of the notes to reduce the draw on our revolving line of credit and to fund the share repurchases. Turning to return of capital, we bought back 1,244,000 shares in the first quarter at an average price of $397 per share. We repurchased nearly 400,000 additional shares in the month of January which exhausted our current Board authorization. As Will mentioned, we announced today a new $500 million repurchase authorization and continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. With that, I’ll turn it back over to Will for his thoughts on FY 22.
William Lansing: Thanks, Mike. As I said in my opening remarks, I’m extremely pleased with our Q1 results and the momentum we take into 2022. Our Scores business continues to deliver strong growth and our diversification through different credit verticals means we’re not dependent on specific types of lending. On the software side, we remain laser focused on our platform strategy and continue to drive strong results. We’ve delivered nine straight quarters of platform ARR growth in excess of 40%. We’re confident that we have the best-in-class capabilities in an emerging marketplace that’s poised for explosive growth. We remain focused on execution. We’re committed to delivering value to our shareholders and visibility to the progress we’re making. We will now turn it back to Steve for Q&A.
Steven Weber: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks. And we’re now ready to take any questions you may have. Operator, please open the lines.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We do have a question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. Good evening, guys. Well, maybe just I know you maintained your guidance, which is usually what you’d like to do. But, given the strong quarter just curious if you could just walk us through maybe some of the assumptions for the rest of the year that you’re looking at?
William Lansing: We’re not changing our guidance, Manav. I mean, we obviously hope that things improve over the year and we’re in a position to do better. But at this time, our guidance is our guidance.
Manav Patnaik: Maybe if you can get on, in terms of the volume assumption and that you gave us some of those origination numbers for the first time. So thank you for that. But just curious how we should think about how you’re thinking of how those trends?
William Lansing: In origination specifically or just generally I think first quarter is usually our hardest quarter. This quarter we exceeded our internal plan for first quarter. So that’s good news for us. It gives us a lot of optimism about the way the year is going to turn out. But I’m not ready to go out on a limb on volume forecasts.
Manav Patnaik: And then just lastly for me, you mentioned price increases usually start Jan 1st. It’s not in your numbers, but just curious if you could give us any color on if you did, put some of those out and then which areas?
William Lansing: As we discussed earlier, we have strategic pricing a kind of mixed across the board. It’s not in one particular spot. We did some tier based pricing. Some areas weren’t touched. Other areas were touched a little bit harder and as you know, it’s kind of a once a year event. So we did it and now we watch as it plays out. There’s not any revision to it going on.
Operator: Our next question is from Kyle Peterson with Needham. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Kyle Peterson: Good evening guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just want to touch on the platform ARR growth that looked really impressive this quarter. Was that a couple large deals that just kind of happened that kind of fallen into place for you guys or was it more broad based, just any color on the acceleration, it would be great?
William Lansing: It was a couple of large deals that fell into place, but they weren’t an accident. They were planned and I think it just underlines the fact that we’ve got the right kind of capability, the right kind of platform capability for big enterprise customers. It’s been proven out in the marketplace. We’re seeing the uptake. As you know, for us it’s a land and expand strategy where the platform gets installed and then the customer really focuses on all the incremental use cases that they can get with the platform in place. And so, we love landing the platform in large customers which is kind of what’s happened this quarter and which we anticipate will continue to occur over the year as we go forward.
Kyle Peterson: Great, that’s helpful, and then wondered if you could just touch a little bit on the professional services line. I know, it’s kind of expected to take a leg down sequentially this quarter and are we kind of at the point now where things are leveling off a little bit, and maybe to services kind of trends with kind of the non-platform side of the software business or are there any more near term kind of run offs that we should keep in mind relative to the 1Q run rate of like 26.5 million?
Mike McLaughlin: Hi it’s Mike. I think we are more or less at a run rate, if you want to put it that way. A big part of the decline was the divestiture of a collection recovery business as we disclosed in the 10Q, about $16.3 million of revenue that we had in the first quarter last year that we don’t have this year, about half of that was professional services. The rest of it is a combination of lower bookings. There was a little bit of push out of already contracted PS, which will catch up just schedule issue and milestone issues that are typical with any PS business, but the sort of 26 million a quarter 17%, 18%, 19% of revenue it feels consistent with what we’re the rate at which we’re selling new PS business going forward.
Operator: Our next question is from Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Surinder Thind: Good afternoon. My first question is about the land and expand strategy. Can you maybe provide a little bit more color in terms of how that actually works out into client? So when they buy the platform, do they tend to pour over existing functionality first, and then kind of build use cases or do they kind of reverse that which is they’ll keep existing functionality from existing products and then maybe build new functionality on the platform? Just trying to understand the way clients are paid.
Mike McLaughlin: It’s a bit of both and depends on the customer. So it’s not a typical for a customer to put the platform in with some fairly specific idea about the use, but is typically not as narrow as our legacy solutions. Typically, the customer will think through a half a dozen or a dozen uses for the platform at the get go and phase the introduction of those different solutions. And then, it’s not uncommon for the customer to figure out within 12 months, within 6 to 12 months that there’s a whole bunch more things they can do with the platform and so they immediately start planning the next phase. And so, what we’re seeing is that the idea of embedding the platform, providing the tools, really is the right strategy for getting incremental business from these customers and for them, it’s a great value proposition because they make the big initial investment. And then, incremental utility comes at very low cost having done so much of the data plumbing and so on. So that’s typical. Sometimes it’s to replace existing functionality. I would say that’s a lot of the time that in the initial that the land piece, but the incremental functionality comes very quickly.
Surinder Thind: That’s helpful. And then, turning to the B2C business, obviously, solid growth there in terms of the revenues, trying to break that down a little bit further, any color on typically this quarter generally has some $6 million to $7 million of licensing or at least it has the past couple of years. Was that also true this quarter as well in the B2B side of the business?
William Lansing: No, typically those licenses are in the fourth quarter. You can take that to the bank in any given year, but that’s what we’ve seen in the last couple of years. And so, Q1 for the last few years has not had a onetime event like that. So it’s a pretty clean quarter over or year-over-year comparison. 
Surinder Thind: And then, just maybe a question on, just color on the quarters volumes, auto revenues actually seem to accelerate or it showed stronger growth, but volumes were actually down quarter-over-quarter. So it was a little confounding or just people looking harder for auto vehicles at this point that’s pushing up overall increase volume or how should we think about that?
William Lansing: Surinder, when you say volumes are down, are you referring to some external?
Surinder Thind: I am referring to sales volumes. So obviously, your revenues were in auto pretty meaningfully, I think they were up 19% last quarter, and then 27% this quarter. But when you look at actual sales activity in terms of physical units of vehicles sold both the used market and the new market, those volumes are actually down pretty meaningfully. So kind of reconcile the difference?
William Lansing: So the data we track, we think there’s pretty good data out there about new card sales. Actual volumes for used card sales is pretty squishy as far as we’re concerned. So really don’t know whether they were up or down. But more or less, let’s call it a push in terms of volumes. Our volumes in terms of Scores and auto, we’re up a little bit. Remember our Scores revenue doesn’t require the card to sell it just require somebody to look for credit. So it’s possible that we could have more volume increase than the actual number cards sold. But if you think about the total revenue increase that was not volume. A little bit of volume contribution as I said, but it was the pricing actions that we’ve taken and how we feathered out through the tiers of the users of that Scores.
Surinder Thind: Got it, that’s helpful. And then one clarification on a comment that you made during the prepared remarks about the special price increases. And then I think there was a follow up question about it. I think you use the language that they’re primarily take effect in January, meaning that, is that something like you think kind of roughly 75% will hit this quarter and then maybe another 25 next quarter or is it just the vast majority kind of went into effect on January 1?
William Lansing: I mean, the vast majority, but we can’t control the timing because some of these things phase in later in the year, but I would say, yes, the majority is upfront.
Surinder Thind: Thank you. That’s it for me. 
William Lansing: 75% is probably a little too strong, but more than, a majority, more than half and less than 75%. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open. 
George Tong: Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to dive deeper into the Scores special pricing increase. As you did your tier based pricing for this year, how does that increase compare with the prior special pricing increases? Is it consistent? Did you step it up? Step it down? Especially in light of inflationary trends did you keep it consistent or did you step it up? And then how has customer receptivity been so far to these pricing increases?
William Lansing: I would say consistent with prior years. We didn’t take extra action in light of inflation and inflationary expectation. So, consistent would be the answer to that. And customer reaction is, as it’s always been, knowing those price increases, but they actually understand that the value that we provide, it makes sense what we charge for it. And so, very similar conversations to those we’ve had in the past with our customers which is they understand why we do it. Do they wish that we didn’t raise prices? Of course, they wish they didn’t. Of course, they wish that but they understand us.
George Tong: Got it, that’s helpful. And if you have to quantify on a blended basis, how much that step up is? Where would you place that number that’s consistent with prior years?
Mike McLaughlin: We don’t, we’ve never, I can tell you what you guys plug. But we’ve never provided guidance on the exact amount. It’s been on the order of $50 million I think in your models for years now.
George Tong: Great. And then with respect to the software business, can you discuss a little bit more about what’s changing with the appointment of Stephanie to the head of the group? How you plan to execute that and what the optimal outcome is of that restructuring in terms of leadership?
William Lansing: Yes. That’s a great question. And as you can imagine, we’re so focused on execution that we’ve spent a lot of time on this in recent months. Stephanie has been with us for many years. She’s an extremely effective leader. Everything that she’s had, she has just done a phenomenal job with sales and marketing and then we give professional services and she did a great job with that. And now we’ve tucked product and technology underneath her as well. And so she has the entire software business. I think that it will, as I said, it’s going to lead to more streamlined decision making. You could look at it as we have a little more of an SBU, a little more of a business orientation around that business, as opposed to being strictly functionally organized. It used to be the P&L didn’t really roll up until me. Now it rolls up to her. So there’s those benefits, but I think what we really have here is she’s just tremendous leader. And so we’re excited about her having the entire software business.
Operator: Our next question is from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Meuler: Yes, thanks. On platform software pipeline can you help us understand how it’s changing? And I guess, to lead in would be, are you starting to see a lot more large financials in developed markets in the pipeline? I feel like for a while we were hearing about like large lab based financial institutions and then this quarter, there was a call out on a large, U .S. based institution?
William Lansing: Yes. Look I wouldn’t read too much into what you hear in any one particular quarter. But I would say that we do have a very strong pipeline, software pipeline per platform with major financial institutions all around the globe, not just LATAM, not just North America. This quarter was strong for North America, obviously. But that’s where our direct sales force is putting its energy right now, it’s into our enterprise customers and into getting the platform put in place. And that’s what’s happening. We’re happy with it. But it doesn’t signal a shift. It’s just this quarter, it was North America and the quarters before LATAM was very strong and I expect to see that shifting around as we go forward. I mean, the pipeline is full of opportunities all over the world.
Jeffrey Meuler: And what’s the typical length of those contracts when you’re winning a client on the platform capabilities?
William Lansing: Typically around three years, but as you know, you put in the platform and we fully anticipate that the platform will be in for many, many more years, 10 years and beyond, but the typical contract would be three years. 
Jeffrey Meuler: Yes. And then last for me, what’s the company’s, I don’t know, steady state leverage target? How much would you go above that? Just obviously, leverage has come up a little but it’s still fairly low with the new repurchase authorizations driving the question. Thank you.
William Lansing: Well look, we’re as in love with our own stock as we’ve ever been. Can we continue to buy at the pace we’ve been buying? Probably not. We’re quite comfortable with our leverage where it is today, kind of mid twos. We could go higher. Our intent is to spend all of our free cash flow. We have been spending in excess of that. But our intent is always to spend at least our free cash flow. So there is certainly more dry powder, but I don’t think you could count on us buying at the same rate into the indefinite future.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We do have a question from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Ashish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to follow up on Manav’s question on guidance, which is focused on the EPS guidance. The prior guidance didn’t include buyback and you’ve done significant buyback just year-to-date. I was wondering how should we think about increasing the guidance for those? Is it fair for us to assume that you’ll increase guidance on the second quarter along with special pricing increases?
William Lansing: I think that if you want to adjust your numbers to reflect our aggressive stock buying recently, you can do that. That’s not a crazy thing to do. But we’re not providing different guidance.
Ashish Sabadra: That’s helpful color. And just given, just wondering if you had any color on the FHFA timeline, and any updated thoughts on that front ? Any color will be helpful. Thanks. 
William Lansing: Yes. So we’ve been following that process. We participate in the process exactly as laid out by law and by the regulators, by the agencies and by the FHFA. And so, we are awaiting the news, such as it is when it comes and they’re really, we don’t have anything else to share right now. We continue to be confident that we have very good product and highly predictive and so on, but I think we just have to wait and see what they do.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time.
William Lansing: Thank you. Thank you everyone for joining today and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. This concludes today’s call.
Operator: That concludes the call. We thank you for your participation and please disconnect your line.

===== 2021 Q4  (2021-11-10 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Fair Isaac Corporation quarterly earnings call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Wednesday, November 10, 2021. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Steve Weber. Please go ahead.
Steven Weber: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining FICO's fourth quarter earnings call. I'm Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike McLaughlin. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties, including the impact of COVID-19 on macroeconomic conditions and the company's business, operations and personnel, that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular, in the risk factors and forward-looking statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through November 10, 2022. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
William Lansing: Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. In the Investor Relations section of our website, we posted some slides that we'll be referencing during our presentation today. I'm pleased to report that our Q4 capped another terrific year, a year in which we posted record revenues, earnings and cash flows. And we were able to do this despite headwinds in fiscal '21 due to a shift in the timing of revenue recognition for term license subscription sales and the sale of 2 product lines in our software business and the managed and deliberate decline in our software and professional services revenues. Pages 2 and 3 show some financial highlights from our fourth quarter. We reported revenues of $335 million in Q4 and $1.32 billion of revenue for the fiscal year. We were able to grow our full year revenue despite these negative revenue factors. We delivered $86 million of GAAP net income in the quarter and GAAP earnings of $3 per share. For the full fiscal year, we delivered $392 million of GAAP net income and $13.40 of earnings per share, which includes the gain of $100 million on product line asset sales and business divestiture. On a non-GAAP basis, Q4 net income was $112 million, up 15%. And earnings per share of $3.92 was up 21% from the prior quarter -- prior year quarter. Full year non-GAAP net income was $383 million, up 31% over last year. And non-GAAP EPS of $13.07 was up 34% over the previous year. We continue to deliver strong free cash flow growth as well. Q4 free cash flow was $90 million, bringing the fiscal year total to $416 million, up 21% from the previous year. In fiscal 2021, we continued our commitment to shareholder return, buying back $882 million of stock during the year. We increased our leverage by about $425 million compared to year-end fiscal '20, but our adjusted leverage ratio remains a modest 2.07x. We view FICO shares as the best use of our excess cash at this time and expect to continue to aggressively buy back shares in the coming year. We had another solid year and making steady progress on our strategic initiatives. In our Scores segment, our diversification of verticals has enabled us to continue to drive growth even as various sectors slow down. Scores were up 10% in the quarter versus the prior year and up 24% for the full year, as you can see on Page 7 of the presentation. On the B2B side, revenues were up 2% in the quarter versus the prior year, which had a onetime royalty true-up. Adjusting for that, revenues were up about 15% for the quarter and 21% for the full year. As expected, we saw a slowdown in mortgage origination volumes, and revenues were down about 18% year-over-year. Auto origination revenues were up 19%, and card and personal loan origination revenues were up 45%. We are seeing particular strength in the card and personal loan space from our customers, including fintechs. The year-over-year pricing increases we implemented in fiscal '21 also had a positive impact on overall B2B revenues. Our B2C revenues were up 32% versus the prior year quarter and 42% for the full year compared to 2020. We saw strong growth through both our own myFICO.com products as well as through our partner channels. In next year's guidance, which I'll discuss in greater detail later, we expect the Scores business to grow about 6%. There's been no change in our strategy or approach to special pricing. Accordingly, special pricing increases consistent with the past several years are not included in this guidance. While we expect these price increases to have an impact consistent with those over the last several years, because it's difficult to estimate the timing and the magnitude of the impact, we remain conservative in how we issue our guidance relative to such increases. Turning to our Software business. As we have mentioned in recent quarters, we have been developing new financial metrics that provide more visibility into the recurring revenue generated by our subscription-based SaaS and on-prem software and the retention and growth of our existing software customers. Beginning this quarter, we are pleased to unveil our revised software reporting structure and these new metrics. Mike McLaughlin will go into much more detail in his remarks, but let me give you just a few highlights.  First, we reevaluated our operating segments to better align with how we assess performance and allocate resources. We merged our legacy Applications and Decision Management Software segments into a single Software segment. We continue to report the Scores segment, which is unchanged from past reporting. We also changed the classification of revenue from transactional and maintenance, professional services and license to on-premises and SaaS software, professional services and Scores to better align with our business strategy and peer reporting practices.  You'll also find in our 10-K this year our first reporting of annual recurring revenue, or ARR, which provides visibility into the growth trajectory of our Software business without the variability that comes with the upfront revenue recognition required by ASC 606 for on-prem subscription sales. We are also disclosing dollar-based net retention rate and annual contract value of software bookings. Another big change we'll be talking about is the split of our Software revenue between our on-platform and off-platform products. We'll give those splits for revenue, for ARR and for dollar-based net retention revenue. We believe it's important to focus on the progress of our on-platform offerings as it's the central strategy of our Software business. As in prior years, we will continue to focus on investing in our software platform. In fiscal '21, we divested assets that could not be easily migrated to the platform and reallocated resources to accelerate platform development and our go-to-market efforts. By allocating the resources strategically and efficiently, we expect to spur growth and achieve scale while effectively managing our operating expenses. I'm happy with the progress we made in 2021, and I'm optimistic about what lies ahead in 2022 and beyond. We'll continue to allocate our resources to areas of high strategic importance, and we'll continue to focus on long-term shareholder value.  I'll have some final comments in a moment, provide our fiscal '22 guidance then. But first, let me just turn the call over to Mike for further financial details.
Michael McLaughlin: Thanks, Will. And good afternoon, everyone. As you may have already seen in our 10-K and the financial highlights presentation posted to the FICO website, we have made significant enhancements to our financial reporting this quarter, including the introduction of new metrics in both our Scores and Software segments. We'll briefly preview these metrics, and I will take some extra time on this call to provide more details on what we are disclosing and what new insights these numbers provide. As Will said, we have a strong finish to our fiscal year, and we are well positioned as we enter fiscal 2022. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $335 million, a decrease of 11% over the prior year due primarily to a reduction in upfront recognition of term license revenues on-prem software sales, the sale of our Collections and Recovery product line in June and lower professional services revenue in our Software segment. Our full year revenue of $1.32 billion was up 2% over last year. In our Scores segment, revenues were $169 million, up 10% from the same period last year. B2B revenue was up 2% over the prior year. As you may recall, last year's fiscal fourth quarter included a onetime royalty true-up that did not recur this year. Adjusting for this onetime true-up, B2B revenue was up about 15% this quarter. B2C revenues were up 32% from the same period last year. Both myFICO.com and partner revenues grew significantly. One of the new financial metrics we are adding to our 10-K and 10-Q disclosures going forward is the breakdown of our Scores segment revenues between B2B and B2C components. For the full year, Scores revenues were $654 million, up 24% from last year. As Will previewed, we have merged our Applications and Decision Management segments into a new Software segment. Software segment revenues in the fourth quarter were $166 million, down 25% versus the same period last year. Full year Software revenues were $662 million, down 14% from the previous year. This quarterly and full year decline was due to reduced upfront license revenue recognition, reduced professional services revenue and the divestitures of our Collection Recovery products. I will spend a few minutes discussing each of these 3 factors and their impact on FY '21 results. At the start of fiscal 2021, we shifted the timing of revenue recognition for on-premise term license subscription deals. As a result, we now recognize less upfront license revenue and more revenue ratably over the term of each contract. The net impact was lower license revenue in our Software segment of about $12 million in Q4 and about $34 million for the full year versus what it would have been under our prior sales model. To help show the impact of upfront revenue recognition of on-prem term license software sales, we have added a new table in the 10-K that breaks out our on-premise and SaaS software revenue into revenue recognized at a point in time versus revenue recognized over the contract term. Turning to professional services. We have previously explained how we are deemphasizing low-margin nonstrategic services engagement. As expected, this has resulted in lower PS revenues. Our PS revenues were down 35% in Q4 compared to the prior year quarter and 20% for the full year. Professional services continued to be an important part of our business, helping our customers implement our software and realize the most value from it over time. We expect to see additional modest declines in our services revenues over the next few quarters, after which we expect it to return to a growth trajectory in line with our on-premise and SaaS revenues. The third factor negatively impacting reported revenues this period was the divestiture of the Collections and Recovery product line in June as well as the sale earlier in the year of our Enterprise Security Score and the sale of certain assets to a joint venture we established in China. To help understand the impact of these divestitures, we have added additional details to the financial highlights presentation posted on our Investor Relations website. In that presentation, you will find reconciliations of our revenue in prior periods excluding these divestitures. This quarter, 81% of our total company revenues were derived from our Americas region. Our EMEA region generated 14%, and the remaining 5% was from Asia Pacific. The Americas region, which we will use in our financials going forward, is simply a combination of our North America and Latin America regions. We mentioned in our call last quarter that we are planning -- that we were planning to introduce a number of new financial metrics for our Software segment. We are pleased to introduce those metrics this quarter. You will find a full description of these new metrics in the 10-K and on Page 8 of our financial highlights presentation. Let me take a few minutes to briefly walk you through each new metric. The first of these is annual recurring revenue, or ARR, which measures the underlying performance of our subscription-based software contracts. ARR is defined as the annualized revenue run rate of on-premise and SaaS software agreements within a quarterly reporting period. And as such, it is different from the timing and amount of revenue recognized in any given period. All components of our software licensing and subscription arrangements that are not expected to recur, primarily perpetual licenses, are excluded. We calculate ARR as the quarterly recurring revenue run rate multiplied by 4. Second new metric is annual contract value, or ACV, bookings. This replaces our previously disclosed bookings metric, which was based on total contract value, including the value of professional services. ACV bookings is the average annualized value of software contracts signed in the current reporting period that generate current and future on-premise and SaaS software revenue. We only include contracts with an initial term of at least 24 months, and we exclude perpetual licenses and other revenues that are nonrecurring in nature. We also exclude the value of professional services sales. For renewals of existing software subscription contracts, we count only incremental annual revenue expected over the current contract as ACV bookings. The third new metric is dollar-based net retention rate, or DBNRR, a measure of our success in retaining and growing revenue from our existing customers. To calculate dollar-based net retention rate for any period, we compare the ARR at the end of the prior comparable period, we call it the base ARR, to the ARR from that same cohort of customers at the end of the current quarter, retained ARR. Then we divide the retained ARR by the base ARR to arrive at the dollar-based net retention rate. Our calculation includes the positive impact among this cohort of customers of selling additional products, price increases and increases in usage fees and the negative impact of customer attrition, price decreases and decreases in usage-based fees during the period. It is important to note that our disclosed ARR, dollar-based net retention rate and ACV bookings numbers for the current quarter and all prior quarters exclude revenues and bookings from our divested assets to make period-to-period comparisons more meaningful. Fourth, as mentioned briefly above, we are disclosing the amount of our Software segment revenue that is recognized at a point in time versus recognized over the contract term. This helps provide an understanding of a key factor that drives the differences between reported Software revenue and ARR from period to period. And finally, we are breaking out our on-premise and SaaS software revenues, ARR and dollar-based net retention rate into platform and non-platform components. The shift of our software solutions and capabilities to the FICO platform is our #1 strategic goal in the Software segment. This new disclosure provides significant additional visibility into our progress. Taken together, we believe these metrics significantly enhance investor visibility into our Software segment. Specifically, ARR and dollar-based net retention rate show how we are retaining and growing our subscription-based customer relationships. And our platform disclosure shows the size, growth and expansion potential of the FICO platform. Now let me give you a few highlights on what these new metrics show this quarter. Our Software ARR in the fourth quarter was $524 million, a 7% increase over the prior year. Our platform ARR was $75 million, representing 14% of our total fourth quarter ARR and a growth rate of 58% versus the prior year. Our non-platform ARR was $449 million in the fourth quarter, which was 1% higher than the prior year. Our dollar-based net retention rate in the quarter was 106% overall, while our non-platform customers' software usage tends to be mature and relatively stable with retention hovering around 100%. Our platform customers are showing very strong net expansion from land-and-expand follow-on sales and increased usage. The dollar-based net retention rate for platform was 143% in the fourth quarter, up from 116% in the prior year. Excluding divested product lines and businesses, our software ACV bookings for the quarter were $25.8 million versus $28.9 million in the prior year. ACV bookings increased for the full year to $62.8 million versus $58.3 million in FY '20, representing growth of about 8% year-over-year. As a reminder, ACV bookings include only the annual value of software sales, excluding professional services. Turning now to our expenses for the quarter. Total operating expenses were $219 million this quarter. This included an $8 million restructuring charge primarily associated with reductions in our professional services delivery staff and rationalization of resources following our Collections and Recovery divestiture. Our non-GAAP operating margin, as shown on our Reg G schedule, was 45% for the quarter and 40% for the full year. We delivered non-GAAP margin expansion of 600 basis points for the full year. GAAP net income this quarter was $86 million, up 45% from the prior year quarter. Our non-GAAP net income was $112 million for the quarter, up 15% from the same quarter last year. For the full year, GAAP net income was $392 million, which included a gain of $100 million on product line asset sales and business divestiture. Non-GAAP net income was $383 million, up 31% from the prior year. The effective tax rate for the full year was 17%, including $24 million of reduced tax expense from excess tax benefits recognized upon the settlement or exercise of employee stock awards. We expect our FY 2021 recurring tax rate to be approximately 25% to 26%. That expected recurring tax rate is before any excess tax benefit and other discrete items. The resulting net effective tax rate is estimated to be about 24% for the year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $90 million. For the full year, free cash flow was $416 million, up 21% from last year's $343 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $195 million in cash on the balance sheet. Our total debt at quarter end was $1.26 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 3.3%. In October, we amended our credit agreement to allow for the issuance of a $300 million term loan with our bank group, increasing our total bank capacity to $900 million. We used the proceeds of the term loan to reduce the draw on our revolving line of credit. Turning to return of capital. We bought back 845,000 shares in the fourth quarter at an average price of $446 per share. In fiscal 2021, we repurchased a total of 1,877,000 shares at an average price of $470 per share for a total of $882 million. At the end of September, we had about $173 million remaining on the Board repurchase authorization and continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. With that, I'll turn it back over to Will for his thoughts on fiscal '22.
William Lansing: Thanks, Mike. As we move into fiscal '22, I believe we are well positioned for the year ahead. In our Software business, we continue to solidify and add functional capabilities to our platform. And we remain committed to becoming the preeminent provider of decisioning analytics. We are committed to pursuing growth opportunities and improving our efficiency. In our Scores business, we continue to innovate and find new ways to add value for our customers and benefit from the diversification that comes from the broad usage through the various credit verticals.  We entered the new year with more visibility than last year, and as such, are again providing guidance for fiscal '22, as shown on Page 15 of the presentation. We are guiding revenues of about $1.35 billion, an increase of about 3% versus fiscal '21 on an as-reported basis and about 6% when adjusted for the divestitures. We are guiding GAAP net income of approximately $318 million, GAAP earnings per share of approximately $11.29, non-GAAP net income of $397 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $14.12. I'll turn the call back over to Steve, and then we'll take your questions.
Steven Weber: Thanks, Will. This prepares our prepared -- this concludes our prepared remarks, and we're ready now take your questions. Operator, please open the lines.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.
George Tong: You're guiding to Scores revenue growth up 6% next year. That excludes any special pricing increases. Could you talk about what the assumptions are and factors are that go into your 6% growth outlook?
William Lansing: It's a continuation. We break it down into the pieces. And we look at mortgage. We look at auto. We look at card. We look at prescreen. So we look at all the pieces and put estimates on that. We use industry forecasts to inform those estimates, although we're not always exactly on top, we form our own views. And that's basically how we do it. That's how we got to the 6%. I mean it's a combination of -- it combines both volume increases based on industry and price increases as well.
George Tong: Okay. Got it. So there is some measure of underlying pricing increase in there?
William Lansing: Yes. Just to be clear, it's CPI kinds of increases.
Michael McLaughlin: Not including the strategic price increases.
William Lansing: Right.
Michael McLaughlin: And George, I would add to that. I just -- sorry to interrupt, just looking across those segments, we do our best to predict volumes for the 3 major parts of our B2B business. Just like you probably do. We don't have a crystal ball. But I can say that our expectations for mortgage are in line with what you would find from third-party forecasters. And likewise, we expect modest but positive growth in the auto and credit card and other segments.
George Tong: Okay. Yes. That's helpful. That was the extra color I was hoping to get. And then with the extra Software disclosures, I guess if we dive into ARR performance, the percentage of ARR that's on platforms at 14%, it's nearly double what it was about 2 years ago. What are your expectations for how that continues to tick higher? What's embedded in your 2022 guide? And how would you expect that trajectory to just perform in the years ahead?
William Lansing: We see the platform side of ARR growing at over 50%.
Michael McLaughlin: And overall, if you just do the math on our guidance, the 6% total revenue growth is approximately equal in terms of percentage between the Software and Scores business. So if you expect very strong continued growth in the platform business, we think our platform is going to be relatively flat.
George Tong: Okay. So 50% is a good run rate growth to apply to the platform piece.
Michael McLaughlin: That's right.
Operator: Our next question comes from Surinder Thind with Jefferies.
Surinder Thind: As a follow-up to the ARR question and more specifically the net revenue retention rate of 143% for the platform, can you talk about the sales process and how that works for the client in terms of what the client initially buys and kind of what the upsell is and how the timing of the upsell works?
William Lansing: Sure. And obviously, it varies from client to client. Typically, we put the platform in with a specific number of use cases and very specific ideas about how the platform will be used and what problem is being solved. But increasingly, it's being put in with a view to being able to provide additional solutions later on. And what we're seeing -- a classic land-and-expand strategy. And what we're seeing is that's working with our current platform customers and what -- and the ones that have gone in less recently, we're seeing expansion. We're seeing new uses, new ways of using the platform, and so -- which is what's really informing that 143% retention rate.
Surinder Thind: That's helpful. And then in terms of just bringing on new clients onto the platform, can you talk a little bit about the conversations you're having there and what it's kind of taking to get them across the finish line and the time lines generally involved?
William Lansing: The time line is a little bit longer than our historic 270-day sales cycle with our older applications. But the -- what's happening is it's a bigger deal at the client. It's being brought in as part of a broader strategy. It's being brought in with a view to using it to really interact with consumer customers strategically. And so it is a bigger, more complicated conversation, but it's -- we're kind of in the middle of it. We're right in the middle of the way our clients want to interact with our consumer customers. We're seeing ourselves pop up in their strategy presentations.
Surinder Thind: Got it. And just kind of a technical question on the accounting part of the ARR maybe. Is there a kind of a volume component to it in the sense that there's a head count of the number of people that are on there, all else equal, or usage?
Michael McLaughlin: I'm not following the head count part of it. Are you talking about our contracts that are usage-based as opposed to based on minimums per year?
Surinder Thind: Yes, the combination of minimums versus usage base. So let's say a use case has -- a lender has, I don't know, 10 million accounts or something like that as a use case or was part of that. And then obviously, that number can change. So are there kind of bands? Or how does that work? Just to understand what the volatility might be.
Michael McLaughlin: Yes, it's a good question. So our contracts have both. Many have minimums. Many have usage components. Some have minimum with usage if you exceed a certain amount of volume or use cases or accounts. What we do is if it's minimums, that's what goes in the ARR unless and until that customer exceeds the minimums, and then that additional run rate is added to ARR in the period in which that occurs.  If it's a purely usage-based contract, some of our customer communication services contracts, for example, are based on the number of messages that are sent in cases where fraud is identified or what have you. There, we estimate once the solution has been installed and is running and has shown a stabilized usage rate, we then use that as the ARR that we will enter into the quarter's results. If that usage goes up or down in future quarters, we adjust ARR accordingly. Does that make sense?
Surinder Thind: Yes. That's actually very helpful. That's it for me.
Operator: Next question comes from Kyle Peterson with Needham.
Kyle Peterson: Just wanted to touch on the margins. Obviously, it came in really strong this quarter. I know there's been a lot of moving pieces with deemphasizing professional services and the C&R divestiture. But just wanted to get any thoughts on what your assumptions would be on like the sustainability of operating margins in line with what we saw this quarter.
Michael McLaughlin: There isn't anything structural that has changed or we expect to change in the quarters ahead in fiscal '22 versus what you've seen in recent quarters other than the fact that we expect to return to traveling. So if you look at the expense breakdown in our supplemental materials, I think we spent $0.5 million on T&E in Q4. That's going to go back up to a more normal rate, or at least that's what we're projecting.  Professional services, as that declines, that's a low gross margin business, therefore, a high cost of goods sold business. So the cost of goods sold declines as those revenues go down. But otherwise, in terms of what we're investing in R&D and go-to-market and G&A, nothing dramatic has changed in our forecast versus our historical other than we've taken out a lot of expense from divestitures.
Kyle Peterson: Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess just a follow-up on the B2C side. The performance continues to be really impressive for Scores. Is this something that you guys think you can keep growing kind of above trend? It seems like you guys are putting up significantly faster growth than what we're seeing with some of the other players in the space.
William Lansing: I think that there's a lot of strength in the FICO brand, and I think that there's a lot of strength in the operating and management acumen of our B2C team. So doing better than others, I think you could expect that. Will we be able to repeat year-over-year performance in the 30s? I can't promise that. I think we're more likely to be on something closer to our quarter-to-quarter growth.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. The next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets.
John Mazzoni: This is John Mazzoni filling in for Ashish. Maybe just a quick one on the B2B revenues. I know there was a onetime impact that if adjusted, that would be around 15%. How should we think about these moving forward, especially going into kind of the '22?
William Lansing: Those kinds of onetimers happen periodically. It is kind of part of the business. We do audits and true-ups every few years with different channel partners. And so can you expect them to continue? Yes, there will be things like that, that are a little bit unpredictable. But it is part of the business.
John Mazzoni: Understood. And then maybe just a quick follow-up. How do you see the Software business evolving over time? Maybe of a longer-term perspective, just as we kind of wrap our heads around these new metrics, what could be a longer-term growth rate or any type of things that investors should be paying attention to?
William Lansing: Okay. With the caveat that this is not guidance, I would say look at our platform growth, 50% platform growth, which tells you that we have something there that the market wants. We have a large number -- a large number -- 19 enterprise customers, large customers who have adopted the platform and many more in the pipeline. And what we're seeing is that's a combination of conversion, substitution of platform solutions for more historical solutions, but it's also growth. It's also new stuff.  And so over time -- and it could be a very long time. But over time, you'll see our software transition from our older solutions to platform solutions and the platform solutions piece is growing a lot faster. So will our growth rate go up? Yes, it almost certainly will go up as we do more and more of our total Software business on the platform. So if today is 6%, I would just extrapolate out from 6% upward. And I don't know how many years it will take, but we will be in double digits eventually.
Operator: And Mr. Weber, there are no further questions.
Steven Weber: All right. Thank you all for joining today's call, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. This concludes the call.
Operator: And that will conclude the conference call for today. We thank you very much for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-08-03 17:00:00) =====
Company Representatives: Will Lansing - Chief Executive Officer Mike McLaughlin - Chief Financial Officer Steve Weber - Vice President, Investor Relations
Operator: Greetings! And welcome to the Fair Isaac Corporate Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded today, Tuesday, August 3, 2021. I’d now like to turn the call over to Steve Weber. Please go ahead.
Steve Weber: Thank you. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining today’s FICO’s third quarter earnings call. I am Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I am joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike McLaughlin. Today we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties, including the impact of COVID-19 on macroeconomic conditions and the company’s business, operations and personnel that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company’s filings with the SEC, in particular in the risk factors and forward-looking statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company’s earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company’s website at FICO.com or on the SEC’s website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through August 3, 2022. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
Will Lansing : Thanks Steve, and thank you everyone for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. Before I discuss our results, I'd like to thank our FICO colleagues for their dedication, adaptability, and innovation during this past year. As we begin to open our offices back up, we're moving to a hybrid system where more of our team is working from home, but we've proven in the past year that we can make the most of technology to collaborate and continue to serve our customers and optimize our business, both remotely and in person.  On the Investor Relations section of our website we posted some slides that offer financial highlights of our third quarter.  In our third quarter we delivered revenues of $338 million an increase of 8% over the same period last year. As previously disclosed, we completed the divestiture of our debt collections and recovery products during the quarter. Adjusting for that, revenue grew about 9% year-over-year.  We delivered $151 million dollars of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $5.18 per share, including the gain on sale of the C&R products. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the sale, net income was $99 million, up 29% and earnings per share of $3.38 was up 31% from last year.  We continue to deliver very strong free cash flow growth as well. Free cash flow was $99 million in the quarter and $462 million for the last four quarters, and we're dedicated to using that cash flow return value to our shareholders, through our repurchase program. It was a very strong quarter for us, and we are well positioned for a strong finish to our fiscal year.  As we continue our strategy of migrating our business model towards a subscription based model, we see some disruption in our near term numbers. We're not recognizing as much revenue upfront and not selling and delivering as much lower margin services revenue. So, these efforts are positioning the company for long term predictable and profitable growth.  Beginning next quarter we will be providing additional metrics that will give additional transparency to our business. Metrics like ARR will complement our revenue reporting and provide a better indicator of our growth trajectory. We'll also be talking about the different delivery vehicles for our software, specifically whether the products are delivered on platform or off platform.  The Decision Management platform is the linchpin to our software strategic vision and bringing new customers onto that platform will enable us to scale the business and realize its full potential. As I've stated, we believe we can become the pre-eminent player in decisioning analytics; that is our singular role in our software business.  On the Score side we remain committed to innovation while maintaining the predictability that has always been the cornerstone of the FICO score, and I'm pleased to report that we continue to drive outstanding growth in our Score’s business. Score’s posted another record quarter, up 31% versus the prior year.  On the B2B side revenues were up 23%. Mortgage originations as predicted in the marketplace appear to have peaked and were flat with last year's numbers. It is now a year since the refi boom began and we expect those numbers to trend down as the market returns to more normal levels.  Auto originations continue to be strong with those revenues up more than 30% year-over-year. The most dramatic growth came from credit cards and other unsecured lending products. We had a record revenue quarter in card originations, with revenues up more than 50% from last year. We saw acceleration in card origination activity throughout the quarter and expect that activity to continue to be strong.  Fee screen volumes were up more than 150% versus last year. This is typically a leading indicator for new card origination activity, and shows the financial institutions have a strong appetite to market and originate new accounts in the unsecured market. We believe banks are in a very strong financial position to pivot to other lending products as mortgage demand wins as expected by the industry.  On the consumer side we continue to drive impressive growth. Our B2C revenues were up 50% versus the same quarter last year. That growth at myfico.com while still strong is slowing, which we expected as the mortgage market cools off. Growth among our partners has picked up as Experian and others find new ways to serve an increasingly sophisticated consumer.  Finally, this quarter we closed the divestiture of our collections and recovery product line. Mike will review the financial impacts and talk about how we are using the proceeds for share repurchases. As we said last quarter, the divestiture further focuses our resources on refining and distributing the best-in-class decision platform that we believe is an incredible opportunity for FICO.  I’ll have some final comments in a few minutes, but first, I'll turn the call over to Mike for further financial details. 
Mike McLaughlin : Thanks Will and good afternoon, everyone. Today I'll walk you through our third quarter results in more detail and provide some information on divestiture of the collections and recovery products we closed in quarter.  Total FICO revenue for the quarter was $338 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year. Our applications segment revenues were $133 million up 3% sequentially and down 6% versus the same period last year.  Adjusting for the C&R divestiture, applications revenues were up 6% versus last quarter and down 4% from last year. The year-over-year decrease in revenue was primarily driven by reduced professional services revenues.  In our decision management software segment, Q3 revenues were $33 million, down 20% over the same period last year, due primarily to decreased upfront license revenues. As Will said, our shifting business model is continuing to impact our software business in the near term. Our on premise license revenues will continue to decline as we move away from license sales to a notable subscription revenue model.  Second, at the start of our fiscal year we noted that we have also changed our revenue recognition assumptions for on premise term license subscription deal. As a result, we now recognize less upfront license revenue and more revenue ratably over the term at each deal. The net impact this quarter was lower license revenue in our applications and DMS segments, of about $4 million versus what it would have been under our prior methodology. We anticipate the full year impact will be about $40 million and lower software license revenue this year, all of which will be recognized in future periods.  As a reminder, last year we booked $61 million in upfront license revenue and our fiscal fourth quarter under the prior methodology. So that will be an especially difficult year-over-year comparison.  As we pointed out in the past, this change in timing does not have an impact on free cash flows or the total revenue recognized from software license sales over the term of each subscription contract. I'd also like to remind you that we are deemphasizing low margin, non-strategic professional services engagements, which is resulting in lower PS bookings and revenue. This is driven by our core strategic goal of selling more high value software with decline revenue. This quarter services revenues were down 18% versus last year.  As Will said, we closed the divestiture of our collections and recovery product line in the third quarter. We recognized a pre-tax book gain of $93 million in the third quarter. The sale contributed $2.52 of after tax EPS to the quarter's GAAP results. Proceeds from the sale were used to fund a previously announced accelerated share repurchase program.  Turning to our Scores segment, total revenues were $172 million up 31% from the same period last year. B2B was up 23% over the same period last year, driven by continued high volumes in credit card and auto originations, as well as some unit price increases across our different score categories. B2C scores revenues were up 50% from the same period line year, both myfico.com and B2C partner revenues grew significantly. This quarter 80% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region, our EMEA region generated 14% and the remaining 6% was from the Asia Pacific region.  Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter represented 85% of total revenues. Consulting and implementation services revenues were 11% of total revenues and license revenues were 4% of total revenue. SaaS software revenues, not including related PS revenues continued to grow and were $67 million for the quarter, up 10% from the previous year.  Q3 bookings totaled $75 million, down 29% from the previous year and had an average weighted term of 30 months. Those bookings generated $9 million of current period revenues, a 12% yield. Much of the decline in bookings was due to our de-emphasize of low margin professional services, and the shorter term lengths of deals signed. Professional Services bookings totaled 21% down 50% from last year.  We continued to see a strong pipeline in our software business, and typically we have our strongest period for new deals in our fiscal fourth quarter. As we have said, we expect bookings to trend lower overall compared to historical numbers as a result of our de-emphasis of professional service sales and the somewhat shorter term length of typical subscription and on-prem term license contracts.  As Will mentioned, we plan to begin providing more subscription software financial metrics next quarter, and we believe that the additional transparency will lead to better understanding of the results of the company, particularly in the software segment.  Our operating expenses totaled $144 million dollars this quarter, which included the $93 million dollars gain on the C&R sale, compared to $230 million in the prior quarter. Excluding that one-time gain, expenses were up $7 million, primarily due to increased incentive compensation expense. Compared to Q3 2020, operating expenses, excluding the one-time gain were up $6 million. We do expect to continue to increase in Q4 as we gradually add strategic headcount to drive our decision management platform development and distribution and increase customer related travel.  Our non-GAAP operating margin as shown on our Reg G schedule was 39% for the quarter, a margin expansion of 500 basis points from the same period last year. GAAP net income this quarter was $151 million, which included $93 million of pre-tax gain from the divestiture. Our non GAAP net income was $99 million for the quarter, up 29% from the same quarter last year.  The effective tax rate for the quarter was 20%. We expect our FY 2021 recurring tax rate to be approximately 26% to 27 % and we expect the net effective tax rate for the year to be about 19%, including the impact of the divestiture of our collections and recovery business.  Free cash flow for the quarter was $99 million flat with the same period last year. For the trailing four quarter's, free cash flow was $462 million. At the end of the quarter we had $238 million in cash, up $40 million from last quarter. Our total debt now stands at just over $1 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 3.64%. Turning to return of capital, we bought back 489,000 shares in the third quarter at an average price of $466 per share. This includes a $200 million accelerated share repurchase agreement we entered into following the close of the C&R divestiture. For the nine months ended June 30, 2021 we repurchased 1.31 million shares. At the end of June we had about $225 million remaining on our stock repurchase authorization and we continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of our cash.  With that, I'll turn it back over to Will for his closing thoughts. 
Will Lansing: Thanks Mike. As I said in my opening remarks, I'm extremely pleased with our team's ability to manage our business and serve our customers in the midst of all this uncertainty created by the pandemic. We continue to prove that the FICO business model was strong. Our customers rely on our Mission Critical software, scores and other analytics to manage risk and optimize interactions with consumers. We continue to invest and innovate to provide state art solutions for customers looking use analytics to make better decisions.  I'll turn the call back over to Steve now for Q&A. 
Steve Weber: Thanks Will. This does conclude our prepared remarks. Operator, if you'd like to open the lines, we are now ready to take your questions. 
Operator: Certainly and thank you very much. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Surinder Thind: Thank you. I’d like to start with the question about just the adoption of a competitor score by a large car issuer that's recently revealed I guess. Can you talk a little bit about the competitive marketplace at this point in terms of just how you think about the FICO 10 suites and maybe kind of if there's anything unique that prompted the issuer to switch from using FICO. 
Will Lansing: Yeah, the short answer is, without getting into all kinds of details, that was a special situation I think. That score has been around for a long time and our score is very strong and continue to stand the tests in the marketplace of being desirable. We believe our scores are the most predictive out there for what they are used for. And our business in Scores is as strong as it has ever been; our volumes are very strong. We have not seen a decline, and we don't see major issuers switching away. So I guess the best way to characterize that is a one-off and I think that's really it.
Surinder Thind: That's helpful. And then in terms of just, when I think about the Scores business broadly and especially the strength that we're seeing in B2C, is there any additional color that you can provide in terms of the framework for how we should be thinking about the growth of that business. It is seeing if we were to rewind to last year, I think the thesis was that you know there’s a lot of people that were concerned with their credit scores and so there's a kind of a rush to kind of do credit monitoring on a personal basis.  But now that the pandemic has resided [ph] I guess it – we're further through that process. Can you talk about the resiliency of that business and maybe are there additional factors that are now driving the growth? When I think about it on a sequential basis, the growth was still very impressive. 
Will Lansing: Yes, I think that there's some offsetting trends here, so the one trend that we worry about – we don't worry about it, but we recognize is that mortgage was super high over this last year and we can't expect it to continue at the same levels, and that's what all of our market analysts predict and we don't see any reason to disagree with that. And it is true that when consumers go shopping for mortgage, they often go to credit score monitoring to get a sense for what they are able to get by way of mortgage and pricing. So that's a positive factor that won't be as present going forward, at least until the next cycle.  Offsetting that I think is a level of awareness on the consumer part of the importance of credit scores, which has just been on a steady upward trajectory for a very long time, certainly the last five years. And as I've shared with you in the past, you know 10 years ago the FICO score aided awareness was about 30% in the U.S. and today its over 90% and most consumers are well aware of how important the FICO score is and continue to try to monitor it. So we see that as a positive and a positive that will continue.  And then finally our partners who provide credit report monitoring, credit score monitoring services are increasingly sophisticated in the way they get the message out and what they provide to their consumer customers, and they are doing very well and we encourage that. So, we feel pretty good about the business. 
Surinder Thind: That's helpful. And then maybe one other quick one. It sounds like auto and credit card volumes were an important contributor to the B2B part of the growth story. Can you talk about maybe where we might be in terms of how close are we to pre-pandemic levels within like the credit card segment at this point? I feel like there's a good visibility into auto volumes, mortgage volumes, which is kind of the third leg of that story. 
Will Lansing: Mike, I don't know if you have any detail on that that we can share. 
Mike McLaughlin: Yes, we need to be careful about that because of the nature of our relationships with the bureaus of course, but it feels as though there's definitely still room to grow. They have rebounded smartly and we can see that in our results, but we're not in the business of predicting credit card volumes as you can understand, but what we can see looking backwards, which is all we can do, is it’s still growing and doesn't appear to be plateauing. 
Surinder Thind: That’s helpful, thank you. I'll get back in the queue. Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Kyle Peterson with Needham. Your line is open. 
Unidentified Analyst: Hey! Good afternoon. This is actually [Inaudible] for Kyle today. I was wondering if you guys could provide a little more color around the pricing environment for the Score business. Did that last round of pricing changes have any noticeable impact on the Scores business this quarter? Thanks. 
Will Lansing: Yes, I would say not dramatic differences, not dramatic changes, not dramatic impacts from that. 
Unidentified Analyst: Got it, that's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up, how should we think about the expense and margin trajectory of the business moving forward after that recent divestiture there? 
Will Lansing: I wouldn't expect tremendous changes. I mean there's some benefit that comes from de-emphasizing lower margin professional services as we talked about, so there's a benefit there, but at the same time, you've heard us talk about the opportunity in the platform space and the tremendous amount of R&D that we're pouring into it. And so I think there's focus on cost and expense control on the one hand, but at the same time our investment levels are high. So I think those offset one another and I wouldn't look for tremendous margin improvement.  There's also and this is a much more modest effect, but there's also coming out of COVID there'll be more travel expense, that sort of thing. 
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, got it. Alright, thanks guys. 
Operator: Your next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. 
George Tong: Hi! Thanks. Good afternoon. Going back to the Scores business, revenue grew 31% in the quarter and you mentioned mortgages were relatively flat from a volume perspective, parts and autos strong. Can you at a high level discuss how much part and auto volumes grew by and how much pricing contributed to growth? 
Will Lansing: Well, I don't think we break that. That’s something we’ve kept to ourselves. Mike, you want to help me with that? 
Mike McLaughlin: Yeah, well sure. There were some numbers in the script which we can revisit with you on the one-on-ones if you like. But as Will said in his previous answer, the story this quarter was about volumes on price. It's not that there was no impact of price, but it was the lion's share for sure about volume in the segments we’ve discussed. 
George Tong: Okay, Got it. And then I'd like to dive a little bit more into your on platform strategy. Can you talk about evidence that you're seeing increasing customer adoption of your on-platform solutions and what initiatives you have to further drive client adoption of your on platform products? 
Will Lansing: Yes, absolutely! So all of our major – if you think about our major franchises, customer management, [inaudible] the triad franchise which goes to line increases and judgments about how and what to do with customers, existing customers and our other franchises that we are increasingly putting those solutions on top of the platform, so we're selling our software in a couple of ways.  One is, where the customer is after a solution and they happen to get that solution on top of the platform or they will, but they are still accurate particular solution. But increasingly what we're seeing is major financial institutions saying, we want to standardize on the platform, and we want to do not two or three or four solutions. We have an intent to do 10 or 15 or 20 solutions on top of this platform.  We want to leverage all of our data across all the different places where it resides and apply analytics and do it in a unified way, so we leverage everything that we have to make decisions with respect to customers and that's very much the future of our – that’s our platform strategy and that's our future as doing that.  We have – it's a lumpy business. So we've landed a number of big customers over the last 12 months for the platform for this very purpose with an intent to start with five or 10 or 15 use cases and then expand beyond that. So we're pretty happy that the solution is meeting the need in the marketplace. The platform strategy has legs and it seems to be working.  That said, we have a lot of work left to do. Not all of our solutions are completely reported to the platform and the platform isn't as modular as we wish it were, we're working on that. So there's definitely plenty of investments still going in. But from a customer reception standpoint, we have medium and large financial institutions who have adopted it. 
George Tong: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. 
Ashish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering if it's possible to quantify how we should think about the impact from the C&R divestiture in the fourth quarter or a quarterly impact going forward? 
Will Lansing: Mike, you want to take that? 
Mike McLaughlin: I can take that one. Yes, I'm happy to. We mentioned last quarter or perhaps it was in the press release when we announced the deal, that roughly it's 6% of our revenues and that's you know rounding to the nearest percentage. And expense are in the near term that we'll be able to flex in the same ballpark as those revenue numbers.  It's a Q4 heavy business just like our other software businesses are. So the year-over-year impact of not owning that business in Q4 in ’21 would have some seasonality associated with it versus a [inaudible] respect, but what will give you a ball park of what to expect. 
Ashish Sabadra: Okay. And then maybe just to follow-up on the earlier question around the software, I was wondering if you could talk about like the progress on the API, the external API strategy, as well as the studios. Any color there will be helpful? Thanks. 
Will Lansing: Yes, I would say both of those proceed to pace, and that we have – am I hearing this interference.  We are making progress on both the external facing APIs and on FICO Studio, there’s more of that to come, but much of that will be ready this year. 
Ashish Sabadra: That's very helpful. Thanks. 
Operator: The next question comes from Caroline Conway with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. 
Caroline Conway: Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the expectations for applications going forward following the recent divestiture. Would you say that the business at this point is right sized, and can you talk about the strategic role of the business unit at this stage, particularly as it relates to the decision management business? 
Will Lansing: Yes, I guess I would say that it is right sized. We don't have any plans for any significant divestiture going forward, at least not at this time. So I would call it right sized. I think the way to think about it is that the application solutions will increasingly be available on top of the decision management platforms and you so [inaudible] bear with you how those things break out. But you know right sized, yes. 
Caroline Conway: Okay, thank you. And my other question is next quarter as your talking about the ARR and other metrics, are you expecting to provide additional detail on decision management profitability, especially the timing of turning to a profitable level? And will we see some guidance at that point as well on growth rates? 
Will Lansing: Will started with the revenue and I think we'll have the TBD on getting down to margin level. 
Caroline Conway: Okay, thank you. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Next question comes from Jeff Mueler with Baird. Your line is open. 
Jeff Mueler: Yeah, thank you. Anything further you can say on bookings, it was the third quarter in a row of relatively weak bookings, and it sounds like the de-emphasis of professional services is a large part of that.  You also mentioned shorter term length, and I guess is that customers electing shorter terms or you and customers jointly preferring shorter terms because of how the subscription based software is sold or is that timing of large deal activity? Just how much of the weaker bookings is that? How much of it is other things? 
Will Lansing: The shorter term length is significant. It's – Mike can keep me honest, I think it’s on the order of 25% reduction in term length, so it's significant. In terms of whose idea is that, we always do what the customer wants.  That said, if we had – to the extent that we have a choice in the matter, our preferences were shorter, because we do think that's a better way to go. We think that there are more opportunities for us to revisit things sooner if we go for the shorter term length.  So, and this is part of why we changed the way we compensate our sales force as well. We used to compensate on bookings and longer terms to commissions and we no longer do that. Our goal is to provide the term that our customer wants, but shorter is absolutely fine with us. 
Mike McLaughlin: And Jeff, I can add a little bit of color to that. So the term length, the average term length was 37 months a year ago and it was 30 this time; that's about a 20% decrease, 19% to be specific. And if you apply the rough math, that's $15 million to $20 million of bookings right there, just because of term length. And the other factor is PS intensity. Our PS bookings were $20 million lower this quarter than they were last quarter. You see we are $30 million down in total bookings. So those two factors alone would, you know all else being equal explain that. 
Jeff Mueler: Helpful. And then when you're giving the example of customers landing on the platform with a eventual intent to do 10 or 20 solutions, how many skews are there? Like how many solutions could a customer buy today if they bought everything or like where is that going? 
Will Lansing: Well, it's probably skews is not even the right way to think about it. Because when we think about skews we are, I don't know, call it 150 skews. But the platform in its modular form provides the opportunity to do hundreds and potentially thousands of combinations of things. And so I think, I think what we are moving to is more of a usage based pricing and a modular pricing that lets customers mix and match the components that they want, to achieve the goals that they want from a solution standpoint and so it's not like everything will be pre-packaged. 
Jeff Mueler: Okay. And then last one for me, just on B2B scores, how do you maintain an ongoing dialogue with the ultimate end market enterprise customers. So, I think technically, it's your customer's customer because your Q and K disclosure is revenue concentration based on the bureau relationships. So how do you maintain that end-market dialogue and I guess monitor their commitment to staying on FICO scores. 
Will Lansing: Obviously, we stayed close to it through our channel partners, the bureaus. But we also certainly for all of the major institutions, we have direct sales relationships, and so any significant activity in one direction or another is well understood by our people and we are in a dialogue with them. 
Jeff Mueler: Got it. Thank you. 
Operator: And there are no further questions at present time. I’ll turn the presentation back to you. Please continue with your presentation or closing remarks. Thank you. 
Will Lansing : Thank you. Thank you everyone for joining. This concludes today's call. We look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thanks for joining. 
Operator: And that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you very much for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-05-05 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings. And welcome to the Fair Isaac Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Wednesday May 5, 2021. I would now like to turn the conference over to Steve Weber, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead.
Steve Weber: Thank you. Good afternoon. And thank you for joining FICO’s second quarter earnings call. I am Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I am joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike McLaughlin. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve many uncertainties, including the impact of COVID-19 on macroeconomic conditions and the company’s business, operations and personnel that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company’s filings with the SEC, in particular in the risk factors and forward-looking statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company’s earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company’s website at fico.com or on the SEC’s website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through May 5, 2022. And now, I will turn the call over to Will Lansing.
Will Lansing: Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. I'd like to start by saying that I hope you are all safe and healthy. And I want to thank our dedicated FICO employees who have done an exceptional job meeting the challenges in the last year and never wavering in their commitment to FICO or their colleagues and our customers. We've tremendous team, a great culture at FICO and I'm really honored to report that FICO was ranked number one on Forbes' annual list of America's best midsize employers. On the investor relations section of our website we posted some slides that offer financial highlights of our second quarter. Today, I'll talk about this quarter's results and how we do our business at the midpoint of our fiscal year. And I'll discuss how we continue to refine our strategy to optimize our Scores asset and sharpen our focus on our world-class decision management platform. We reported revenues of $331 million, an increase of 8% over the same period last year. We delivered $69 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $2.33 per share, up 18% and 20%, respectively. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $90 million, up 40%, and earnings per share of $3.06 was up 42%. from last year. We continue to deliver very strong free cash flow growth as well. Second quarter free cash flow was a record $152 million, up 178% from last year. I'm pleased to report that we continue to execute well against our strategic initiatives throughout the company. As we've said, for the last several quarters, we're continuing to migrate more of our business toward a subscription based model, including SaaS software subscriptions, and tern license subscriptions for on-prem software. This strategic decision will provide a more representative view of the growth trajectory of our business. But it also gives us some difficult comparisons for last year, when we had significant upfront license revenues. In our application segment, we delivered $130 million of revenue, down 8% from last year due to a 29% decline in upfront license revenues, and a 21% decline in professional services revenues. In our decision management segment, we delivered $33 million of revenue, up versus our Q1, but down 14% due to reduced upfront licenses and lower services revenue. Transactional revenues and DMS were up 34%, and as we continue to transition more of our software business to a recurring SaaS model. We continue to have a lot of interest in this technology and our pipeline contains more big deals as we continue to gain traction in the space. We remain committed to becoming the preeminent platform player in decisioning analytics and we're focusing our resources to make that vision a reality. On the Score side, the business continues to perform very well. Scores were up 31% in the quarter versus the prior year. On the B2B side, revenues were up 25%. There was continued strength in mortgage originations, which grew substantially year-over-year and also sequentially. We'll see more difficult comps in the back half of our year as it's now been a year since the refi boom began. Auto origination volumes were fairly flat, but revenues were up versus the previous year. We're continuing to see positive signs in cards and other unsecured loan activity. Volumes were still down from last year, but were higher than Q1. The price increases we instituted are starting to have an impact, giving us revenue increases in pockets where volumes are weaker. On the consumer side, we continue to drive impressive growth. Our B2C revenues were up 47% versus the same quarter last year. The growth of myfico.com is particularly remarkable, up 82% this quarter versus last year. The continued strong demand is a testament to the quality of our offering and an understanding by consumers that FICO, the Scores that lenders use. Finally, as you know today, we announced the divestiture of our collections and recovery product line. Michael provides some financial details in a few minutes. But I'd like to explain the strategic rationale behind this move. We're extremely focused on our strategic vision to enhance expand and distribute the FICO decision management platform. We believe we have an incredible opportunity to be a best-in-class leader in the next wave of business analytic technology. In order to fulfill our potential, we need to make choices to be able to allocate all the resources we can to the platform strategy. The FICO collections and recovery products help customers make important decisions throughout the lifecycle of collections and recovery. These products deliver excellent functionality and serve an important customer need. But the complexity of the underlying architecture makes it impractical to migrate to our platform, coupled with the need for high-touch professional services, engagements and customization, it doesn't fit within our strategic framework. So as we did with our ESS divestiture, and as we do with our China joint venture, we've chosen to sharpen our focus and align our resources on our decision platform. I would like to thank the team that built and delivered an industry leading set of products and solutions that have helped our clients, enhance their collections and recovery efficiency, effectiveness and compliance. I want to assure the collections and recovery customers at FICO and Jonas Software are committed to serving our clients without disruption during this transition period. We're confident that Jonas Software will continue to invest in these solutions and support our clients and colleagues with the same commitment and partnership they've come to expect. I'll have some final comments in a few minutes. The first I'll turn the call over to Mike for further financial details.
Mike McLaughlin: Thanks Will, and good afternoon, everyone. Today I'll walk you through our second quarter results in more detail and provide some information on the impact of the divestiture of the collection and recovery products that we announced today. Revenue for the quarter was $331 million and increase of 8% over the prior year. Our applications revenues were $130 million, down 8% versus the same period last year. The quarterly decrease in revenue was primarily driven by a decrease in upfront on-prem license revenue and professional services revenue. In our decision management software segment, Q2 revenues were $33 million, down 14% over the same period last year. We had an increase of 34% in SaaS subscription revenue in the DMS segment, but that was offset by decreases in upfront on-prem license and services rep. Now, before turning to our Scores segment, I would like to remind you the key moving parts that are impacting our application and our DMS segment revenues. First, our on-premise license revenues will continue to be negatively impacted as we move away from perpetual license sales to a ratable subscription revenue model. Second, we have changed our revenue recognition assumptions for on-premise license subscription sales. As a result, we now recognize less licensed revenue upfront, and we recognize more revenue ratably over the term of the deal. The net impact this quarter was lower license revenue on our applications and DMS segment, of about $6 million, versus what it would have been under our prior methodology. We anticipate the full year impact will be between $45 million to $50 million, lower software license revenue this year, all of which will be recognized in future periods. We expect them especially difficult year-over-year license comparison in our fourth fiscal quarter, where last year we booked more than $60 million in upfront license revenue under the prior methodology. As we pointed out in the past, this change in timing will not have an impact on pre-cash flows or the total revenue recognized from software license sales over the term of each subscription contract. Finally, as we explained last quarter, we are de emphasizing low margin non-strategic professional services engagement, which is resulting in lower PS bookings and revenues. This is driven by our core strategic goal of selling more high value recurring revenue software. Professional Services are a very important component of our business model, providing installation and configuration services for our software, and advisory and consulting expertise that enables our customer to leverage the power of cutting edge analytics in their business. These parts of our professional services business are here to stay. The reductions you are seeing in our services business are the result of our strategic decision to focus our energies on these value added services. Now turning to our Score segment. Revenues were $169 million, up 31% from the same period last year. B2B was up 25% over the same period last year, driven by continued high volumes and mortgage originations, as well as some unit price increases across our different Score categories. In the B2B business, we also had a royalty true-up and an annual license deal this quarter that had a small positive impact on overall revenues. B2C scores revenues were up 47% from the same period last year, both myfico.com and B2C partner revenues grew significantly. This quarter 79% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region, or EMEA region generated 15% and the remaining 6% was from Asia Pacific. Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter represented 85% of total revenues. consulting and implementation services revenues were 11% of total revenues, and license revenues were 4% of total revenue. SaaS software revenues, not including related PS revenues were $62 million for the quarter, up 8.8% from the prior year. Q2 bookings totaled $84 million, flat with the previous year, those bookings generated $9 million of current period revenues a 10% heal. SaaS bookings including the associated professional services were $25 million for the quarter, down 19% from the previous year. Professional services bookings of $22 million were down 35% from last year. However, overall software bookings excluding professional services bookings were up 5% year over year. We continue to see a strong pipeline for our software products and we feel good about the bookings outlook for the full fiscal year. But again, we do expect bookings to trend lower overall compared to historical numbers as a result of our de emphasis of professional services sales, and somewhat shorter term lack of typical SaaS and on-prem term license contracts. As a side note, we remain committed to providing our shareholders with more of the common metrics that subscription software companies typically provide in order to give investors a better understanding of our software business. We continue to work to extract and validate the necessary data and we hope to be able to provide it sometime this fiscal year.  Our operating expenses totaled $230 million this quarter, compared to $218 million in the prior quarter, which included a $7 million gain on sale of product line assets. Excluding that one time gain expenses were a 5 million, primarily due to increased incentives expense. Compared to Q2, 2020. operating expenses were down $2 million. We do expect expenses to step up somewhat in the back half of the year as we gradually redeploy the restructuring savings we incurred last year to add strategic headcount primarily related to the development of our decision management platform software. We also expect our travel entertainment expense to increase once we were able to resume in person meetings with our customers and colleagues. Our non GAAP operating margin as shown in our Reg G schedule was 39% for the quarter, a margin expansion of 700 basis points from the same period last year. GAAP net income this quarter was $69 million, up 18% from the prior year quarter. Our non GAAP net income was $90 million for the quarter, up 40% from the same quarter last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 25%. We expect our FY, 2021 recurring tax rate to be approximately 26% to 27%. And we expect the net effective tax rate for the year to be about 19%. That's prior to the impact of the divestiture of our collection and recovery business. We do expect to book a taxable gain on the sale, and we will provide more details on that next quarter. Free cash flow for the quarter was $152 million compared to $55 million in the same period last year, an increase of 178%. For the trailing four quarters free cash flow was $461 million. At the end of the quarter we had $198 million in cash, up $53 million from last quarter. Our total debt now stands at $975 million with a weighted average interest rate of 3.9%. Turning to return to capital. We bought back 441,000 shares in the second quarter at an average price of $466 per share. During the quarter, the board -- the prior board repurchase authorization was exhausted and a new $500 million authorization was approved. At the end of March, we had about $470 million remaining on that authorization and continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. Finally, I'll walk through the expected impact of the divestiture of our collection and recovery products. As Will said, we made the decision to divest these assets to increase our focus on our decision management platform. The collection and recovery products we sold accounted for less than 10% of total company revenues. Because they often involve significant PF engagement, as much as half of total revenues. They had a much lower margin profile than our platform products. There will be some noise in the next few quarters as we work through the transition. But we expect that this divestiture will not have a significant impact on our pre tax income. We expect to close the deal sometime in our third fiscal quarter. And the sales proceeds will contribute to the funding of a $200 million accelerated share repurchase program that we plan to execute once the transaction closes. With that, I'll turn it back over to Will for his closing thoughts.
Will Lansing: Thank you Mike. As I said in my opening remarks, we remain focused on our strategy and committed to taking our decision management platform to growing number of interested customers. At the same time, we are innovating and providing a cornerstone value in Scores in both B2B and B2C. Finally, as you know, we haven't provided guidance for this fiscal year, we still see a lot of volatility, as we see the global economy begin to open back up. We have tremendous confidence in our business model that are far more focused on providing long term value than hitting specific numbers for the next few quarters. It's those values that drive us to favor ratable subscription revenue over upfront license revenue. So for now, we're not providing any formal guidance until we see how the credit markets stabilize and we understand the full year impact of our recognition of license revenues. Now, I'll turn the call back to Steve, so that we can do some Q&A.
Steve Weber: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks and we are now ready to take your questions. Operator, please open the lines.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey. This is actually Greg on for Manav. I think the divestitures you've made so far make a lot of sense when you explain them. Just wondering if there's any smaller products left out there that could be candidates for similar treatment? Or from here, it's more about being selective in the contract going forward?
Will Lansing: I would say that this is pretty much the end of the reprioritization of our resources. So we don't see any significant divestitures in our immediate future.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And historically, M&A hasn't been a big part of the story. As you go through this process of reprioritization and thinking about capital allocation, is there potential for M&A to be a bigger part of the story going forward?
Will Lansing: I'd say that the potential in the future is about the same as the potential in the past, it's always been there. And we've always had trouble finding anything that we find as attractive as investing in ourselves. Our current plan is to deploy all of the proceeds from this transaction in stock repurchase.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And maybe last one for me. Just on the sales pipeline for the software business, I think you said, you're pretty bullish about what you're seeing. Any color by geography as we see different fits and starts and reopening by geography. If there's any areas that you're seeing more traction. Any color, that would be helpful? Thanks.
Will Lansing: I'd say that South America is strong. But we're seeing signs of the economy waking up kind of across the board. Mike, I don't know if you want to add anything to that.
Mike McLaughlin: I guess what I would add is the nature of our sales on the software side are lumpy and long sales cycle for the most part. And so, month-to-month, even quarter-to-quarter changes in the ability of our customers to have people in the office, to meet face-to-face due to the pandemic and other things, it doesn't necessarily show up with the same frequency to might for a company that had, a shorter sales cycle and more higher frequency, lower ticket sales. So, the pipeline that we see in the major regions we serve looks healthy, all things considered in all regions. And I wouldn't be able to identify anything specific that would make one region or another standout.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Kyle Peterson with Needham. Please proceed with your question.
Kyle Peterson: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just want to talk a little bit about the expense trajectory. I know, you guys said that, you expect those to go up a little bit next quarter, given some investments pick in the DMS side? Does that outlook include the transition of some of the costs associated with the debt collection business? Or how should we think about kind of the expense trajectory and what transition costs and stuff you guys expect to occur?
Mike McLaughlin: We'll be able to provide more. Can you hear me?
Kyle Peterson: Yes.
Mike McLaughlin: Sure. So we'll be able to provide a little bit more detail on that when we get to the closing. So stay tuned next quarter for any more specifics we're able to share. In general, as we said in our remarks, we don't expect it to have material impact on profitability, which means that the expenses that we expect to remove, we're in the ballpark of the revenues that we are selling. And furthermore, we do continue to believe that our expenses for the year relative to last year will be about the same if not down little bit. So all the trends that we saw in our expenses, not including the impact of collection and recovery, divestiture, continue to play out and we still feel good about the full year.
Kyle Peterson: Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess just on the scores business. Quarter came in very strong. Is there any additional color you guys could give us on, what drove some of that strength between some of the recent pricing initiatives that you guys have taken versus just volume with some of the -- with healthy credit markets and the strong B2C business?
Will Lansing: I'd say, it's more on the volume than on the pricing, although the pricing is trying to feather in as card and some of the places where we put price increases in last year start to pick up in volume. So its both. But I tip to volume. And then, I think the real strength, mortgage continues to be strong and the real strength I think is B2C is just remarkable.
Kyle Peterson: Got it. That's helpful. Thanks guys. Nice quarter.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Surinder Thind: Good afternoon. Question on the B2C. Can you provide a little bit of additional color, obviously you provided some metrics, but the revenue growth sequentially was really strong after there was a temporary pause. Any color in kind of what drove that? Was there additional marketing with your partners that we should be thinking about maybe some seasonality? In any outlook, you can provide that would be helpful?
Will Lansing: No. I would I would put it in two categories, because the strongest part of it was myFICO. And I'd say it's attributable to very strong execution. There's some seasonality, of course, but I attribute some of the strength to very strong execution. And to consumer and consumers increasingly interested.
Surinder Thind: Got it. And what is the current mix between myfico.com and your partner at this point in terms of the B2C revenues?
Will Lansing: Here, I'm not sure we break that out. Mike, I don't know that we disclose that. Do we?
Mike McLaughlin: Yes. We don't disclose that. Sorry.
Surinder Thind: Got it. And then in terms of the special price increases that went into effect. If I believe I heard you correctly, you talked about them feathering in at this point. So how should we think about? Are they currently at the full run rate in this -- maybe at the full run rate in this quarter? Or maybe did half of them hit last quarter, two-thirds of them? How should we think about that mix?
Will Lansing: Well, I think you shouldn't think in terms of fully in except that the volumes that they were applied -- the kinds of scores they were applied to had lower volumes. And so as those volumes returned, you'll see a little more impact. But at this point volume going forward.
Surinder Thind: Got it. And if I understand correctly, it was mostly on the card and auto side for the impact?
Will Lansing: It was spread around, there was card -- there were card increases.
Surinder Thind: Got it. And how far below normalized levels is card volumes at this point? Obviously, auto volumes have fully recovered. We can pretty much track mortgage volumes on a daily basis, but there's less inside into card volume. Any additional color you can provide there?
Will Lansing: I really can't. I will say, that we have seen sequential increases in cards, which you can also see from the results this quarter of the card issuers and the bureaus. So we're seeing the same trends they see, and overall across our categories. So whether its cards, autos or mortgage volume trends that we've seen are not inconsistent with what you can see from or some others who are in those businesses.
Surinder Thind: Got it. That's its on my part. Thank you.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Caroline Conway with AllianceBernstein. Please proceed with your question.
Caroline Conway : Great. Thank you for taking my question. I'm curious about the implications of the divestiture on customer retention. And the strategy for expansion into new service areas with existing customers. What seem to me to be beneficial to keep a relatively full suite of financial services products available, especially as we look to drive DMS adoption, but that may be overestimating the role of this product line. So it would be great to get your thoughts on that strategically?
Will Lansing: No. You're absolutely right that our customers -- we have many customers who are customers of the collections and recovery product line as well as many other solutions that we provide. And we've always believed that, the broader suite of capabilities has high utility for our customers. This is really -- and our customers won't suffer from this. So our customers are going to wind up with continued tremendous support and innovation and investment in this product line from Jonas. And we have a close relationship with Jonas. We'll be doing coverage together. And so, I don't worry very much about whether our customers to well taken care of, because I'm confident that they will be well taken care of. What it does do is it frees up the resources and investment for us to focus on the platform side of the solutions that we provide to our customers. So no question that, that's the right place for us to be focused.
Caroline Conway : Great. And just as a follow up to that, are there any other components of the relationship with Jonas that you're expecting to emerge? Are there any products that you're expecting to leverage from their side?
Will Lansing: No. It's really a collection -- around collections and recovery. But then we have some parts of our FICO that will continue to operate in and near and around the collection space. So for example, FICO advisors will continue to provide consulting, advice around collections. But the generally speaking, the business is turned over to Jonas, and we'll make sure that the transition is seamless.
Caroline Conway : Okay. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Jeff Mueler with Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Jeff Mueler: Thank you. Good afternoon, on myFICO, so recognize your brand strength, recognize that part of the market is doing well in terms of the branded paid channel. I guess the indirect and some lead gen players pulled back. I'm not talking about your partners, I'm talking about alternatives in the market pulled back at points over the last year, which I think benefits the myFICO channel. Anything further you can say about execution, if it's changes in how you're going about marketing or changes in product? What I'm trying to get comfort with this some sustainability of myFICO strength, if some of those lead gen partners start to lean back into the market?
Will Lansing: Yes. It's a good question. And I it's hard for us to say whether the impact is from them pulling back or from our own excellent execution. What seems to be happening is there's a lot -- at least in my mind, is that there's a lot of appetite and interest in monitoring credit, particularly times like these. And it's a very natural place to go is myFICO.com. And as you know, we do actually relatively modest marketing around it. But the brand is very strong. We have over 90% aided awareness to the FICO brand in the U.S. And so it's not surprising that we got a lot of attention there. I think we will always be positioned -- we'll always position ourselves as an innovation leader and having really robust and fully featured products. And the premium -- we try to be the premium product in the marketplace, as well as a bit of a lab for experimenting with offerings that we then turn over to our partners, encourage them to replicate.
Jeff Mueler: Okay. And then just maybe any update on the uptake or usage of the resilience score index?
Will Lansing: It continues to be used, and it's in test with essentially. We have -- we actually have quite a number of lenders were using it now. And so far, the feedback is very positive. And we're not charging for it. It doesn't have any revenue impact.
Jeff Mueler: Right. Okay. And then last. I get that we're going to get the new, more typical software assess reporting financial metrics later in the year, but just -- can you help us ring fence like, what is on strategy revenue, like you talk about it, it feels to me like in several different ways you have I think, DMS, DMP there's, the SaaS versions of different products, you gave us a metric ex professional services. So can you just help us ring fence what you're viewing? It's kind of like core on strategy and where it sits today?
Will Lansing: Let me turn this over to Mike in just a minute to answer that question more fully. But what I would say is, everything that we have left in our portfolio is what we want to have in our portfolio. And it's a combination of legacy products and our platform products. We've been in a process of migrating and moving the capabilities from legacy products to the platform. And so increasingly, the new sales happen on the platform, we consider that to be truly strategic. So platform sales are where we want to be lend to South wells to land and expand, lets our customers who leverage a platform for small incremental investments get a lot incremental benefit. I mean, there's benefits for FICO and for our customers on the platform. That said, we have a really large business of FICO Solutions that are in place, on-prem, some in the cloud, but mostly on-prem. And we anticipate that those will be in use by our customers for many years to come. And so we continue to invest in those. We will continue to maintain those. We'll continue to make sure that our customers getting the full benefit of the investment that they made over past years. And as they're ready to migrate to the platform, we'll be ready to take them there. But the business really has both sides. And what you'll see is that the -- call it legacy solutions, the off platform solutions, we're not selling nearly as much of that going forward. And the energy is going into selling platform. But we'll be supporting both. Mike, if you want to add anything.
Mike McLaughlin: Sure. Hey, Jeff. Look, as we think about how to recast our reporting to be more helpful to you and our shareholders. The principles are, the focuses on recurring software revenue, hence are beginning to shine more of a spotlight on the services revenue, because those are declining. We're trying to make them decline, but we're just trying to focus on the services that really add value and let them reach their natural level in terms of revenue. The margin profile is not such that we generate a whole lot of value out of the services directly value to our customers and increase the stickiness and all that. But PS revenue for PS revenue sake is not something we're seeking. So our focus is on recurring software. And so our metrics will help you see that more clearly. Second, is the apps versus DMS distinction is less and less relevant. It's been in place for a long time in our disclosure, but it's outlived its usefulness. So we're likely to simplify and talk more about software versus scores as opposed to application scores and DMS. And then finally, the key -- the Prime Directive in our software business is platform. And so we'll help you get better insight into what our platform revenues are doing. And what's happening in our revenues that are -- call them to-be platform. Not yet, but on the roadmap. So those are the things we're trying to achieve as we think about how best to expose it to you.
Jeff Mueler: I think we all look forward to that. So thanks, guys.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the presentation back to Mr. Weber.
Steve Weber: Thank you. Thank you everyone for joining today's call. Have a good day. We look forward to speaking to you again soon. Thank you.
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-01-28 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings. And welcome to the Fair Isaac Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode and afterwards we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The conference is being recorded Thursday, January 28, 2021. And now, I’d like to turn the conference over to Steve Weber. Please go ahead.
Steve Weber: Thank you. Good afternoon. And thank you for joining FICO’s first quarter earnings call. I am Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I am joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike McLaughlin. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties, including the impact of COVID-19 on macroeconomic conditions and the company’s business, operations and personnel that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is concern -- is contained in the company’s filings with the SEC, in particular in the risk factors and forward-looking statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company’s earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company’s website at fico.com or on the SEC’s website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through January 28, 2022. And now, I will turn the call over to Will Lansing.
Will Lansing: Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining our first quarter earnings call. As we continue to deal with the effects of the pandemic, we remain focused on the health and safety of our employees. We are still primarily working from home and most of our offices remain closed. I am grateful to our dedicated employees who every day show their commitment to FICO and to our customers. On the Investor Relations section of our website we have posted some slides that offer financial highlights of our first quarter. I am pleased to say, we started 2021 well, as we continue to make progress on our strategic initiatives. We have reported revenues of $312 million, an increase of 5% over the same period last year. We are pleased with that result because we knew we would have headwinds on the software side as we transition toward more ratable recognition of our subscription software license revenues and our first fiscal quarter is typically our slowest software new business quarter. We delivered $86 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $2.90 per share, up 57% and 59%, respectively. On a non-GAAP basis net income was $82 million, up 51% and earnings per share of $2.74 was up 52% from last year, as we reap the benefits of the cost reductions we put in place last year. As we discussed last quarter, some of those savings will be reinvested as we identify opportunities and hire additional individuals in key strategic areas. We continue to deliver free cash flow growth as well. Q1 free cash flow was $75 million, up 39% from last year. I am encouraged by the progress we are making across the business. The decisioning market continues to grow and we are well-positioned to serve it. In fact, in December, Forrester issued a Digital Decisioning Platform report and named FICO as a leader in space. The FICO Decision Management Platform was recognized for providing all the tools necessary to manage and deploy digital decisions, which will stand up to the highest standard of regulatory rigor. We have been helping financial institutions make lending decisions for decades. We now bring that same level of automated analyst decisioning to the broader market to help businesses respond quickly to customers’ needs and anticipate their future demands. As we migrate more of our business toward a subscription based model including SaaS software subscriptions and term license subscriptions for on-prem software. We will see less upfront license revenue than we would have in the past as the revenue spread over the term of the deal. Last quarter we talked about how we would recognize less revenue upfront for on-premise licenses and that change pushed about $9 million of revenue this quarter out to future quarters. This doesn’t affect cash flows or total revenues recognized but it does delay the timing of revenues and over time will smooth the lumpiness we have historically seen. This changes in line with industry standards and we believe it will provide a more representative transparent view of the growth trajectory of our business. In our Application segment, we delivered $135 million revenue, down 11% from last year. This was due to a decline in upfront license revenues into a lesser extent professional services revenues. The license revenue was negatively affected by a smaller amount of term licenses upfront through renewal in the quarter and the revenue recognition change I mentioned earlier. In our Decision Management segment, we delivered $32 million of revenue, up 4%, despite many of the same issues we described in our Application segment. Our license revenue declined versus the previous year, transactional revenues in DMS were up 36%, providing the steady predictable recurring revenue stream that we believe will continue to grow. We have had a lot of interest in our decisioning platform and we sold a number of large deals in the best few quarters. We are working hard to install and get those customers live, so you can begin seeing the impacts from those recurring revenues. As I have often said, we are committed to becoming the preeminent platform player in decisioning analytics. This is the strategic focus of our software business. And like I said last quarter that may mean exiting non-strategic products or services, we are not signing or renewing low margin services led project work. Last fall, we sold our Enterprise Security Score business, because although we believe the effectiveness and value of the product is off strategy and need to remain incredibly focused to maximize the opportunity that’s in front of us. In December, we entered into a joint venture with a longstanding partner in China that distributes FICO Scores. And the joint venture will now distribute all software solutions for the China market. Moving forward, this will allow us to serve that market with less infrastructure and therefore a better margins. So this and the ESS deal will have a small near-term negative impact on topline revenues, but will help our overall margins and again allow us to focus on our overarching strategy. We expect more adjustments to be made of our software business as we make the necessary decisions to pursue our strategic initiatives. On the Scores side, the business continues to reform very well. Scores were up 26% in the quarter versus the prior year. On the B2B side revenues were up 20%. There was continued strength in mortgage originations volumes, although normal seasonality wasn’t quite as strong as our fourth quarter. Auto originations were relatively flat versus the previous year. We are starting to see signs of cards and other unsecured loans beginning to bounce back, as both prescreen and origination activities picked up in that space. As we discussed last quarter we did institute some price increases across various volunteers. Those price increases start to feather in during our second quarter and we can talk more about those impacts when we release the results of our March quarter. On the consumer side, we continue to drive growth. Our B2C revenues were up 40% versus same quarter last year. The growth at myFICO.com is even more impressive up 69% this quarter versus last year. The recent results of our myFICO business, as well as our partner’s experience, demonstrate that savvy consumers want the FICO Score, the Scores that lenders use. Finally, as you know, we haven’t provided guidance since the middle of our last fiscal year. We are still operating in a marketplace in the economy with a great deal of uncertainty and volatility. While our business has been remarkably resilient over the past year, it’s still difficult to quantify what macro trends will impact our volumes. So while we are confident in our prospects this year, we still believe that there’s a wide range of possible outcomes depending on the timing of vaccine rollout and the opening back up of the global economy. As we move through the year, we will provide more color than we believe it is prudent. I will give final comments in a few minutes, but first let me turn the call over to Mike for further financial details.
Mike McLaughlin: Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will walk you through our first quarter results in more detail and briefly discuss the impact we are seeing from the restructuring and impairment charges we took in the fall and the revenue recognition assumptions we talked about last quarter. Revenue for the quarter was $312 million, an increase of 5% over the prior year. Our applications revenues were $135 million, down 11% versus the same period last year. This quarterly decrease in revenue was primarily driven by decreased term license revenues. In our Decision Management Software segment, Q1 revenues were $32 million, up 4% over the same period last year. The revenue increase was due to increased SaaS subscription revenue partially offset by lower license revenues. As Will mentioned, our license revenues are down as we transition to a more ratable subscription revenue model. Last quarter we explained how we would be recognizing less of our on-premise software deals upfront license revenue and recognizing more revenue ratably over the term of the deal. In addition to this change we are also selling more SaaS deals which further reduces the upfront revenues. Finally, we are also deemphasizing a low margin of non-strategic professional services engagement, which will likely have a negative near-term impact on professional services bookings and revenues. This is driven by our core strategic goal of selling more high value recurring revenue software. Turning to our Score segment, revenues were $145 million, up 26% from the same period last year. B2B revenues were up 20% over the same period last year, driven by high volumes in mortgage originations, as well as some unit price increases across our Score categories. B2C revenues were up 40% from the same period last year. Both myFICO.com and B2C partner revenues grew significantly. Score’s revenue was down 5% sequentially from Q4, but as a reminder, last quarter we had a material onetime royalty true-up that increased reporting revenue. This quarter 80% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region, our EMEA region generated 14% and then the remaining 6% was from Asia-Pacific. Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter represented 81% of total revenues. Consulting and implementation services revenues were 13% of total revenues and license revenues were 6% of total revenue. SaaS software revenues not including related professional services revenues were $60 million for the quarter, up 4% from the previous year. Q1 bookings totaled $68 million, down 39% from the previous year. Those bookings generated $9 million of current period revenues, a 13% deal. SaaS bookings were $20 million for the quarter, down 45% from the previous year. Professional services bookings of $16 million were down 61% from last year. Our fiscal first quarter bookings are generally lower each year, particularly after a strong quarter like we delivered last quarter and our quarterly bookings can be quite volatile from quarter-to-quarter. We feel good about the bookings outlook for the rest of the fiscal year despite the relatively light bookings in Q1. However, it is important to note that we do expect bookings to trend lower overall as a result of our deemphasize on professional services sales and the somewhat shorter term lack of typical SaaS contracts. As we discussed last quarter, we have shifted the sales of our on-premise software away from the sale of separate license and maintenance components to subscriptions that include both the rights to use the software and ongoing maintenance. This quarter, we adjusted our revenue recognition to be consistent with this change and industry standards for software subscription sales. This change results in less upfront revenue recognized in the quarter we signed a subscription contract and more revenue from that contract recognized ratably during the term of the subscription. This quarter, the impact of this change was an in-quarter reduction of revenue of approximately $9 million. Those are revenues that would have been claimed this quarter under the old sales model and will now be recognized over the term of the contract. As a reminder, this will not have an impact on our quarterly cash flows or the total revenue recognized from software license sales over the term of each subscription contract. Our operating expenses totaled $218 million this quarter, compared to $289 million in the prior quarter. The current quarter included a $7 million gain on sale of product line assets and the prior quarter included $42 million of restructuring and impairment charges. Excluding those one-time charges, expenses were down $22 million due to decreased commission expenses associated with lower revenue, reduced incentive expenses and cost savings resulting from the restructuring actions we took last September. Compared to Q1 2020, operating expenses before one-time events were down $14 million, due to decreased marketing expenses resulting from a large customer event held in Q1 2020, lower travel and entertainment expense and cost savings resulting from our Q4 2020 restructuring. We do expect expenses to step up somewhat in the coming quarters and as we gradually redeploy the restructuring savings to add strategic headcount, primarily related to the development of our Decision Management Platform Software. Our non-GAAP operating margin as shown on our Reg G schedule was 36% for the quarter and margin expansion of 900 basis points from the same period last year. GAAP net income this quarter with $86 million up 57% from the prior year quarter and included a gain of about $7 million from the sale of our EFS types technology and our JV agreement in China. Our non-GAAP net income was $82 million for the quarter, up 51% from the same quarter last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 2%, including $19 million of reduced tax expense from excess tax benefits. We expect our FY 2021 recurrent tax rate to be approximately 26% to 27% and we expect the net effective tax rate for the year to be about 19%. Free cash flow for the quarter was $75 million, compared to $54 million in the same period last year, an increase of 39%. For the trailing four quarters free cash flow was $364 million. Turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter we had $145 million in cash, down $13 million from last quarter. Our total debt now stands at $881 million, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.2%. And finally return of capital, we bought back 101,000 shares in the fourth quarter at an average price of $494 per share. At the end of December, we had about $175 million remaining on the Board repurchase authorization and continue to do share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. With that, I will turn it back over to Will for his closing thoughts.
Will Lansing: Thanks, Mike. As I said in my opening remarks, we remain focused on building out our platform and taking it to an ever expanding marketplace. We will continue to invest at levels we think are appropriate to make the most of our incredible opportunity, and of course, we will continue to innovate and make the most of our incredible Scores asset. I am now turning the call over to Steve for Q&A.
Steve Weber: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks and we are now ready to take your questions. Operator, please open the lines.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Surinder Thind from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Surinder Thind: Good afternoon, gentlemen. My first question is actually on the Scores business. If we were to look at the B2C revenues, if my math is correct, they were roughly flat quarter-over-quarter. Can you provide a little bit of color there, because if we look back over the past few quarters there been a significant acceleration each quarter in the revenues and I thought that was a bit of a subscription based business. So if you can just help me understand what appears to be a sudden slowdown in new signings or if there is an offset -- where there’s new signings offset by certain individuals canceling subscriptions?
Will Lansing: I am not sure I follow the question.
Surinder Thind: So, for your B2B revenues, they -- if my math is correct, they were unchanged quarter-over-quarter. Can you provide a little bit of color, because if we look at the previous quarters, there was significant acceleration each quarter on a sequential basis and that doesn’t -- it didn’t appear to occur this quarter?
Will Lansing: That’s right. It didn’t appear this quarter. Mike, go ahead.
Mike McLaughlin: Yeah. I can jump in with some specific. So B2C revenues were up quarter-over-quarter, but not a lot, call it, $1 million. If you look back to Q4 to Q1, a year ago, it was kind of the same factor. So there is some seasonality Q4 to Q1 and the year-over-year compare continues to be very strong. But you are right, the quarter over quarter additions just were not as large as they were in the last two quarters particularly.
Will Lansing: And it’s worth adding that there was a settlement in the prior quarter.
Surinder Thind: Understood. On the Score -- on the B2B part. Understood. In terms of the -- and then maybe as my follow-up question, on the software side of the business, it seems like there’s a -- unless I -- it seemed like there’s a change in strategy to maybe focus more on the sales of SaaS products versus on-premise. Is that a little bit of a change from our previous discussions or the way because I thought the margins in the two businesses were relatively the same and that the thought was is that, from a plan perspective, that it was going to be a significant amount of time before the transition in your business occurred in that. Are you guys looking to accelerate…
Will Lansing: I would say, from a strategy standpoint, the way -- we don’t emphasize the one business over the other. We really try to do what’s appropriate for the customer. And so, while we love the characteristics of the SaaS business, where appropriate, we will absolutely do license on-prem deals and we don’t favor -- we don’t really favor one over the other.
Surinder Thind: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We have a question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Manav Patnaik: Yeah. Good afternoon. Good evening, I guess. So just on the software piece, so firstly the fraud licenses I guess the decline there. It sounds like most of that is because you are not renewing lower margin services. I was just hoping to get an example of what that is, because I would imagine anything enforced is probably valuable and worth sticking with. So maybe you can just help us how that decision works.
Will Lansing: Mike, do you have a view on that?
Mike McLaughlin: Yeah. Sure. So…
Manav Patnaik: Hi, Mike.
Mike McLaughlin: …if you look at the license -- yeah. Manav, if you look at the license itself. As we said, it’s -- and I am not just address fraud because probably the bigger question is that we are down about $15 million year-over-year from license sales. As we said about $9 million of that was purely related to the revenue recognition sale. It was also a quarter where we had less license renewals available to renew. If you followed us long enough then you know that that can be very lumpy. In Q3 we had another low quarter of last year, but Q2 was high. It just goes up and down. We can only renew that which is available. So it was a low renewal quarter. Not that we missed renewals or people didn’t renew, they just didn’t came up for renewal. And then the rest of it is just normal volatility and Q1 is particularly volatile, because it’s typically our smallest quarter. It can have the highest standard deviation. The services per se wouldn’t hit that fraud license line. It wouldn’t hit the total fraud business. An example of a services engagement that we would deemphasize would be some managed services that we perform for some of our customers, where we are helping them run the application on an ongoing basis. We do it well. It’s a good service. But it’s not strategic and so we are not emphasizing that. We are also engineering our products to be less professional services intensive when they are installed. So they can reduce the total dollars that our customers need to spend to install the product. So those are two examples of how and why professional services are -- we expect to be trending downward over time.
Manav Patnaik: Got it. Will, your comments around early signs of card, marketing, prospecting, et cetera, picking up. I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit there on which particular areas perhaps and how we should, I guess, that probably just ties to the reopening, just curious to what you think there?
Will Lansing: Well, I think, it is just that. I mean, we -- what we are seeing is the decline from a year earlier is not as great as it was. And so, while we clearly have a long way to go to kind of recover former volumes, the trend is in the right direction. So it’s -- we are seeing early signs of life.
Manav Patnaik: Got it. And just one last one for me, myFICO.com, I mean, I think, I understand why that’s doing so well because of the market macro out there. But are you guys doing anything really differently in that business to push them grow to at least over 69% this quarter or…
Will Lansing: I think I…
Manav Patnaik: … will set up for a big fall basically somewhere down the road.
Mike McLaughlin: Hard to say. I would say that it’s a combination of us doing things differently, because we are always trying to do things that run the business better. And we have got a crack team there that is constantly experimenting and innovating to improve the business. But that said, obviously, we are benefiting from the fact that we have so many consumers who are increasingly focused on their Scores and their FICO credit scores. And they come to myFICO to where an obvious place to come. We don’t promote it nearly as much as partners like experience. But consumers find us and we do some -- someone marketing ourselves. And so I’d say it’s both things. It’s -- we are benefiting from the environment we are in where consumers are more focused than ever and I don’t know how long that lasts. I think it could last a long time, but we don’t know. And then we are also benefiting from an excellent execution from the team.
Manav Patnaik: All right. Thank you.
Operator: We have a question from Kyle Peterson from Needham. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Kyle Peterson: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So I just wanted to touch a little bit on the expense and margin trajectory. Appreciate some of the color you guys mentioned on kind of reinvesting some of that as we go here. I mean, is it fair to think that some of the labor costs and savings you guys had this quarter will eventually be redeployed and maybe some of the savings of the facilities are kind of more permanent or how should we think about the cadence and level of this reinvestment?
Will Lansing: Maybe I will just take a quick stab at that, and Mike, you can give your view. Some of those labor savings will absolutely be redeployed into areas that are more strategic. So we are -- we have very healthy investment in our decision management platform and so some of those savings will be redeployed there. I think that on the facilities and some of the travel reduction expenses that are COVID related, some of that’s going to persist. I think some of that becomes permanent. Obviously travel, some amount of travel will resume, but I think we have all learned how to do business with less travel than we had before. And I mean, I am sure our experience is not unique. We have become a Zoom Video company, I mean we had it before COVID outbreak, but now it’s a way of doing business. And so I would think that even when everything comes back, we won’t see our travel expense at the same kind of level.
Mike McLaughlin: I add to that, Kyle, that we also, when everything comes back, won’t see our real estate facilities expense go back to the same model. Those restructuring actions and footprint reductions are -- we consider them to be permanent. On the labor side, yes, we are redeploying as we have talked about some of the savings back into particularly engineering talent from our platform products and we are not guiding particularly exactly how that’s going to move. But we did say last quarter and I continue to feel comfortable with, if you look at the full fiscal year, we expect our operating expenses to be flat to up a little bit, call it low single-digit percentages, we are still comfortable with that directionally.
Kyle Peterson: Got it. That’s helpful. And then I guess just a little bit a follow up on the gross margins. It seems like you guys are kind of strategically exiting some lower margin businesses especially in the services side. I mean should that lead to maybe a slight upward bias to gross margins over time? I realize that some of that will be kind of mix driven between Scores and software. But all is equal I just want to get any color that you guys could provide on the gross margin impact on deemphasizing services and some of these other businesses?
Mike McLaughlin: All else equal…
Will Lansing: I don’t think we have a lot of color -- go ahead, Mike.
Mike McLaughlin: Yeah. I was just going to say your math directionally is right. All else equal, if we deliver less professional services, it’s going to have a positive impact on gross margin, no question. The mix matters, for sure. But our professional services margins, gross margins are in line with what you would see at other well-run enterprise software companies that have in-house professional services and those margins are a lot lower than what typical software margins are.
Kyle Peterson: Okay. That’s helpful. Thanks guys. Good quarter.
Operator: Our next question is from Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Ashish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask a broader question about the platform strategy. Last quarter you talked about some good traction on that front. I was just wondering if you could provide any update on any other customer conversations and how should we think about the FICO Studio, how’s that coming along in the open API strategy? Thanks.
Will Lansing: The FICO Studio strategy is coming along just fine. We are on track. We have a quarterly release cycle and every quarter we make improvements. The API strategy is very much in place. We are very focused on that. We are also using the APIs internally today and we are in the process of turning those outward and documenting them so that others can use them. I actually think that the bigger hurdle for us will be around building a partner ecosystem that can leverage those APIs. So the -- getting the APIs out there is not something that we worry about. I think building the ecosystem takes a bit more work.
Ashish Sabadra: That’s very helpful color. And maybe just a follow-up question on the fraud piece -- the fraud solution piece. With this work-from-home, there’s definitely increased traction for fraud and digital identity solutions. You are seeing increased demand in the marketplace. TransUnion and Equifax also announced certain products and Equifax announced Kount acquisition as well. I was just wondering if you can just talk about the demand that you are seeing in the marketplace, but also talk about the competitive environment for Falcon, obviously Falcon is the market you there on the financial side, but any change in the competitive environment there? Thanks.
Will Lansing: We are not seeing tremendous changes. I mean Falcon is very much still the market leader and we are still selling Falcon in all its forms. So, we are not really seeing a difference there. I wouldn’t say that demand is way up nor is it down for Falcon. What we are doing in the fraud spaces is also looking at some, I would call it less traditional fraud opportunities for us and leveraging the decision management platform for them. So some of the lower cost not as heavy duty as Falcon, but some of the other clients of Falcon -- some of the other kinds of fraud solutions will be coming on the platform.
Ashish Sabadra: That’s very helpful. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Jeff Meuler: Yeah. Thank you. Hello, everyone. Will, I know that you said you are going to give us more detail next quarter on how the calendar ‘21 special pricing and B2B scores is feathering in. But just hoping you can confirm that four weeks in the execution of the special pricing implementation is going smoothly and as planned?
Will Lansing: Everything is going as smoothly as expected. Everything is going as planned. It really -- it happens later and so we will talk about it later.
Jeff Meuler: Fair enough. And then on software, any more perspective you can provide on license and maintenance? And I understand what’s going on from -- or I am sorry, for transaction and maintenance. And I understand what’s going on from a license perspective, but for transaction and maintenance, applications down year-over-year and I know that’s not usually a huge area of growth but it was down. And in DMS, it was, I guess, modest growth by DMS standards against what mathematically looks like not too tough of a comp.
Mike McLaughlin: Yeah. There is not…
Will Lansing: Mike, do you want to take that?
Mike McLaughlin: Yeah. A lot of the -- that is a category that is more usage-driven than fixed minimum-driven. It’s not entirely usage, by any means. And we did see some usage fluctuations this quarter in some of our products, some of which would be -- seem to be related to the macro, like, we saw less usage of our origination solutions in a couple of spots and then there’s normal variability in usage of things like fraud. Again some of that may be macro related and is less to credit card transactions or being processed so quickly. There is not a big story there. Again, I think, the big -- the bigger swing was just the license number overall, which was impacted, as described by the rev rec change and just the normal Q1 combined with just lower renewal paying as well.
Jeff Meuler: Got it. And then, Will, sorry to ask you to repeat yourself. But the mortgage comment in your prepared remarks, was it just that mortgage is seasonally a smaller percentage of the mix this quarter?
Will Lansing: The mortgage…
Mike McLaughlin: I think. Yeah. Go ahead, Will.
Will Lansing: Well, I am just going it’s -- mortgage holding up fine actually and so it’s -- for now it looks right.
Jeff Meuler: Right. I guess Equifax reported a mortgage inquiry should actually accelerate a little bit this quarter and I thought you had a comment that something related to mortgage. It almost like it was a lesser benefit than I just didn’t know if that was just seasonal mix or what you were saying and maybe I just misheard you?
Will Lansing: No. I don’t -- maybe I need to go consult my notes. I think that we don’t really opine on the future mortgage. You are better off looking to the bureaus and their forecasts than to us, because we are kind of a lagging indicator on that. But what we see and at least what we are seeing right now is strong mortgage.
Jeff Meuler: Yeah. Got you. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We have a question from Brett Huff with Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Brett Huff: Good afternoon, Will, Mike, and Steve. I hope you are all safe. Thanks for taking the question. Two big -- two bigger picture ones. We have been watching DMS for a long time and still think it’s a really important long-term strategic product. And I think, Will, you have talked about your commitment to that. And last quarter we had I think a big Brazilian bank that kind of win an enterprise on that. Anything in the pipeline similar to that or conversation that you can give us anecdotally, any sort of signs that this is -- this wave is starting to build a little bit?
Will Lansing: Yeah. I think it’s too early to talk about specifics, but we have a lot of DMS opportunities in the pipeline and various interests from large financial institutions. And so without being able get into specifics right now, I would say, that it is consuming a lot of our sales activity.
Brett Huff: Okay. That’s helpful. And then the second question is on margins, I know that we have been working through sort of enhancing our tech kind of infrastructure and then spending a lot of money on DMS and some of the SaaS application if you will, the platform solution. I know that we have talked about the potential margin benefit from that. But I know we are kind of running in a little bit to the rev rec change and some other things maybe exiting some businesses. Can you sort of give us a sense this year and next year, not numbers but just how we should think about margin benefits and headwinds as we look to see the business start expanding margins maybe a little more rapidly? Thanks.
Will Lansing: The margins -- it -- we have pulling and pushing in two directions. The margins are improving because we are getting better on expenses. W are -- our mix is changing with less PS. We are reviewing our products and identifying the ones that really aren’t contributing enough and are not strategic and so we talked about the China and ESS for example. But set against that is this incredible opportunity that we see with DMP or the Decision Management Platform. And we work through year-by-year what we can afford to spend on investing in it, but it’s not trivial. And given the market opportunity we are not going to shortchange it. So I think some of the margin improvement will be consumed by that incremental investment. Now, which way that goes? I know you are looking for a direction. Are margins getting better? Are they getting worse? Are they going sideways? We are just not prepared to say it yet. Flat is probably a good way to think about it. But I wouldn’t put a lot of stock in that because it could move. It really is a constant press internally for us to improve margins from an operating standpoint with cost reduction with getting better on pods all those kinds of things, while at the same time, recognizing that we are not going to miss this opportunity within the platform.
Brett Huff: That’s really helpful. Thank you, guys.
Operator: And we have a follow up question from Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Surinder Thind: Thank you for the follow-up question. A quick question on kind of the M&A front, you talked a little bit earlier about kind of fine tuning some of the businesses that you are in and being a little bit more focused. Is there an opportunity for M&A within that or has anything potentially changed there that we can think about or any needs that you might have?
Will Lansing: I don’t think a lot has changed. You know that our stance on M&A is we are always open and looking and we rarely find anything significant that makes sense for us. And the issue -- especially given our platform strategy, the issue is that, introducing business, other businesses with other code bases that we just have to be put on a path to be brought into our platform. It is a -- it’s just a little bit complicated and potentially our strategy. So while we are always looking, it makes more sense for us at this time to continue to invest organically and build organically. Now that said, we are always doing small acquisitions, typically talent acquisition, sometimes small technology acquisitions that fill little gaps. But in terms of large acquisitions, I wouldn’t hold my breath, but never say never it could happen, but it’s not imminent.
Surinder Thind: That’s very helpful. And then one other quick question. There were a lot of questions in kind of the bookings numbers and you guys provided some color on the seasonality component and how the first fiscal quarter is generally the weakest. Is there anything else, I mean, when I look back that number was actually the lowest that I have on record for you guys in the past three plus years. And so is there anything there to read into other than just the lumpiness in the sense that maybe clients are hesitating a little bit, is there maybe a little bit of uncertainty? What are those client dialogues or is it just clients are waiting for more of the DMS platform and maybe if you can talk about the roadmap for the DMS platform over the next year?
Will Lansing: I will take a stab and Mike can chime in. I think that the bookings, there is -- there are other changes going on. So for example, term length has shrunk a bit. That’s by design. It’s because we would rather have a renewal sooner than have it pushed way out, because we think there will be opportunities to do better down the line. So -- and that’s reflected in the sales compensation. It’s reflected in the fact that, meaning that our sales people are now compensated on kind of the annual recurring revenue as opposed to the full bookings value and that has a natural impact on internally. So I would say that’s one factor. I would also say, I am not sure it’s the right. I mean obviously we have been promoting it as a metric for ourselves for a long time and we are not going to stop sharing it. But I do think that over time we have to really start to focus on our business on this kind of annual recurring basis. Mike, do you want to add anything to that?
Mike McLaughlin: Yeah. I’d say that it does, look, it doesn’t feel like there is a COIVD or otherwise systemic hesitancy on the part of customers. You never can tell for sure. But the pipeline is still feels good. As we said, we still feel good about the full year on a new business basis and we came off of the highest ever booking quarter as you know in Q4 into what is seasonally the slowest quarter. So it’s -- again we don’t think that what you are thinking about is the case, time will tell. But the indicators we see is that the pipeline continues to look good for the year.
Surinder Thind: That’s very helpful. And then one kind of final question here, just the roadmap for the DMS platform over the next year?
Will Lansing: Yeah. I am not sure what we are prepared to disclose about the roadmap. We continue to make progress on Studio and we continue to work hard against getting the APIs turned outward, and I would say, those are the big points.
Surinder Thind: Okay. Thank you so much, guys. Thanks a lot.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time.
Will Lansing: Thank you. This includes today’s call. Thank you all for joining and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thank you and have a good day.
Operator: That concludes today’s call. Participant please -- thank you for your participation and please disconnect your line.

===== 2020 Q4  (2020-11-10 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings. And welcome to the Fair Isaac Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded it’s Tuesday, November 10, 2020. I would now like to turn the conference over to Steve Weber. Please, go ahead.
Steve Weber: Thank you, Eric. Good afternoon. And thank you for joining FICO’s Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. I am Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations and I am joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike McLaughlin. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties including the impact of COVID-19 on macroeconomic conditions and the company’s business, operations and personnel that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company’s filings with the SEC, in particular, in the Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company’s earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company’s website at fico.com or on the SEC’s website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through November 10, 2021. And with that, I will turn the call over to Will Lansing.
Will Lansing: Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. I hope you and your families are healthy and staying safe as we with the effects of the pandemic. At FICO we continue to make the health and safety of our employees a priority and are primarily working from home with most of our offices remaining closed. I’d like to take this opportunity to thank our entire team for their perseverance and their adaptability and their commitment to our customers. On the Investor Relations section of our website we posted some slides that I will reference during our presentation today. 2020 has been a remarkable year for all of us. At FICO we have been focused on navigating an extremely volatile and unpredictable environment. I am happy to report that our Q4 results again demonstrate not only the quality of our management team, but also the resilience of our business model. In our fourth quarter, we posted exceptional results that capped off a very successful fiscal year. We reported record revenues of $374 million, an increase of 23% over the same period last year. For the full fiscal year, we recorded $1.9 -- $1.29 billion of revenue, up 12% from fiscal 2019. We delivered $59 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $1.98 per share, even after taking a large charge and restructuring and impairment losses. On a non-GAAP basis, the $3.25 earnings per share was up 62% from last year. And we are delivering strong free cash flow growth as well. Q4 free cash flow was $135 million, up 51% from last year. Total fiscal year ‘20 free cash flow was $343 million, up 45% from fiscal ‘19. We had another solid year throughout our business and our Applications segment we had a great quarter of 12% versus last year in large part due to some Falcon license renewals. For the year, the segment was essentially flat for good result considering we entered the year with difficult comps as a result of large license sales in fiscal ‘19. Applications bookings in the quarter were $117 million, up 42% over the same period last year, and $282 million for the full year, up 6% versus fiscal ‘19. In our Decision Management segment, we continue to prove that we are gaining traction with our new technology. We again delivered our largest DMS revenue quarter ever, up 36% from last year’s fourth quarter and the segment was up 22% for the full year versus fiscal 2009 [ph]. Our bookings were even more impressive. We signed $99 million in new DMS deals this quarter, up 62% from the same quarter last year. For the full year we signed $199 million of new DMS deals, up 27% versus last year. Let me take a few moments to highlight the DMS success this quarter. First, we signed the biggest single platform in Centralized Decision Solution in company history with a large Latin American bank. The bank is looking to implement 19 different instances on our platform to derive the decision to support use cases related to auto, credit line management for the different retail products, and collections and others on the corporate platform. We are signing more deals and bigger deals as we find operators eager to use our advanced analytic tools to automate their most difficult decisions. We continue to focus our strategy of investing for platform success, we have been making coordinated changes across the business to grow revenue from our on-platform solutions, favorite software-over-services, optimize pricing and manage operating expenses. In our fourth quarter, we made some changes, including reducing headcount and some of our facilities footprint. Those were announced in September when we disclosed the charge we would be taking. Subsequent to the end of our fiscal year, we also made the decision to exit our FICO Cyber Risk Score business which we sold to institutional shareholder services last month. We don’t make these decisions lightly. We are committed to becoming the preeminent platform player in decisioning analytics and we need to be focused on that mission. That may mean exiting non-strategic products or not signing or renewing low margin project work. We are constantly looking at our business to identify areas for growth and improvement, and implement actions to deliver our strategic initiatives. We will continue to keep you updated on the progress we are making in our Software business and we will be providing more information in the coming quarters to explain the transformation we are making there. In our Scores business, we had another very successful year. Scores were up 32% in the quarter versus the prior year and up 25% for the full year. On the B2B side revenues were up 27% as we saw continued strong mortgage origination volumes. We saw a small rebound in auto originations in the quarter, while cards and other personal loan volumes continued to be down. The quarter also included a one-time true-up of royalty revenues. For the full year B2B revenues were up 26% compared to 2019. Our B2C revenues were up 45% versus the same quarter last year and 23% for the full year compared to last year. We continue to see incredible growth in myFICO.com, which was up 62% this quarter versus last year and are also getting good growth through our partners. As we look to our fiscal 2021, we see customers looking to accelerate their digital transformation and looking to our technology to facilitate the process. But we are also faced with a number of uncertainties. Obviously, we are all still dealing with the ongoing pandemic and all of the resulting health and economic impacts. We may see a new stimulus package from the federal government but with the just completed elections it’s difficult to predict any timing or impacts. It’s also difficult to predict what we will see in debt markets in the coming year. Obviously, the mortgage markets have been growing at phenomenal levels, but we can’t predict when or to what degree those markets will cool off. In auto and personal loans, there’s still a great deal of volatility and we cannot confidently predict how the next 12 months will play out. As in past years, we have instituted some pricing increases in various areas within Scores. But it’s also difficult to determine their potential impact because of volume uncertainty. We are coming off a quarter with record revenues and record bookings. But again, with an ongoing pandemic, it’s difficult to predict with certainty how quickly our solutions from the new sales will be implemented. In addition, our subscription-based go-to-market strategy will have an impact on the timing of revenue recognition in fiscal ‘21, causing less revenue to be claimed up front and more to be taken rapidly, which Mike will described in his remarks. We are proud of our business performed in fiscal ‘20 and are excited as we embark on a new year. But we are also realistic and understanding that we are in unprecedented times with many uncertainties. Because of this, we remain committed to providing as much transparency as possible, but are not providing guidance for fiscal ‘21 at this time. Have some final comments in a few minutes. But first let me turn the call over to Mike for more financial details.
Mike McLaughlin: Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. As Will said, we had a great finish to our fiscal year and we are able to post exceptional results in the midst of a tumultuous business environment. Revenue for the quarter was $374 million, an increase of 23% over the prior year. Our full year revenue of $1.29 billion was up 12% over last year. Within our three reported business segments, our Application revenues were $168 billion, up 12% versus the same period last year. The quarterly increase in revenue was driven by increased term license sales, including an unusually high number of large multiyear license renewals. Full year revenues for Applications were $602 million roughly flat with last year. Applications bookings were up 42% over the same quarter last year and up 6% for the full year. In our Decision Management Software segment Q4 revenues were $53 million, up 36% over the same period last year. Full year DMS revenues were $164 million, up 22% from fiscal ‘19. The revenue increases for both the quarter and the year were due to increase license sales, as well as increased SaaS subscription revenue. Q4 DMS bookings were $99 million, up 62% from the previous year. For the full year DMS bookings of $199 million were up 27% over last year. Finally, our Score segment revenues were $153 million, up 32% from the same period last year. The B2B part of the business was up 27% over the same period, driven by high volumes in mortgage originations and a one-time true-up of past royalties. B2C revenues were up 45% from the same period last year, both myFICO.com and partner revenues grew significantly. For the full year, Scores revenues were $529 million, up to 25% from last year. This quarter’s 74% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region, our EMEA region generated 18% and the remaining 8% was from Asia-Pacific. Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter represented 71% of total revenues, consulting and implementation services revenues were 13% of total quarterly revenues and licensed revenues were 16% of the total. SaaS software revenues not including related professional services revenues for the full year of fiscal 2019 were $237 million, up 11% from fiscal 2019. We had record total bookings in Q4 of $235 million, up 46% from the previous year. These bookings generated $34 million of current period revenues, which is a 15% yield. Full year bookings of $537 million represent an 11% increase from last year. SaaS bookings were $221 million for the year, up 18% from 2019. As you may recall, our total bookings lagged in Q2 and Q3 of this year due to disruptions from the pandemic. But the strong finish put us in line with our annual expectations. Our operating expenses totaled $289 million this quarter, including $42 million of restructuring and impairment charges. Excluding those one-time charges expenses were $247 million, compared to $231 million in the prior quarter, up $16 million due to increased expenses associated with additional revenue and incentives expenses. Our non-GAAP operating margin as shown on our Reg G schedule was 41% for the quarter and 34% for the full year. We delivered non-GAAP margin expansion of 400 basis points for the full fiscal year. GAAP net income this quarter, which again included one-time charges was $59 million, up 8% from Q4 and fiscal 2019. Our non-GAAP net income was $97 million for the quarter, up 59% from the same quarter last year. For the full year, GAAP net income was $236, including $45 million of restructuring impairment charges, and $50 million of reduced tax expense from one-time excess tax benefits recognized upon the settlement or exercise of employee stock awards. Non-GAAP net income was $292 million, up 28% from prior year. Our effective tax rate for the full year was 8%, including the $50 million of reduced tax expense from excess tax benefits. We expect our FY 2021 recurring tax rate to be approximately 26% to 27%, compared with 28% at FY ‘20. That expected recurring tax rate is before an estimated excess tax benefit of approximately $20 million in FY 2021. The resulting net effective tax rate is estimated to be about 20% in fiscal ‘21. Free cash for the quarter was $135 million, compared to $90 million in the same period last year, an increase of 51%. For the full year free cash flow was $343 million, up 45% from last year’s $236 million. Turning to balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had $157 million in cash. This is up $32 million from last quarter due to cash generated from operations, partially offset by $25 million of share repurchases. Our total debt now stands at $845 million with a weighted average interest rate of 4.3%. Turning to return of capital, we bought back 60,000 shares in the fourth quarter at an average price of $423 per share. In fiscal 2020 we repurchased a total of 675,000 shares at an average price of $348 per share for a total of $235 million. At the end of September we had about $225 million remaining on the Board repurchase authorization and we continue to do share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. Finally, as well mentioned, we have recently shifted the sales of our on premise software, away from the sale of separate license and maintenance components to subscriptions that include both the rights to use the software and the ongoing maintenance. As a result at the beginning of FY21, we adjusted our revenue recognition assumptions to be consistent with industry standards for software subscription sales. This change will result in less upfront revenue recognized in the year we sign subscription contracts, and more revenue from those contracts recognized ratably during their term. This will likely result in a material decline of our software license revenues in fiscal ‘21. As a greater percentage of the total expected revenue to be received from newly signed on-premise subscription sales and renewals of existing term licenses or spread over the term of the deal. This will not have an impact on our cash flows, or the total revenue recognized from software license sales over the term of each subscription contract. With that, I will turn it back over to Will for his thoughts on FY21.
Will Lansing: Thanks, Mike. As I said, in my opening remarks, I am proud of our team and what we were able to accomplish in fiscal 20. I am excited about our prospects are 2021 and beyond. Clearly, there is uncertainty. But we are confident that our future is bright. We can’t pin down exact expectations, but we have proven our businesses remarkably resilient. And we are well positioned for the future. We will continue to innovate fine tune and improve our business model with an eye toward improving margins and delivering on our potential. And we look forward to keep you all informed as we progress. Now, let’s turn to Q&A.
Steve Weber: Thanks, Will. This concludes our remarks. Eric, if you could please open the lines for questions.
Operator: Absolutely. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik. Please go ahead.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. Good evening, guys. Just on the software business clearly, a solid end to the year to you. You characterize it as a backlog that kind of pause because of the pandemic. But I was hoping you could give us just a little bit more color on how the clients are viewing the next few quarters ahead I guess. Is the fact that you ended strong just find that they are back to normal or is there some shift in where they are finding these deals?
Will Lansing: Hi, Manav. I think that, I wouldn’t say things are back to normal. But I would also say that with respect to the software that banks buy from us, things didn’t change that much. Remember, we have a very long sales cycle, 270 days on average. And so a lot of what we have booked in 2020 was pipeline built even earlier. We are now in the process of building pipeline for 2021. We have some pipeline built. We have more to build. And it’s a little hard to say how it will all turn out. But I would say that our customers are they have the same needs for the software that they had before the pandemic, if anything, there is increased appetite, because the pandemic has gotten everyone focused on digital transformation. And, and our software obviously plays really well for that. So I anticipate continued interest, I don’t think we are just working off backlog.
Manav Patnaik: Okay. Got it. And then if I may just on the score side, plus can you just quantify how much the two upgrades that he talked about? And then secondly, just going into next calendar year, I guess, how should we think about the pricing initiatives that you have been doing in the last few years, like, should we be expecting another one?
Will Lansing: We can’t disclose the amount of the true that’s held confidential. But as you know, these things happen every several years. We wind up doing a trip of this sort. With respect to the pricing actions and scores, we took some actions, but as in years past, we don’t really know exactly how it will feather in we don’t know exactly what volumes will be. And so it’s a little hard to predict. I would say not a lot more nor a lot less than years past is probably a way to think about it. But it’s -- we have uncertainty, we always -- we wind up getting the activity and or from the Bureau’s and that’s just the way it is.
Manav Patnaik: Got it. And if I can just squeeze in one minute just selling this hybris core business to ISS, I guess. I don’t know if you have ever sold a prune portfolio before. So I was just curious it’s something is there a fresh milk is a lot more that maybe we can see coming?
Will Lansing: Yes. Good question, Manav. We have undertaken a pretty massive strategic look at our business over the last six, seven months. We hired in a former McKinsey Director, Tab Bowers to help us. And we have been really focused on what is strategic and what is not. And so we are -- the things that look promising, but they really are not central to our mission for building a decisioning platform, are definitely being moved to the periphery and cyber risk course example, when those sold, we are proud of it. It was good technology. But our success in the decisioning platform business doesn’t turn on whether we are successful in cyber risk score. So at some level was a distraction for us. Are there other things like that we are in a state of constant evaluation, and we hope to find some things that are less strategic and free up resources for more strategic.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from a line of Kyle Peterson with Needham. Please go ahead.
Kyle Peterson: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to touch a little bit on the SG&A trajectory, you guys took some restructuring kind of rationalized headcount in real estate, how should we think about kind of the expense trends over the next coming year given that, it seems like some of these efficiencies could be permanent, but not sure whether you guys are going to reinvest part of that in some higher growth areas such as DMS.
Will Lansing: Yes. I will give you some quantitative thoughts. And then maybe we will can provide qualitative. Big part of the reduction in expense run rate in the second half of the year with T&E. You can see from the additional slides we provide, as a part of this call that are going into the pandemic, T&E run rate was about $30 million to $35 million a year. I think it was something like $100,000 in Q4. So that’s not going to persist, but it’s probably going to be less than 30 to 35. So even if we do have a vaccine and get back to normal. So that’s one moving piece. We have also taken action to reduce our geographic footprint and to a minor extent reduce headcount in non-strategic areas that real estate saving will accrue over the years. And so that will be a one way benefit. That isn’t going to change. But with respect to some of the headcount reductions, we actually did that so that we could reinvest, if not all of that money into headcount augmentation in areas related to the software platform, to pursue our strategic ambitions there. So we expect overall expenses for the business, probably, again with the pandemic so much is uncertain. But we expect flat to single digit growth and expenses as the year goes on, maybe we will do better than that. If perversely, we can travel for the whole full year. Hopefully, we can and we have some money to spend in that category. But hopefully, that at least gives you some color.
Kyle Peterson: Yes. That’s helpful. Thanks for the color. And like it’s just more of a housekeeping item, particularly on some of these longer term licensed sales that you guys recognize this quarter. Was that more on the application side? Just trying to think about how we should incorporate that into our model moving forward?
Will Lansing: Yes. If you look at the segment breakout in the 10-K, you can figure that out, you have to do a little quarterly subtraction math, because we don’t show the quarter-over-quarter comparison in a friendly way as we might. But the licensed growth was really driven by renewals. We had a healthy new business license sale quarter as well as we would expect in the fourth quarter of particularly given some of the delayed purchases that flowed over from Q2, Q3. But if you look at our $62.5 million of licensed bookings for the quarter, which is up of that $21 million or so is renewal that renewals in excess of renewals we had in the year ago quarter. So -- and then just for better, worse, they are lumpy, we have to recognize a lot of upfront. And so, it was both increase in new business sales, which was up sort of mid to high teens from year-over-year, but most of the increase, but not always, just by this lumpiness of renewals that happened to be a whopper renewal quarter.
Kyle Peterson: All right. Great. Thanks, guys. Nice quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. Please go ahead.
Jeff Meuler: Yes. Thanks and good evening everyone. I wanted to ask on B2C scores, kind of a really, really good quarter. On the myFICO side recognize you have a strong brand, recognize the direct is the part of the market that’s been performing well lately, but anything that you have changed for myFICO, either in terms of go to market or product or just any other changes that are driving that exceptionally strong result?
Will Lansing: I would say it’s more on the market side than on our side, but we are constantly innovating over there. We are constantly pushing the -- trying to push the value that the consumer gets in that offering. Our strategy around myFICO is to be kind of best-in-class credit monitoring for consumers. And at the same time, we mostly go to market through partners like Experian. And so, myFICO is at some level of laboratory for us, a place to test out ideas, to test out value proposition changes. And so, we are always doing that. That’s not like a new thing this year, we constantly do that. I think that the biggest thing responsible for the lift is consumer demand. And then the consumer is really interested in tracking his or her credit score.
Jeff Meuler: Yep. Okay. And then Mike, just on these accounting changes, I just want to make sure that -- I guess a couple of clarifying questions, but there’s no change to the timing of expense recognition would be one question. And then my guess is -- are you viewing booking as kind of the best way to track the performance of the business throughout 2021? And I think that’s unaffected? Or is there some other kind of metric or some way that you are going to be adjusting revenue to give us a like for like impact or something to track the performance of the business as we progress through 2021?
Mike McLaughlin: Thanks for those two questions. The first one definitely merits some additional detail, I think for everyone listening in the call. So the change really is to get in line with industry standard for how subscription software is recognized. We had been recognized revenue for on-premise term license sale essentially in the way that you would recognize a perpetual license sale where you had a one-time license upfront and then 20% maintenance every year. We were treating the total contract value of term license in sort of the same way. That lead to about between 80% and 85% of the total contract value for a multi-year deal being recognized in the year you sign it, when you sign it, and only 17% -- 15% to 20% recognized ratably in years two and three. With this change, again, which is what the vast majority of subscription software companies already do, we are shifting that revenue recognition to better reflect the fact that the value of the ongoing support and maintenance for the on-prem software in a term license as opposed to a professional license situation is higher than what we had been recognizing before. That nets out to about a 30% reduction in the percent of TCV, contract value recognized in year one versus years two, three, and in some cases years four and five. So when you think about the revenue side, and I know you have asked about the expense side as well, we had $120 8 million of license revenue in our software business in fiscal 2020. Going forward, we would recognize about 30% less of that in the first year and 30% will then be recognized as recurring revenue in the remaining years of the contract. So it’s all about revenue recognition for accounting purposes. It doesn’t change when we build a customer, how much we build them, or what total revenue will recognize over the term of a contract. So, hopefully, that’s clear. And you can do your own math on how much of a headwind that will be for revenue, but it will be a headwind for fiscal 2021 for sure. We want to make sure everybody notice that. With respect to expenses, these are on-prem license sales. So there aren’t that much -- there isn’t that much expense associated with it. Margins -- our on-prem business are consistent with what others earn 90 plus percent. So that -- but it will change revenue recognition a little bit to the extent that we recognize more revenue ratably we match expense with the revenue recognition, but that’s not going to be a material impact relative to the revenue impact. And then you asked about booking, separate question. Yes, for now, that’s the best indicator to measure our current period performance in generating new revenue. It’s not a perfect metric, as you know it’s on a TCV basis, so term length matters, but we are sticking with that metric for now. As we move more to a subscription and SaaS business, annual recurring revenue and its derivatives becomes more important to us. And we do expect to be able to expose to you guys at some point during this fiscal year, just kind of metrics for FIFO, but we are not ready to do that yet.
Jeff Meuler: Got it. Sorry for the three partner. I appreciate all the detail.
Mike McLaughlin: Thank you for the questions.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens Incorporated. Please go ahead.
Brett Huff: Good afternoon, guys.
Will Lansing: Hi, Brett.
Brett Huff: Good. Just a quick follow up on pricing. Could you guys give us a sense -- I think sometimes you have given us a sense of which part of scoring you sort of dug into and we are tweaking the pricing on? Could you - any insight there that you could share with us for this new round of price tweaks?
Will Lansing: Yes. To the extent we are willing to share that information, it’s less to do with the type of scores and it’s more to do with the size of the customer. So we are into a more kind of a tiered pricing philosophy. And so I would say that the price increases were spread across the spread -- scores portfolio with a view to the size of the customer buying the scores.
Brett Huff: And I am assuming that that the smaller customers may have been getting a pretty good deal for a long time and maybe we are tweaking that based on just volumes.
Will Lansing: Yes. Yes. Absolutely. And I would say they are still getting a good deal, but not as good a deal.
Brett Huff: In terms of bank buying behavior, you touched on this a couple of times. I know your sales cycles are long. And so, when things exactly come out of the pipe and get booked, I know it takes a while. But as you are having conversations with folks, I know you mentioned digitization is really important. But as you think about Falcon’s strategy director, debt collector, sort of those key apps, any sort of detail on the conversations there that that stick out that might be useful to know?
Will Lansing: What’s interesting is, historically, we have provided for lack of a better term point solutions for our bank customers, originations and customer management and fraud and collections and recovery as you know. What we are seeing -- what we saw last year and what we are starting to see more of is more engagement with the IT department, more engaged with the CIO, and a better understanding on the part of our customers have just the benefits and value of the platform. So while they may still be buying a solution like originations, now they appreciate that it’s originations on top of the platform. And there is all kinds of potential that goes with that where for small incremental investments they get large incremental value out. I think that’s the biggest change we are seeing in the conversation is customers increasingly understanding our strategy around platform and looking to leverage it.
Brett Huff: Okay. And then any update on the sort of the master plan of moving everything over to sort of the core underlying DMS platform on the app side. Can you just -- sometimes you sort of say we expect Falcon going to be completely done in a year or whatever. Can you just give us the update on that to remind us where we are in terms of finish line?
Will Lansing: Yes. So I guess the honest answer is our work is never done. Okay. So it’s not like we will just say, okay. Now it’s on the platform, we can all go home. It’s a process. And so we have moved some core fraud applications from Falcon onto the platform. Our compliance is now available in Falcon X on the platform. We are also looking at, I would say, more flexible and modular approaches to providing fraud solutions on the platform. So there will be some of that. Some of our applications aren’t going to make it to the platform. So, for example, collections and recovery has a massive code base, 8 million lines of code. And it just doesn’t make sense to rewrite it onto the platform. And so that will remain a distinct code base. So, when are we done? I guess another way to think of it is, when are we going to feel that the platform is sufficiently mature that customers who want to have multiple use cases on the platform have that work? I think we are almost there. Now, we are pretty much there. This Latin American bank deal that we just referenced, it started out with a conversation about a handful of use cases that they would want to do on the platform and they we are up to 19. And I think there’s more in the future. So it’s a different way of thinking about the value that we provide.
Brett Huff: Great. Thank you so much. I appreciate it.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jake Williams with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Jake Williams: Good evening, everyone.
Will Lansing: Hi, Jake.
Jake Williams: Can you help us to understand how much of an impact mortgage items were in this quarter in the B2B Square segment?
Will Lansing: Like last quarter, Experian -- Equifax and TransUnion reported before us last week and end of the prior week, and you can see how they broke out mortgage volumes. We don’t break out mortgage volumes, but we can say that what we saw was consistent with what they told The Street they saw. I think one showed up 45% in terms of volume and the other was closer to 60%, although it’s a little unclear whether that was for the quarter itself or sort of run rate including the last -- including the month of October, but our volumes were consistent with what you could see from them.
Jake Williams: Got it. And then in terms in the average bookings term stretched out to 55 months this quarter from 37 was that impacted by the decision to change the revenue recognition on-prem or is this an independent evolution?
Will Lansing: No. It’s independent. It’s not related to that. What is related to is we had some deals that are really long-term deals long, much longer than typical than has been our usual. And I would say that that trend could continue. We will have to see how things play out. But I think when banks adopt our platform and standardize on the platform, it’s not surprising that they would want to lock us in for a long period of time with an understanding of what it’s going to cost. So I think there’s going to be pressure for longer-term deals on us.
Jake Williams: So can we assume that the clients are the ones who are coming to you asking for this long-term deal to give them stability and in return there’s probably some price escalator built-in each year.
Will Lansing: Yes. We try to be smart about it and yes it’s definitely client request.
Jake Williams: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Surinder Thind: Good afternoon. Following up on earlier question about just the DMS platform, maybe can you provide a little bit more color on the investments you are making in terms of the -- you are redirecting some of the 36 billion in savings that you have towards additional headcount for the build out of that platform. Is that simply we are just trying to accelerate the build out of certain functionality? I was just hoping for maybe a better understanding of where the roadmap is in terms of, I think, ultimately we are trying to get to, I guess, in terms of the function that we currently have versus where it will be fairly equivalent product to your on-prem and in your old architecture cloud stuff?
Will Lansing: So part of the strategy of the platform is to is to have a lot of interoperability around the data, right? So we have a data orchestration layer. We can take data from lots of different places and bring it into the platform. And then we have a wide range of analytics that can be applied to that data. And then we have various solutions that sit on top of that platform, of that decision platform to meet specific needs. Our strategy with the platform has been to -- as we migrate our applications to the platform, the way we think about it is we say, what are the components of this solution that we ought to modularize, what are the micro services that are involved here and let’s break them up and make them available to users of the platform, so they can be mixed and matched in different ways. And so that’s really kind of the heavy lifting that’s going on. We have also put a lot of energy into a thing called FICO Studio, which is kind of a front end fourth generation language kind of a programming environment where you can drag and drop a lot of things to build workflows based on the decisioning analytics in the platform. So there’s a lot of work that’s gone into that. But the way we think about it is not let’s port an application to the platform. It’s more break up the application into its component parts, understand how they can be micro services that could be consumed in independently and then bring those to the platform so they can be reassembled on the platform for all different kinds of purposes.
Surinder Thind: Fair enough. And then in terms of just a bigger picture question, obviously with a potential change in the administration, is there any other considerations that enter into picture here where maybe could there be, let’s say, an acceleration in the upgrade cycle for, let’s say, from FICO 8 to FICO 9 or even to FICO 10 or something for that matter that might drive based on the differences in the policy administrations.
Will Lansing: I am not sure that we will have a change in the rate and pace of adoption of new scores under -- based on the administration. I do think that all lenders are really focused right now on how do they get the most value out of scoring algorithms and they are increasingly using things like FICO resiliency index to complement the traditional FICO score to make these decisions. I wouldn’t say that’s driven by the administration. I think that’s more driven by the innovation coming out of our scores team. But there’s a tremendous appetite on the side of the banks to get the full benefit out of it. And so, we are pretty focused on that.
Surinder Thind: Thank you. And then just a quick one on -- or maybe on the B2C revenues obviously really strong growth there. I am assuming the run rate is what is a sustainable run rate at this point? Is there any color you can provide on how -- is this just -- there’s just this initial phase where we should expect this big ramp up that we have seen with the kind of the dislocation in the markets? Or how should we think about the growth rate forward should…
Will Lansing: I think that we definitely…
Surinder Thind: …I am a little bit or how long do customers stay on the platform?
Will Lansing: I think we have definitely enjoyed a spike because of the environment. There’s no question that consumers are more focused than ever on their score and whether it’s going up or down, I get letters in the mail all the time. And that’s definitely the environment driving that. So I would say the 62% spike I referenced earlier that is -- that’s driven by the environment. In terms of the lifetime value, how long they stay on. We have not -- it’s too early to tell, but we haven’t seen changes. So what we are seeing so far is kind of the same attrition over time that we have historically had. So we will stay.
Surinder Thind: Okay.
Will Lansing: What we have noticed is that there’s an inexorable trend to consumers being ever more focused on their credit score. I mean, this has been every year, year in, year out has become bigger and more important to them. And so, I am not sure that it’s like a spike up and then a ramp down. I mean, it may just be part of a trend.
Surinder Thind: That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: All right. Thank you. And Mr. Weber, we have no further questions from the phones at this time. I will turn the call back to you.
Steve Weber: Thank you. This concludes our call today. Thank you all for joining, and we will look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-07-29 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the FICO Quarterly Earnings Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we’ll conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, July 29, 2020. And now, I’d like to turn the conference over to Steve Weber. Please, go ahead.
Steven Weber: Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining FICO’s Third Quarter Earnings Call. I’m Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations. And I’m joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike McLaughlin. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements may involve many uncertainties including the impact of COVID-19 on macroeconomic conditions and the company’s business, operations and personnel that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company’s filings with the SEC, in particular, in the Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company’s earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company’s website at fico.com or on the SEC’s website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through July 29, 2021. And now, I’ll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
William Lansing: Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. I hope you and your families are healthy and staying safe as we go through this pandemic. We continue to work primarily from home. Most of our offices are remaining closed. I’m pleased to say this model has worked very well for us. Our productivity metrics remain very strong. And we’re able to innovate, meet development deadlines, serve our customers and implement our solutions. We posted some slides with our results on the Investor Relations section of our website. I’ll be referencing some of those slides during our presentation today. I’ll go over the results of our third fiscal quarter and discuss what we’re seeing in the markets that we serve. I am pleased to report that we had another very strong quarter, which demonstrates the remarkable resiliency of our business. As shown on Slide 2, we reported revenues of $314 million, flat with the same period last year, which was our highest revenue quarter ever. We delivered $64 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $2.15 per share. We delivered $77 million of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS of $2.58. We also delivered $99 million of free cash flow in the quarter, the highest single quarter in company history. As you can see, on Slide 3, we continue to have ample liquidity. We actually reduced our total debt by about $20 million from the end of our second quarter. We generated $106 million in new bookings and have a very strong pipeline of deals as we move into the fourth quarter. Our software revenue was down 8% this quarter due to the difficult comparison to last year, when we have large application renewal revenue. This quarter, the application segment was down 15%, primarily due to lower upfront license revenues. Decision Management Software was up 22%, primarily due to increases in recurring transactional revenues. In the Scores business, we had another record quarter, despite the volatility in the credit markets. Total revenues were up 14% versus the prior year and totaled $132 million. B2C revenues were up 21% this quarter with strong growth in both myFICO and indirect partner channels. On the B2B side, revenues were up 12% over the same period as last year. This is especially encouraging as this is an area that can be highly volatile in uncertain economic times. We saw strength in the mortgage markets throughout the quarter with volumes up due to low interest rates. In auto, volumes are down significantly at the start of the quarter and improved over the balance of the quarter. For cards and other unsecured lending, marketing and originations volumes were down throughout the quarter, as financial institutions slowed new card acquisition efforts. Obviously, there’s still a great deal of volatility in these markets with record unemployment and furloughs. We also continue to innovate in Scores. Last month, we introduced the FICO Resilience Index, an analytic tool that complements the FIFO score and helps lenders, borrowers and investors to identify the financial resiliency of consumers across FIFO Score bands to make more informed and precise decisions in assessing risk during rapidly changing economic cycles. In general, in a down economy, access to credit goes down as lenders try to mitigate the credit risk. The FICO Resilience Index can be helpful in navigating through changing economic cycles. The desired outcome is a system that is even more precise in assessing and pricing risk and less prone to broad credit restrictions and risk pricing, which can tighten the flow of credit during an economic downturn. As we navigate through the current economic climate, I’m extremely pleased with the performance of our business. Last quarter, we retracted our full-year guidance due to widespread economic uncertainty. We now have additional data points, but markets have yet to stabilize. So while we won’t give formal guidance, we are offering additional visibility into how various metrics are trending as we finish our fiscal year. If you look at Slide 4, an updated version of what we showed last quarter, you’ll see how we performed in Q3 and where we stand year to date versus our original guidance. We’re trending well in Scores with both B2B and B2C ahead of our original guidance. On the Software side, we’re slightly behind in transactional and maintenance volumes as reduced economic activity has slowed volumes. We also have risk in license sales and services revenue. Our fourth quarter tends to be the highest sales quarter for us. And we have a strong pipeline of deals. We see clients accelerating their digital transformation plans where we play a central role. But again, with the uncertain economic environment, it’s difficult to commit to specific revenue numbers. On the expense side, we’re spending well below what was embedded in our guidance. As a result, we will likely have some savings versus what we expected at the beginning of the year. While there are still many moving pieces, we now believe it’s likely that we’ll be able to hit our previously guided pre-tax income and net income numbers, In many ways this is the most difficult health and economic environment we’ve ever faced. At the same time, we have a very resilient business model, and we’re actively managing the business to work through the near-term difficulties with an eye toward our long-term strategy. I’ll share some summary thoughts later. But now I’d like to turn the call over to Mike for further financial details.
Michael McLaughlin: Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the quarter was $314 million flat with the prior year, and up 2% from the prior quarter. Year-to-date, revenue was $920 million, up 8% from the prior year. Our Applications segment revenues were $141 million, down 15% versus the same period last year. This decrease in revenue was driven primarily by lower license revenue. As you may recall, we had a very large license component in Q3 last year due to renewals, which under ASC 606 accounting standards require upfront revenue recognition even though we build a customer as an annual subscription. Software applications billings for the quarter were $61 million flat versus last year, and up 27% from our second quarter, where we had significant COVID-related disruptions and sales efforts at the end of March. In our Decision Management Software segment, Q3 revenues were $41 million, up 22% over the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to SaaS subscription revenues in our decision management platform. DMS bookings were $29 million in Q3, down 22% from the previous year, but up 25% from the last quarter. Finally, our Scores segment revenues were $132 million, up 14% from the same period last year. B2B was up 12% over the same period, and B2C revenues were up 21% from Q3 2019. In our third fiscal quarter, 79% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region. Our EMEA region generated 14% and the remaining 7% was from Asia-Pacific. Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources represented 79% of total revenues in the quarter. Consulting and implementation revenue were 14% of total revenues and license revenues were 7%. Revenues derived from our cloud delivered software as a service or SaaS were $77 million for the quarter, an increase of 11% over the prior year that included $61 million of transactional software revenue and $16 million in professional services. Bookings for the quarter totaled $106 million, down 3% from last year, but up 26% from last quarter. These bookings generated $16 million of current period revenues, a 15% yield. SaaS bookings were $40 million for the quarter, down 12% from the previous year, but up 31% from last quarter. Our operating expenses totaled $231 million this quarter, down $1 million from the prior quarter. This is due primarily to decreases in travel, marketing and other discretionary expenses. We expect Q4 expenses to be moderately higher. Our non-GAAP operating margin as shown in our Reg G schedule was 34% for the quarter. GAAP net income this quarter was $64 million flat with the prior year. Our non-GAAP net income was $77 million for the quarter, which was up 1% from the same quarter last year. Our effective tax rate this quarter was about 16%, which included $5 million of excess tax benefits resulting from stock-based compensation activities. We expect our effective tax rate to be around 9% to 11% for the fiscal year. As a reminder, our recurring tax rate before these excess tax benefits is approximately 25% to 26% globally. Free cash flow for the quarter was $99 million compared to $61 million in the same period last year, an increase of 63%. Free cash flow this quarter benefited from a large reduction in the working capital year-over-year, primarily related to unusually high accounts receivables at the end of Q3 2019. Free cash flow for the trailing 4 quarters was $297 million. Turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter, we had $126 million in cash, which is up $19 million from last quarter due to cash generated from ops, partially offset by share repurchases. Our total debt face value is $938 million, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.38%. At the end of the quarter, we had drawn $103 million on our $400 million revolving line of credit. We further drew on that facility to pay for the $85 million maturity of senior notes in July. Our leverage ratio as calculated for revolving line of credit was 2.16, and our covenant as you may recall is 3.25 on the revolver. We bought back 157,000 shares in the third quarter for $54 million at an average price of $343 per share. And today, we announced the new board authorization for $250 million of share repurchase. Finally, as Will said, because of the current uncertain economic environment, we are not providing formal financial guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2020. With that, I’ll turn it back over to Will for some final comments.
William Lansing: As we work to finish our fiscal year and build plans for fiscal 2021, I’m confident that FICO is well positioned for the future. We’re built to withstand economic downturns and are taking steps to manage through current uncertainties without sacrificing our commitment to our strategic initiatives. As I’ve said before, we are stewards of remarkable assets. And we have a great team dedicated to helping our customers solve their most difficult problems. And the value of the analytic solutions we provide both in software and in Scores is more important now than ever. I’ll turn the call back over to Steve to manage the Q&A.
Steven Weber: Thanks, Will. We will now take your questions. Operator, please open the line.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We do have a question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. Good evening, guys. My first question is just on the B2B Scores business. I think the 10% growth felt a little bit light to us. So I was just hoping you could walk us through what that mix between price and volume was there, maybe versus the last quarter, even actually like you then missing the pricing element or the mix of your different lending categories in there.
William Lansing: Yeah. Manav, I don’t know that we’ve ever broken out the mix between the volume and the price. The volume was a little bit lighter, as you’d expect over a quarter like this one, so some of that was price.
Michael McLaughlin: And, Manav, I’ll just speak to – maybe give you a little more directional view on that. Look, we happen to report earnings after Equifax and TransUnion, also after Visa. And you can see some of the trends that would underlie our results in the B2B Scores business, particularly on the origination side from what they’re showing. Obviously, mortgage volumes were very, very strong. Auto volumes seem to be picking up, but for the quarter we’re down. And on the personal loan and credit card side of things, we’re seeing the same things that the bureaus saw in the period. Now, that bureau data also seems to suggest that the trend is improving, but there is certainly no assurance that that’s going to maintain itself. And, of course, when you look at the pricing across the 3 segments, I think you understand well the strategic pricing actions we took in the, what is our other category, credit cards, personal loans, and so forth. And that category suffered the worst in terms of volumes, but the pricing actions helped mitigate that.
Manav Patnaik: Okay, got it. That’s helpful. And then, just in the B2C side, I mean, that’s a pretty impressive number, is there any onetime deal activity in there, like you signed some new clients or so forth?
Michael McLaughlin: No, that’s a pretty clean number. We are genuinely seeing consumer interest in their credit score and how they can track it and improve it in this environment. And it’s showing both directly in myFICO.com and in our partner B2C sales.
Manav Patnaik: Got it? And then, maybe just one last question. Will, in your conversations with clients on the Software and even on the Scores side, are you starting to hear any kind of major budget issues where maybe you could see more delays on the Software side and maybe more pressure on the pricing side?
William Lansing: No, we really haven’t had that. I think things are moving a little bit more slowly than they have historically. I think there is this kind of additional care being taken with everything that our customers do. That said, they are full steam ahead on digital transformation, on upgrading their solutions. And we’re front and center there. So we really haven’t experienced slowness there.
Manav Patnaik: All right, thanks a lot.
Operator: We have a question from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Bill Warmington: Good evening, everyone.
William Lansing: Hi, Bill.
Michael McLaughlin: Hey, Bill.
Bill Warmington: So, Equifax – hey, guys. So Equifax and TransUnion both indicated improving results in June and July. And I know you guys are typically lagging those results by maybe 45 days. And so I wanted to see whether those improvements that they’re describing are showing up in your results. Did you see them in the June results? Are you seeing them in July?
William Lansing: We so – you’re absolutely right that our stuff lags them by roughly 6 weeks. We get some early indication and on basis of that, I’m pretty comfortable saying that our stuff will track theirs. But, again, it’s not final. These numbers aren’t final.
Bill Warmington: Got it. Also on the B2C, to follow up on Manav’s comments, that looks like a very strong quarter. TransUnion noted though, since they are a big supplier in the indirect space that they were a little concerned about the second half of the year, just because they were concerned that the aggregators are not seeing a lot of demand from the banks, meaning the banks are not very aggressive these days at trying to add new accounts. And so, I just wanted to touch-base on whether you felt comfortable with those volumes – with that level of growth continuing, because you can see the inside much better than we can, so.
William Lansing: Look, we’re pleased with the growth that we had and it’s always hard to forecast the future in an environment like this. The one thing that’s clear though is consumers are more focused, more interested in what’s going on with their credit score than they’ve ever been before. And we’re seeing it in myFICO. We’re seeing it in our partner consumer stuff. And so, I would hope that trend would continue. But again, we don’t know.
Bill Warmington: Yeah. How’s been the demand for UltraFICO and Experian Boost, how’s that been?
William Lansing: So Experian Boost is doing very well. And as you know, that’s – I mean, it’s boosting a FICO score and so there’s a benefit to FICO every time Boost happens. UltraFICO is lagging now, and largely because of the success that we’re having with Boost.
Bill Warmington: Got it? And I wanted to ask on the software side, you guys have been making some outsized investments in software now for some time. And I want to check in just to see whether you felt like the time was approaching when the rate of investment in software was going to start to slow.
William Lansing: I can’t make that promise, Bill. What I would tell you is that – what we’re seeing is tremendous appetite for our new solutions and our new Decision Management Platform, and deal size is getting bigger. And we now have banks that are adopting our solution, our Decision Management Platform solution, and then building all kinds of use cases on top of it. So we feel like we’re being vindicated in the strategic direction. At the same time, we – it does require investment. We continue to pour investment in. When will margins improve? There’ll be some margin improvement over time as we scale up our SaaS business and have more multi-tenant and returns to scale. So there’ll be some benefits there. And I think, professional services – as our products become simpler to install and a little bit easier, the proportion of professional services will go down, which will also be a margin improvement. So those are the factors but I can’t give you a timeline. I would tell you that we will continue to invest at this rate as long as it feels like those are smart decisions, like those are intelligent decisions given the appetite of the market for our staff.
Bill Warmington: You mentioned the banks adopting some of the DMS solutions and then building their own solutions on top of that. I know from time-to-time, you’ve talked about how you’ve developed your own – some of the new generations of your products are actually being built on the DMS platform and you use a lot of tools internally to do that. There was some talk about sometime over maybe the next 18 to 24 months, taking those tools and turning them outward, meaning that you’d have this whole ecosystem similar to salesforce.com or Workday, and having developers being able to develop customized tools on that platform. Does that – is that timeline still…
William Lansing: Yeah. That’s – we’re very focused on that. And this year, 2021, this coming year will be the year when our APIs are available on an outward basis, and borrowers and resellers and others will be able to build solutions on top of our platform, so that’s very much part of our strategy. It’s the way that we intend to reach other verticals besides financial services. It’s a way for us to go down market and basically solve the problem that we’ve always had, which is very limited distribution for extraordinary IP.
Bill Warmington: Yeah. Excellent. All right. I’ll yield the floor. Thank you very much for the insight.
William Lansing: Thanks, Bill.
Operator: We have a question from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Meuler: Yeah. Thanks. Sorry, if this is introductory, but I wasn’t aware of kind of Bill’s line of questioning about the 45-day lag. So I just want to make sure I’m understanding it correctly. So are you saying that you have not yet been paid for the credit pulls at the bureaus in June, because it’s not only that it’s reported to you like in arrears at the end of the month, but you’re actually paid kind of on a lagged basis and you recognize revenue on a lagged basis?
William Lansing: Mike, do you want to answer that?
Michael McLaughlin: Yeah. No, we don’t recognize revenue on a lag basis. We don’t get the final report for June until some period, days, not weeks, after the end of the quarter. But we take an accrual based for an estimated revenue that in conversations with those customers we determined is appropriate for the quarter. And historically, it’s very close and for revenue recognition purposes, it means that we’re able to batch revenue in the quarter with revenue recognized. Cash flow wise and billing wise, we have – we’re not going to go into our payment terms with individual customers on a call like this. But our payment terms with the bureaus are normal course and speed for a relationship like we have with them. But we do get those reports, so we – in arrears, as mentioned before. So we don’t know, we genuinely don’t know, what is happening in July at our bureau partners. We’ll know in a couple of weeks. Does that help?
Jeffrey Meuler: That’s helpful. Thank you. Yes, it does. And then just the expenses in the Scores business. What’s driving that, and I guess, was curious, if you’re leaning in more on marketing spend for myFICO, or if there’s a mix shift going on where you have some more expenses to the bureaus for like tri-merge premium, myFICO products or something?
Michael McLaughlin: So much of it is that we’re investing in the FICO Resilience Index. As Will mentioned briefly in his remarks, and maybe he wants to talk more about that. We haven’t dramatically increased marketing for the other parts of our business, but the development work, the outreach work and the implementation work around the Resilience Index, as well as other innovation steps that we’re taking in the Scores businesses, primarily what’s driving the increase you see there.
William Lansing: And then one small factor is that with myFICO as the volumes go up, our expense goes up, because we have a cost of goods sold in myFICO.
Jeffrey Meuler: Right, right. Got it. So I know that net revenue retention isn’t a common metric that you give. But just curious, if you can help us understand or size up the land and expand on the DMS platform solution? Like are there enough historical examples or time series where you can help us kind of understand? How big does the customer tend to come on as a new engagement for a DMS platform? And then, I don’t know, 2 or 3 years down the road, just how much more additional product or revenue are you generating off of them?
William Lansing: So what we’re – I mean, I would say it’s early days. And so it’s we don’t have a lot of data points around which to build a conclusion. That said, it looks really good. So what you have the situation where the very biggest banks, our biggest customers, absolute top tier banks, they have super complicated systems and they still buy some point solutions, and we have not yet had a top 10 bank stay to us, yeah, we’re adopting the FICO Decision Management Platform for all of our consumer facing decisioning. That hasn’t happened yet. However, it is happening with a tier down. And so, I would say, 2 years ago, we had some small banks that were doing it, and said, yeah, we’re going to standardize myFICO decisioning platform. And then we’re going to build all kinds of different credit decisions around that. And now we’re moving up market and so we have some pretty good-sized banks that have made the decision to adopt it. And sometimes it’s – they’ll start with a point solution they were in the market for and recognize the expansion opportunity. And sometimes, they do it very deliberately, with a view to putting a whole lot of different use cases on top of the platform once it’s been adopted. So the dog is eating the food, we’re pretty happy about the way it’s gone.
Jeffrey Meuler: All right. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question is from Kyle Peterson with Needham. Please go ahead.
Kyle Peterson: Hey, good evening, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to start on the decision management piece of the business. It seems like you’ve had some nice growth there for several of the last few quarters. Is the SaaS momentum kind of rolling strong enough where we can expect this growth to be able to continue? Or were there any like large chunky deals in there that we need to be mindful of? I just want to make sure we’re thinking about that piece of the business.
William Lansing: I think that is fair to think that the growth will continue. I mean, this is – it’s – obviously, the number is a little bit volatile, because it’s a smaller part of our business still. And so on a percentage basis, it can move quickly, because we’re dealing with smaller numbers. That said, there is – we have evermore solutions on top of the platform, it’s very much our future. It’s the way our salespeople are selling. It is the way the banks are buying it. And it is a very different world than it was 3 or 4 years ago. So while we still have sales of legacy product, and our legacy solutions will be around for a long time to come, because they’re best-in-class at what they do. The Decision Management Platform is really picking up steam.
Michael McLaughlin: And let me just add a little technical nuance for that. It’s a good question, because under the ASC 606 accounting rules. It can create some distortions in revenue when you sell an on-prem subscription product for 3, 5 years. That on-prem portion, in most cases, needs to be recognized all at once upfront, despite the fact that it’s a subscription. But if it’s a SaaS sale, it is recognized ratably as we bill and deliver it. So it can be lumpy for that reason alone, and not reflecting the underlying health of the business. Look, if there are big whoppers like that, that we’ve had to pull forward in any particular quarter, we’ll do our best to call those out. This quarter, it was a normal mix between the types of revenue recognition and sort of the growth is pretty normal.
Kyle Peterson: Great. That’s really good color. And then just a follow-up on the margins. Nice to see the upside there this quarter. And I mean, can appreciate the color you guys have provided in the slide deck on get some of the travel, entertainment and those types of expenses, which are obviously a bit lower right now. I just want to see have you guys – when – as we’ve gone through this kind of COVID process. Have you guys found any other expenses that you might be able to rationalize that might lead do some longer-term cost savings for whenever the world gets a little more…
William Lansing: Yeah. It’s a good question. We wrestle with it ourselves. I am – we’re of a view that some of these savings are here to stay. We don’t imagine that we’ll ever go back to the level of travel, we had before. I think that all of us not just like but our customers and our – everyone involved is now way more adept at using Zoom and doing more video. And what we’re finding is, we can have comparable, if not more contact with our customers with less travel. And so – and it’s obviously more efficient and a much lower cost. So I would imagine some of it’s going to survive in a post-COVID world. That said, it is unnaturally low right now. So you can expect it to go up from the level it’s at now, you can expect it to be lower than it was a year ago on an ongoing basis.
Kyle Peterson: Great. That’s very helpful. Thanks for taking the questions, and nice quarter, guys.
Operator: We have a question from Brett Huff with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.
Brett Huff: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had a quick question on the helpful chart that you guys put, I think it was Slide 3 or 4, where you had some red boxes and green boxes. Just want to make sure I understand the red boxes and that there’s some risk to those numbers. But it seems that the Scores boxes – the Scores number is 63 and 18, those seems like hittable targets and wondering, are those not green boxed, because they’re a little harder to predict? Or kind of what should we imply, given that it seems those might fall in the green box category?
William Lansing: I’d say it’s a little hard to predict. It’s a – call it, conservatism on our part, it’s a little harder to predict.
Brett Huff: Okay. That’s helpful. And then a quick update on the progress that you guys are making, which I know, it varies a little bit by product on the SaaS-ification of the products. I know you’ve got some already SaaS-ified, originations manager and et cetera. I know the Falcon and the update to TRIAD is coming out and/or near live. Can you just remind us of where we are in each of those products kind of coming out with the full GA SaaS product?
William Lansing: We’re more than halfway through the process if you look at our top franchises. So as you mentioned, originations manager is now on the platform, the new version of TRIAD, which we call Strategy Director is now on the platform. Blaze, our rules engine, is now on the platform called Decision Modeler. So we’re making progress there. There’s – I’d say, the 2 biggest ones that aren’t there yet are Falcon and debt manager. And those will be – those will take longer. I mean, Falcon, we’re working on it, we have another release coming very soon. But that’s a massive undertaking.
Brett Huff: And then last question is, the license revenue from Falcon was down quite a bit. I know some of that was from – I think it was down 66%. I think some of that was from the difficult comp. Is there any color you can give us that might be help us to kind of see the COVID impact rather than the tough comp impact? I’m not sure if you told us kind of what the numbers were on a year over year basis, if I go back to that script.
William Lansing: We don’t break out the volume part of it, but the volumes are down somewhat, a bit. But that’s part of it.
Brett Huff: Okay.
Michael McLaughlin: Yeah, and the vast majority of it was the renewal comp. We just had a couple of whoppers in the third quarter of last year, that all had to be recognized up front and those only happen once in a while and certainly not this quarter.
Brett Huff: Okay, great. That’s what I needed. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We have a question from Surinder Thind from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Surinder Thind: Thank you. Actually, a question about the Scores business, and just kind of following up on the earlier question about the volumes, generally, I mean, industry volumes that are kind of widely reported, whether it’s mortgage, auto or credit, they’ve generally been fairly good predictors of the Scores revenues. But based on kind of what I was calling incredible results that you guys, really good results that you guys posted this quarter, from my perspective, there seems to be a bit of a disconnect in some of the segments. And so, when I looked at like the mortgage volumes for industry, that was fairly consistent with what the bureaus reported, but then they reported auto and credit data that was much stronger than what the industry data would suggest. And do you have any color in terms of other types of activity that could have made up for that delta or any color there might be helpful? I mean, as an example, if I was to look at some of the bank data, their marketing activities, their credit card originations…
William Lansing: Yeah, I would say that that, I mean, in general, I don’t really have an answer for you. A narrow thing would be the fact that we do less lead gen than some of the bureaus, so you’ll see less there.
Surinder Thind: Okay, thank you. And then, another follow-up question, in terms of just the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force put up some recommendations a couple of weeks ago related to credit scoring. And one of the recommendations was that the credit scores being more inclusive of using alternative data which would suggest support for your newer scores, so FICO 9, FICO 10. And is there any potential revenue benefits from you guys, that you guys would experience if clients were to upgrade to, let’s say, the newest versions of the scores? Or are you somewhat agnostic as long as the clients continue to use FICO Scores.
William Lansing: I’d say it’s more of the latter. We’re agnostic. And we encourage people to move up to the latest and greatest scores, not because we charge more for them, but because we think they’ll get better results. And so, no, I wouldn’t say that there’s – don’t expect a revenue uptick as they migrate to newer scores, no.
Surinder Thind: That’s helpful. And then one other question in terms of – are you able to provide any color in terms of the percentage or revenue that maybe that’s in scores, that’s maybe less volume driven, that might be more relationship driven, such as like monitoring type of revenues or any color around ballpark figures that you might be able to provide?
William Lansing: I’m not sure I follow the question. I mean, all of our Scores revenue is driven at some level by volume and a little bit by price.
Surinder Thind: I guess what I was trying to get at was if we were to use just credit cards as an example, obviously, there is the origination volumes, there’s the marketing volume, but then there’s the monitoring piece. And so, I’m assuming monitoring would be more based on like the headcount that a certain bank would have. And so that would be less subject to, I guess, the COVID environment in the sense that they would want to continue to monitor all of their accounts.
William Lansing: Yeah, we see continued interest from our bank customers and monitoring closely. I mean, if anything, they’re more vigilant and more focused than ever.
Surinder Thind: Okay.
Michael McLaughlin: But maybe – to give you more, practically, those account management volumes, which is what we call them, are also based on the number of scores pulled. So there’s no real difference in the volume driver there for account management versus originations.
Surinder Thind: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time.
William Lansing: Thank you. This ends today’s call. Thank you all for joining and we look forward to speaking with you again soon.
Operator: That concludes the call for today. We thank you for your participation. I ask you to please disconnect your line.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-04-29 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the FICO Quarterly Earnings Call. I would now like to turn the conference over to Steve Weber. Please, go ahead.
Steve Weber: Thank you. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining FICO's Second Quarter Earnings Call. I'm Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations; and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike McLaughlin. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements may involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the Company's filings with the SEC, in particular, in the Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the Company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the Company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through April 29, 2021. And now, I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
Will Lansing: Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. First, I hope you and your families are healthy and staying safe as we go through this pandemic. As we all know, these are unprecedented time. No one can predict with any certainty the scale or length of disruption from COVID-19 or how severe the economic and health impacts will be. Many unknowns include the scope and effect of further public health responses as well as governmental, regulatory, fiscal and monetary policies. As we usually do, we've posted some slides with our results on the Investor Relations section of our website. I'll be referencing a few of those today during our presentation. Today, I'll go over the results for our second fiscal quarter and first half of the year, then I'll talk about how we're viewing our business in light of the current situation and how we plan to execute on a plan to remain strong, while preparing for the opportunities when this crisis ends. As we show on Slide 2, we've been successful in moving to a work-from-home structure and have not skipped a beat in how we serve the needs of our customers. In fact, nearly all of our 4,000 person global workforce are currently working from home. We responded early, closing our China offices in February, and we followed the lead of local state and national authorities and 43 offices and 32 different countries. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees who've responded to the quickly unfolding circumstances and have allowed us to adjust to ensure that key internal and client side deliverables remain on track. We were well prepared to move to this model. Over the last year, we've increased our usage of video based communications. Before the pandemic, it was a valuable tool to drive collaboration or reduce travel is now critical business practice. Our technology team had already built a robust VPN infrastructure that permits remote access to secured networks and servers. That infrastructure and our cloud-based solutions and support has meant that we are able to serve our customers without any significant loss of productivity, and as always, our cyber security team has been focused on protecting customers environments and sensitive data. It hasn't been easy. They're uncertain stressful times for everyone. But I'm proud of the business continuity efforts we've undertaken to prepare for potential issues, whatever they may be and how those efforts have paid extraordinary dividends as we are able to adapt to the challenge as we face. Finally, we've established an internal coronavirus response team. These are all examples of resilient culture of dedicated professionals are stepping up to the daily challenges we face. So, I'm pleased to report that we had a very strong second fiscal quarter. We reported revenues of 308 million, an increase of 11% over the same period last year. We delivered 58 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $1.94 per share. We delivered 64 million of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS of $2.14. This fact that we began to experience COVID related this -- in spite of the fact that we've begun to experience the COVID-related disruption in late March, we were able to generate 84 million in new bookings, which is impressive considering the most of our deals are closed at the end of the quarter right when businesses were closing, and everyone was transitioning to work from home. We continue to have a strong pipeline and believe many of our solutions are exactly what our customers are looking for as they focus on risk management. Our software revenue was up minus 3%, this quarter, applications were down 1%. As we had fewer up front license sales and less services revenue than last year. Decision Management software was up 20% with increases in both license sales and transactional revenue some fields we've signed previous quarters. In this course business, we had another great quarter due to special pricing that began to take effect. Total revenues were up 24% versus the prior year and total of 129 million. On the B2B side, revenues were up 27 over the same period as last year. B2C revenues were up 15% this quarter. Scores, particularly B2B is also an area of risk during volatile economic times, as some of those revenues are tied to things like origination of new loans. The strength of our business and our conservative financial practices have allowed us to build a healthy balance sheet. As you can see on Slide 4, we have ample liquidity and borrowing capacity. But as we look ahead, it's impossible to fully understand what the possible impacts to our markets will be and predict when the economy will improve. Because of these uncertainties, we are retracting our full year guidance. I'd like to direct you to Slide 5 to remind everyone what our original guidance was, where we stand now halfway through the year, and what we would need to do in the back half to achieve those original numbers. In this version currency this slide provides more details of our guidance than what we previously disclosed including more granularity around revenues. The red highlight areas of potential higher risk in the coming months. With B2B Scores, as I said, it's difficult for us to accurately forecast what will happen with volumes in the near term. Because these Scores are sold through bureaus that report to us in arrears, we don't have visibility to real-time data. In times of disruption, this is especially difficult until we can begin to see the trends in the data. We anecdotally know that, mortgage volumes have been strong and auto has been weak, but it's difficult to quantify what's happening today level on the next several months. Now on the software side, we have a great deal of visibility into our transactional and maintenance revenue streams. I believe those revenues to be very resilient. It's more difficult to estimate how many deals we'll be able to close and what potential impacts that would have on license and service revenue. We know that, we have a strong pipeline of deals and fully expect to close many of them, but there's clearly more uncertainty than there was a few months ago. We also believe that, we'll spend less-than originally planned. We will likely see savings in some revenue-based expenses and we'll spend less on travel and marketing and other discretionary areas. We're scrutinizing our expenses more than ever and we're committed to being as efficient as possible. In short, we don't know the severity or duration of disruptions in credit markets or technology purchases. Declines in Scores volumes will have a negative impact on our revenues despite the special pricing that we start to see this quarter, but it's difficult to know, for instance, if declines in auto sales now create a backlog of buyers in the fall or if it is part of a longer downturn. And while sales cycles for our solutions will likely be longer, we don't yet know how much is due to customers reassessing purchases versus the logistical challenges of remote selling. That said, we remain confident in our business model. We've got a great start to the year. We have a large amount of recurring revenue. While we expect our software revenues in the second half of the year to be lower than our guidance due to COVID-19, we also expect expenses to decline to primarily to reduce sales marketing expense and employee travel. These expense reductions will mitigate the impact on our bottom-line and we expect to have other operating expense savings due to general disruptions. So even though top line volatility is difficult to predict, we could still meet our original bottom-line guidance with a number of factors play off. These are exceptionally volatile times, but we remain optimistic and are actively managing the business to breach the short-term difficulties while building long-term value. I'll share some summary thoughts later, but now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike for further financial details.
Mike McLaughlin: Thanks, Will, and good afternoon everyone. As usual, I'll start with some detail around the revenue for Q2 fiscal '20. FICO's revenue for the quarter was $308 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year. Our application segments revenue were $140 million, down 1% versus the same period last year. The decrease in revenue was driven primarily by lower license and professional services revenue. Software applications bookings for the quarter were $48 million, down 24% from last year, due in large part to COVID-19 related disruptions and sales efforts at the end of March. In our Decision Management software segments, Q2 revenues were $39 million, up 20% over the same trade last year. This increase was primarily due to license and SaaS subscription revenues from our Decision Management platform products. Decision Management software bookings were $23 million Q2, down 17% from the previous year, similarly due to software sales disruptions at the end of the quarter. Finally, our Score segment revenues were $129 million, up 24% from the same period last year. B2B Scores revenue was up 27% over the same period last year and B2C revenues were up 15% from the same period. We do expect disruptions to Scores volumes, particularly on the B2B side as loan originations decline in some credit vertical. As Will said, Scores volumes are reported to us monthly in arrears, and so we did not have visibility into the Scores volumes real time. Turning to our global revenue mix. In our second fiscal quarter, 78% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region, our EMEA region generated 14%, and the remaining 8% was from the Asia Pacific region. Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources represent 78% of total revenues in the quarter consulting and implementation revenues were 16% and licensed revenues were 6% of the total. Revenues derived from our cloud delivered software as a service or SaaS products were 74 million for the quarter, which includes 58 million in transactional revenue and 17 million in professional services revenue. That's an increase of 12% from the previous year for our SaaS business. Total bookings, including our Scores segments for the quarter total a 4 million down 20% from last year, those bookings generated 12 million and current period revenues 14% yield. SaaS bookings were 31 million for the quarter, which was 6% from the previous year. Our operating expenses total 232 million in this quarter, down 14 million from the prior quarter due primarily to decreases in travel marketing and other discretionary expenses and the 3 million and restructuring costs in Q1 that did not recur in Q2. FICO's GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 25% and our non-GAAP operating margin as shown in our schedule, there's 32%. GAAP net income this quarter was 58 million up 75% from the prior year. Our non-GAAP net income was 64 million for the quarter of 36% from the same quarter last year. Our effective tax rate this quarter was about 7%, which included about 12 million of excess cash benefits, resulting from stock based compensation activities. We expect our effective tax rate to be around 10% to 12% for the full fiscal year. Free cash flow for the quarter was 55 million compared to 44 million in the same period last year. Free cash flow for the trailing four quarters was $259 million. t Turning to the balance sheet, at the end of quarter, we had $109 million in cash it was down 2 million from last quarter, primarily driven by share repurchases, partially offset by cash generated from operations. Our total debt face value is $959 million, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.44%, at the end of the quarter we had drawn 124 million on our $400 million revolving line of credit. We anticipate growing on that facility to pay for the $85 million maturities senior notes coming up in July. Our leverage ratio is calculated for our revolving line of credit was 2.25 times. As a reminder, our current covenant is 3.0 times and that covenant will expand to 3.25 when the most mature in July. Turning to return of capital, we bought back 290,000 shares in the second quarter for $96 million and an average price of $331 per share. At the end of March, we had about $64 million remaining on the board repurchase authorization. Finally, as Will said because of the uncertainty around COVID-19 and the impacts on the economic environment, we are withdrawing our previously issued financial guidance. With that I'll turn it back over to Will for some final comments.
Will Lansing: Okay. Work from home challenges. I'd like to end our prepared remarks today with some positive news. We're conducting a series of live webinars that we're calling building resiliency, adapting to the challenges of today. These webinars, which are almost virtual cycle world, began last week and continue through May 28. The topics falls in six tracks adaptability, digital customer engagement, risk management, operational efficiency, building trust and protecting customers. I'd encourage you to check it out information's available on our website and there are a number of keynote sessions that I think will be of interest to our investors, including one I'll be doing jointly with Equifax's CEO, Mark Begor, on May 14th. Finally, I'd like to thank all of you for joining us today. These are challenging times, but I'm convinced we're up to the challenge. We can't control the external factors we face, but we can control how we respond and plan for the future. We're stewards of remarkable assets and we remain optimistic as we look to the future. We'll bridge this period of disruption as we have in the past and will emerge as place for growth. I'll be as transparent as possible as we work through this uncertainty and will provide guidance as soon as we have better understand the economics and commercial environment. So, I'll now turn it back to Steve for Q& A.
Steve Weber: Thanks Will. We are now ready to take your questions. So, operator, please open the lines.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Manav Patnaik: I was just curious, if you could talk to us about the volume trends that you saw in the quarter in the -- if I understand, you can't see what's happening beyond that, but maybe what that growth was in the quarter and maybe how it looks like in my choices prior to Mike?
Will Lansing: You're talking about B2C, Manav?
Manav Patnaik: No, B2B.
Will Lansing: B2B, Mike, I don't know if you have the details on that.
Mike McLaughlin: Yes. So, the big three buckets of volumes in that part of our business as you know are, the mortgage business, the auto business and then credit cards, personal loans that we call the other segment. Mortgages were up, as you would expect given some of the refi dynamics that have been in place for a number of months. And in the auto and other segments, the volume changes were, on a year-over-year basis were in the single-digit percentages, so not really anything to write all about there. With respect to the end of the quarter, the impact was close enough to the end of March, which is the last reports we have from our partners at the bureau. So, we did not see anything informative from those volumes at the end of March. Frankly what you heard from the bureaus in their quarterly reports over the last a week or number of days, have more real time information that we have on that front.
Manav Patnaik: Got it. And maybe just on the B2C business as well, I mean, your mix of business that has changed over the years. Do you anticipate that to be countercyclical or how should we think about that?
Mike McLaughlin: So far, it's holding up nicely and with respect to myFICO for example, it's up. It's not surprising consumer is very focused on their credit if it's kind of a time.
Manav Patnaik: Okay. And then just last one if I can squeeze it in. You talked about in a strong visibility on your transaction on the incident side of the software. So, I was just curious if you could just give a little bit color on what you're seeing from the customers? I mean, has that decelerated? Is that being just pushed out much later like any talk?
Mike McLaughlin: Yes. It is being pushed out. So remember, we have a very long sales cycle, 250 day sales cycle. So, we had a lot of stuff that was in process that was closer to the end and to the beginning of the process and so that's something that pushed the next quarter, some of it got close. But they haven't been hit in the way they were back in 2007, 2008. It says this is a different kind of a situation, as and so we haven't seen them pulling back on their investment plans, at least not so far. Now, it would, it probably would be naive to believe that everything will be business as usual, and I'm sure on the margin, there'll be some business that we were hoping for that won't happen. But, but we haven't seen tremendous changes in behavior other than the timeline for getting transactions done slowing down a little bit.
Operator: The next question is from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Bill Warmington: So, I wanted to ask, if you could talk a little bit about what the revenue exposure is in Scores for those three buckets, credit card, mortgage and auto, that would be for the and I think for the B2B side?
Will Lansing: Bill, I think, as Mike mentioned a minute ago, I think broadly we can mortgage looks like it's going to be up, auto looks like it's going to be way down, credit cards and personal loans down, but I think you probably do better reading into the numbers that you see from the Bureau's then asking us to speculate because we don't have it.
Bill Warmington: How does, I appreciate that in terms of the volumes, but once we once we get a sense of the volumes, then we have to map it to the FICO B2B revenue, and I was asking for some help in terms of how big is credit card as a percentage of revenue these days. How big is mortgage, how big is auto, how does that break down across the Scores B2B universe?
Will Lansing: Mike, do you have those percentages? I don't know if you have any handy?
Mike McLaughlin: Yes, Bill, we haven't shared those in the past. I don't think this is the forum to change that disclosure practice. But I guess I can say that it hasn't changed materially at least to the end of March to what we had in the past in the past four years.
Bill Warmington: I don't know if they're working or not, but they're out there. All right, well then when you guys are talking about, you've made some references to margins and how there's some natural reduction in expenses going along with revenue and T&E reduction freezing hiring and so on. Is a thought to try to preserve the margin that was implied in the original guidance, which looks like it was around 30% to 33% EBITDA, that's adjusted EBITDA level around 30% operating margin? Is that that the thought that to try to, if it is lower revenue to try and preserve that margin percentage or your thought is to try to actually raise that margin percentage to offset the decline and deliver the same level of EPS?
Will Lansing: I think, Bill, you expect it will take every step is within our power to manage our expenses to maximize the margin. So, while we don't have complete control over the top line, we obviously have a little more control over the bottom line. And so I would hope that we could do better than preserving the rate. But again, if you look at the slide in our deck, we basically laid out what would happen have to be true for us to hit the prior guidance.
Bill Warmington: Correct. Okay. And then just one in the context of expenses, I wanted to ask about your plans for continued investment in the software business and how that's going. You had mentioned, when you gave the original guidance, you talked about some opportunities for increased efficiency within the software business. I want to see how that's all, how you're weighing all that now?
Will Lansing: Well, as the impact COVID has been on our company, we were engaged in and continue to be engaged in a really extensive review of every activity that we have going on in the Company, and our goal is to really focus on things that are truly strategic and to de-emphasize things that are less strategic. And that initiative, that work proceed the pace that it has not been slowed at least by COVID. I think if anything, we're more committed than ever to getting as as much of our capability onto the platform as quickly as possible so we can start to see the returns to scale that we're all looking for. So, I would say that, our investments plans on a strategic and platform stuff completely unchanged. If anything, we're looking for ways to free up resources to put even more against it. But then things that are off-platform, off-strategy, we're scrutinizing those barriers.
Bill Warmington: Then last one from me, I wanted to ask about, the FICO Resilience Index. It sounds like an interesting product. It looks like you're -- maybe you could talk a little bit about what the plan is for that one in terms of the rollout. It looks like Equifax is the only one right now doing a test with it, but how soon do you think that's going to, before that actually starts to generate some revenue? How big could it be?
Will Lansing: We think it's going to be very big. It's not going to generate any revenue in the near-term, because our plan is to provide it for free along with FICO Scores. So if you buy a FICO Score, you can also get the FICO Resiliency Index along with it. We think that, there is commensurate, maybe worth spending just a minute on what it is. This is some really smart stuff that our guys came up with. That helps us to differentiate amongst consumers and evaluate their credit within any particular FICO Score, that's at a point in time and at a point in the economic cycle. And there are individuals who are more resilient and they're individuals who are less resilient. And the traditional way of dealing with downturns and we see it today is that, lenders, raise their lending thresholds. They raised their cutoff, and while obviously that's a prudent thing to do, we'd love for that to be a little more sophisticated and surgical and be able to evaluate some of the individuals below those cutoffs and with more precision. And that's really what the FICO Resiliency Index does. It'll be bundled with the FICO Score. It will be widely available to anyone who's buying FICO Scores. It is currently in test, as you said with Equifax and the Dow. Experian will have it out too. TU should follow. And yes, we have high expectations because it's been very well received to-date.
Operator: And we have question from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Please go ahead.
Jeff Meuler: Yes, thank you. Just within the software businesses. I understand that bookings are going to be impacted, which can impact revenue, license revenue, professional services. But in terms of client usage, I think there was a mention of collections and recovery. I'm guessing that's because of some collections hiatuses, but seeing some negative impacts there, but just what are you seeing across the different software businesses any kind of positives or negatives for the different products to call out?
Will Lansing: We were seeing more in CCS and customer communication that's up a bit because the lenders are engaged in a lot more back and forth with their consumer customers than they have been in the past. So, that does a little the others, not tremendously different investment and we're not saying dudes proportional or anything.
Jeff Meuler: And then within the to be Scores, how much of it is tied to, I guess origination or marketing type volumes and how much of it is stickier or account management or open access programs have Scores in terms of B2B revenue mix?
Will Lansing: We don't we don't break it out, we don't break it out. I think it's fair to assume that there'll be a little less origination activity. I mean, that's not unreasonable.
Jeff Meuler: Okay, and then there was two comments, as you were talking about the special pricing, one was began to take effect and then started to see just any sense of roughly how much of the special pricing was the benefit was felt this quarter versus yet to be further than?
Will Lansing: We would have felt it. Yes, it's come in.
Operator: We have a question from Brett Huff with Stephens. Please go ahead.
Brett Huff: Question to follow up on, what I thought was an interesting comment you made about on bank health. And well, I think you phrased it, the banks weren't hit, aren't hit yet as hard or aren't as hard as maybe the great recession just given this isn't bank led. A lot of our clients are trying to suss out kind of how banks are reacting. So, can you just flush out that a little bit more, I think you mentioned that you haven't seen any major changes in investments, but kind of what is their attitude as you talk to them about what their game plan is and how you can help them?
Will Lansing: Well, I think that they're much better prepared than the last time their balance sheets are stronger. They have more capital on hand. They, learn the last time around, and I also think that the government and the fed has jumped in a way that very quickly in a way that they didn't the last time around to ponder and so I think it's those kinds of things. And as you can see from their public statements, if you really if you look at the public statements from the big bank CEOs, they're, they're obviously planning to weather this much better than the last time around.
Brett Huff: That's helpful in any particular products that piqued my interest in the last six weeks. I'm assuming maybe collections or something like that, but anything that has kind of sparked spiked up given the changes in the in the outlook.
Will Lansing: Since, as I mentioned earlier there's more usage of our customer communication services, which is the last mile to customer consumer, customer contacts, that those volumes are up. Remember loan sales cycle and so you wouldn't see things change quickly. The things that are in place, we're seeing more volume in places you'd expect like that, like they see CCS. But otherwise, we're not and then we're expecting with all the transaction volume down, credit card transaction volume down. It may have an impact on Falcon volumes. But, most of our Falcon business is priced by account. And so, I'm not sure how much impact it was really have on us.
Brett Huff: Okay. Thank you for that. Last question from me is, one of the things that a lot of folks have been asking us is kind of all the value proposition that the FICO Score continues to provide, and even at higher prices, we're of the opinion that it's still one of the best deals going in risk management and portfolio management. Any conversations, I don't know how much you can talk about banks, but what is the, any added views on how does that value play out in uncertain situation like this for banks? Do they perceive it differently? Are they looking to buy differently, buy it more cetera for that risk management in a situation like this?
Will Lansing: So, the answer is yes. We strongly believe that, it's a tremendous tool. FICO is tremendous tool for evaluating credit worthiness and more needed, more necessary, more in demand than ever in times like these. The Resiliency Index that I mentioned earlier is tied up in that. And so, the way we think about it, we are constantly innovating and trying to find ways to bring evermore sophistication to that evaluation to that decision and that's worked out pretty well. Will they be pulling account management support more frequently in these times, to be determined? We'll see. We'll see. It wouldn't be a shock.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we have a question from Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Surinder Thind: Good afternoon. Will, I'd like to start with a question on the discourse business. Can you talk a little bit about the strength in the B2C segment? There is a little bit of a color on it earlier, but a double-digit growth at this point seems really strong and how should we think about the consumer in this environment and then maybe even from a competitive perspective in the sense that, there are perhaps other competing services out there, that are also trying to at least mimic, providing consumers support type information for free.
Will Lansing: Yes. I mean that's been going on for years. There are players out there who provide non-FICO Scores to consumers to help them, to give them a sense for what their credit worthiness. But since lenders predominantly use FICO Scores, there's a mismatch there. Consumers are sometimes confused, but we've been working for a long time. I'm trying to clear up that confusion and make sure that consumers understand that, a credit score is not a FICO Score unless it's a FICO score. And that, what they are trying -- what the consumer trying to understand is, what the lender thinks of them? What the lender's evaluation of their credit worthiness is than the FICO Scores a way to do it, we have arrangement with Experian, our partner where Experian provides FICO Scores to the consumers and their consumer offerings. We offer obviously FICO Scores in our own consumer offering in myFICO. We think that there's more appetite and interest in that than ever. Just kind of given the situation, people are concerned about their credit. And so, we feel pretty good about that business is tied to the origination of credit cards in the sense that there's a time there that'll slow that down.
Surinder Thind: And then in terms of any color on -- is Experian the primary source of the B2C revenues or is myFICO a considerable percentage as well?
Will Lansing: Experian is bigger than myFICO. It's a -- revenues experience -- no, myFICO is a good business too, a good-sized business, too. I don't think we break out the specifics of it, but experience is also very important to that business.
Surinder Thind: And then in terms of just a big picture question for the Scores business, obviously, it is a very transaction driven business. Is there consideration to maybe moving more towards the licensing model just to reduce some of the volatility? Or is there an appetite from that from clients? Or is there any kind of discussions? Obviously, I think it was last quarter I believe that there was a big licensing deal, any colors or thoughts that you might be having with clients especially maybe in the current environment around something like this?
Will Lansing: Most of our Scores businesses is price per Score.
Surinder Thind: Understood, meaning that from your guidance perspective, from a strategy perspective, the desire for you guys to go more towards a licensing model?
Will Lansing: Well, we're pretty happy with the model that we have. I don't know that we're looking to modify it.
Surinder Thind: Understood, and then moving towards the software business. Can you talk a little bit about the applications business versus DMS, maybe the idea being that, how should we maybe think about the mix of sales on a go forward basis? Is the sales force being incentivized to maybe sell DMS over applications? Or I know in the past times you guys have talked about that you're agnostic, but obviously DMS is the platform of the future, right?
Will Lansing: Right, we have historically paid a little bit extra attention to from a sales force perspective to selling DMS base products. But at the end of the day, we sell to our customers what they need, and with the DMS base, fantastic; and if it's not, then so be it, we'll do it that way. So -- and we compensate our sales people regardless of what it is they sell. I think your points well taken though, and as we think into the future, we likely will favor DMS sales over non-DMS sales. So, that I think that is a, that's a piece of business to really watch, that's the future.
Surinder Thind: And then maybe turning to expenses, I mean, obviously, given the strength your cash flows, the balance sheet as a firm. I mean, do you really have to think about playing defense in the current environment? And I got the sense that you guys were obviously watching the expenses carefully. Obviously, that that's good to do at any point in time, but how should we just think about your overall expense allocation at this point or investment versus maybe what it would be under normalized conditions? How much of a difference are you guys kind of seeing? Obviously, there's a natural component to it, meaning obviously, the less travel is marketing type stuff, but just any color there would be helpful?
Will Lansing: If you're asking about COVID, specific kind of implications that you just mentioned them, it's things like travel, and it's the fact that when revenues lower, we have less expenses associated with servicing that revenue. So, that part is for sure. I wouldn't say that, we're in a place where suddenly because of COVID our backs are to the wall and we have to rethink our entire expense structure. I think we're doing the thing that management always does, which is reviewing whether every dollar is well spent and we are engaged in that process and continue to be engaged in that process. But I wouldn't call it an emergency or a response to COVID. I think just running the business.
Surinder Thind: Okay, understood. That was actually my point that, that you guys really do have a strong cash flow and balance sheet so you don't perhaps need to be as defensive as maybe other organizations are.
Will Lansing: Absolutely.
Surinder Thind: And then I guess turning to, I guess the question being in terms of just, when I look at the personal expenses, head counts up year-over-year but the personnel costs are down. Is that mostly like variable conflict that delta there? Or how should we be thinking about that difference?
Will Lansing: Mike, do you want to take that?
Mike McLaughlin: It's two things, so as you may recall, we had a restructuring expense last quarter, a part of that was to reduce head count. And so, there's some of that. And then also we accrued throughout the year, yearend incentive bonuses, both cash and stock-based, based on certain expected outcome and that outcome exceeded or underperformed. And rate at which we accrue the yearend does have an impact on that period-to-period labor costs. The big picture though is that, head count is essentially flat. I think it's up 0.5% versus where we were last quarter, and there's nothing significant going on in terms of the mix of compensation or the rate of change of compensation per person.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time.
A - Steve Weber: Thank you. Thank you everyone for joining today's call. We look forward to talking with you again soon. Stay safe and healthy and thank you again.
Operator: That concludes the call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you to disconnect your lines.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-01-30 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Fair Isaac Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Thursday, January 30, 2020. I would now like to turn the conference over to Steve Weber. Please, go ahead.
Steve Weber: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining FICO's first quarter earnings call. I'm Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations; and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike McLaughlin. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular, in the Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today, for a reconciliation of each of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through January 30, 2021. And now, I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
Will Lansing: Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. I'd say we're off to a good start, delivering growth across our portfolio and also delivering innovation. In our first quarter, we reported revenues of $299 million, an increase of 14% over the same period last year. We delivered $55 million of GAAP net income, up 37%; and GAAP earnings of $1.82, up 38%. On a non-GAAP basis, the $1.80 earnings per share was up 24% from last year. And we delivered free cash flow growth as well, up 27% from fiscal 2019. On the software side of our business, the innovation we're bringing to market is gaining traction among companies eager to use analytics-driven decisioning to solve their most difficult problems. At FICO World in November, we hosted more than 1,400 attendees, representing 600 companies from 62 countries. During the conference, our solution specialists held close to 1,100 consultations. We sat down with customers and potential customers to understand their business issues and explain and demonstrate how FICO's advanced analytics, digital decisioning and dynamic workflows can transform their business. The innovation on display at FICO World continues to translate into robust sales in our software business. We had another good bookings quarter at $112 million. The $49 million of DMS bookings was the second largest quarter, after last quarter's $61 million, in FICO's history. That means we've booked about $110 million in DMS business in the last two quarters. I'm convinced we're developing software at the same time demand is emerging for analytic-based decisioning software. In our Scores business, we had another good quarter. Scores were up 34% in the quarter versus the prior year. On the B2B side, revenues were up 46% over the prior year. Our B2C revenues were up 11% versus the first quarter of 2019. We continue to see strength throughout the Scores marketplace. We also announced some innovations in our Scores business, the release of the FICO Score 10 Suite. The suite has two new scores. FICO Score 10 relies on credit bureau data and is consistent with previous FICO Score versions that are in the market today. It reflects a normal model development cadence, extending features that were introduced in FICO Score 8 and FICO Score 9. FICO Score 10 is designed to be backward-compatible with previous Score versions. FICO Score 10T incorporates a broader set of credit bureau data, including trended data, which captures unique aspects of the consumer's financial profile over time. While the blueprint design is similar, it uses new characteristics to enhance predictive power. Both FICO Score 10 and FICO Score 10T demonstrate greater predictive power over all previous versions of the FICO Score and were developed on recent data sets. By adopting the FICO Score 10 Suite, a lender can reduce the number of defaults in its portfolio by as much as 10% among newly originated bank cards, 9% among newly originated auto loans compared to using FICO Score 9. The reduction in default is even higher for newly originated mortgage loans at 17% compared to the version of the FICO Score used in that industry. These improvements in predictive power can help lenders safely avoid unexpected credit risk and better control default rates, while making more competitive credit offers to more consumers. We believe this type of innovation, which we've developed with significant feedback from the lending community, will significantly increase performance and allow the industry to expand loans and revenue, while not increasing losses. We will continue to update you on this and other score innovations that we'll announce in the coming months. I'll talk more about how we see the year playing out, but first, I'll turn the call over to Mike for further financial details.
Mike McLaughlin: Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. FICO's total revenue for the quarter was $299 million dollars, an increase of 14% over the prior year. Breaking that down into our reported segments, our applications revenues were $152 million, up 3% from the same period last year. This increase in revenue was driven by higher professional services revenues as well as higher usage-based software revenues. Software applications bookings for the quarter were $56 million, down 6% from last year. In our Decision Management Software segment, Q1 revenues were $31 million, up 8% over the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to services and usage-based revenues in our Decision Management platform. DMS bookings were $49 million in Q1, up 56% from the previous year, which, as Will pointed out, is the second highest booking quarter in this segment's history at FICO. Finally, our Scores segment revenues were $115 million, up 34% from the same period last year. The B2B portion of our Scores segment was up 46% over the same period last year. And B2C revenues were up 11% -- B2C revenues were up 11% from last year. We had strong volumes throughout the Scores vertical and also signed an annual licensing deal worth several million dollars that was all recognized in the first quarter due to the new ASC 606 accounting rules. In our first quarter, 76% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region. Our EMEA region generated 16%, and the remaining 8% was from Asia Pacific. Looking at our revenue by type for the quarter. Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources represented 74% of total revenues. Consulting and implementation revenues were 15% of total revenues, and software license revenues were 11% of the total. Revenues derived from our cloud-delivered software-as-a-service products were $74 million for the quarter, which included $57 million in transactional software revenues and $17 million in professional services, an increase of 16% from the previous year in total. Bookings for the quarter totaled $112 million, up 5% from last year. These bookings generated $16 million of current period revenue, a 14% yield. SaaS bookings were $37 million for the quarter, down 16% from the previous year. Our operating expenses totaled $247 million in this quarter, up $11 million from the prior quarter; due primarily to expenses associated with FICO World in November and increased personnel costs. We also incurred about $3 million in restructuring costs related to headcount reduction actions taken during the first quarter. Our non-GAAP operating margin, as shown in our Reg G schedule, was 27% for the quarter. GAAP net income this quarter was $55 million, up 37% from the prior year. Our non-GAAP net income was $54 million for the quarter, up 23% from the same quarter last year. As you will see from our non-GAAP reconciliation, we had a large reduction to income tax expense this quarter of $22 million or $0.73 per share associated with excess tax benefits, resulting from stock-based compensation activities. This left us with an effective tax rate of negative 31%. As we said last quarter, we expect our effective tax rate, inclusive of excess tax benefits, to be around 16% to 17% for the fiscal year. FICO's free cash flow for the quarter was $54 million compared to $42 million in the same period last year. Free cash flow for the trailing four quarters was $248 million. Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had $111 million in cash. This is up $5 million from last quarter due to cash generated from ops, partially offset by $60 million in share repurchases. Our total debt face value today is at $930 million, including $95 million outstanding on our revolving line of credit. Our debt has a weighted average interest rate of 4.57%. During the quarter, we issued $350 million of callable notes, which will mature in 2028. The fixed rate on those new notes is 4%. Proceeds of the notes were used to repay a portion of the revolving credit facility. We anticipate drawing on the revolving credit facility to pay for the $85 million maturity of senior notes that is coming due in July. And turning to return of capital. We bought back 168,000 shares in the first quarter at an average price of $356 per share. Total cash used for buybacks, as I mentioned, in the quarter, was $60 million. At the end of December quarter, we had about $160 million remaining on the board repurchase authorization. And finally, we are confirming our previously issued full year financial guidance for fiscal 2020. With that, I'll turn it back over to Will for his thoughts on FY 2020.
Will Lansing: Thanks, Mike. As I said in my opening remarks, I believe we're well positioned for success as we move into 2020 and beyond. Our Scores business continues to excel, and we work hard to get feedback from lenders and regulators to make sure we provide analytics to protect the safety and soundness of lending decisions. On the software side, we're producing higher bookings and building a backlog of recurring transactional revenue. We continue to look for innovative ways to serve our customers and improve efficiency in our business. We do all of it with an eye toward building shareholder value. I'll now turn the call back over to Steve for Q&A.
Steve Weber: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now take your questions. Operator, please open the lines.
Operator: Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] One moment please for our first question, and it comes from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Bill Warmington: Good evening, everyone.
Will Lansing: Hey, Bill.
Bill Warmington: So the first question I wanted to ask was about the strong license revenue on the Scores side of the business. You normally don't see a lot of license revenue in Scores, and just want to ask for some detail on that?
Will Lansing: Bill, I wouldn't read too, too much into it. It was – we did one larger deal and the way it was structured was as a license, and so we got a disproportionate pop there, but I would not read all too much into that.
Bill Warmington: Okay. And then on the Scores business, you guys have talked about special price increases. We've seen a couple over the past two years in mortgage and in auto. Have you guys put through a special price increase in January? And if so, maybe you could talk a little bit about it?
Will Lansing: Yes, we have. And it's just gone into effect, and so we really haven't had an opportunity to read the results yet.
Bill Warmington: Okay. Are you feeling good about it so far?
Will Lansing: Well, I always feel good about our business.
Bill Warmington: Is it perhaps in the credit card portion of the business?
Will Lansing: Some credit card is affected, yes.
Bill Warmington: Okay. Okay. Switching over to the software part of the business. Today, all of your APIs are inward facing, meaning that your internal developers are using those tools to build applications on the DMS platform. Is the plan to make those APIs available externally? And if so, what kind of time frame?
Will Lansing: Bill, that is a great question. A lot of insight in that question. We very much plan to turn our APIs so that they're outward-facing, eventually. That's probably, realistically, an 18 to 24-month time frame before we can do that. The advantage of it, the strategy behind it is, as you know, we're taking our solutions, which are mostly financial services-oriented, we're getting them onto the platforms that we have multi-tenant, standardized, highly configurable solutions with real returns to scale. When we can turn the APIs outward, a bunch of good things happen. First, we can enlist partners to do customization beyond the API so that it's not our job. It becomes that of VARs and resellers and others who help us to get that done. Second, we'll be able to move into verticals beyond financial services, where we don't have a sales force but where there's an appetite. And I would say that's true for all B2C companies. Any B2C company that wants to get into data-driven decisioning and optimizing their consumer interactions, which tend to benefit from [Technical Difficulty] platform. The outward-facing APIs will let them have vertical custom kinds of solutions based on our platform. But it's very much our strategy. Frankly, it's an inflection point for our software business when we achieve that.
Bill Warmington: And then I just wanted to ask a question on the SaaS bookings, on the $37 million, that those were down on a year-over-year basis. Is that CCS impact? Or is something else impacting that?
Mike McLaughlin: Bill, it's Mike. There's nothing particularly noteworthy in terms of where that shortfall is relative to typical bookings pattern. It's a reflection of the fact that bookings are relatively lumpy in our business and this is our seasonally slowest quarter in terms of bookings. As you know, it's typically kind of high-teens to 20% of full year bookings that come in, in the first quarter. So if you combine a relatively lumpy business, i.e., lots of large deals with the smallest sample set being the lowest seasonal quarter, just the chances for an aberration that doesn't have sort of long-term statistical significance is high. And that's how you should think about this. We continue to feel good about how that business is growing in terms of external demand and booking pipeline. So I think it's a -- I think it's just a one-off this quarter.
Bill Warmington: Yes. And then last question for me, if I could. The FICO 10 and the FICO 10T, your thoughts on when the GSEs are going to actually adopt those?
Will Lansing: Boy, that's a little hard to say. We certainly expect these courses to be in the consideration set.
Bill Warmington: All right. Well thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is...
Manav Patnaik: Thank you, good evening guys. Just to follow-up on the Scores pricing, I know you said some card and you did something in January. But is the mortgage and auto pieces that you did in the prior two years, are those fully cycled through, or is there incremental opportunities there still there?
Will Lansing: I think you should think of them as being fully cycled through, to use your words. It's been in place for a while now.
Manav Patnaik: Okay. And then just, I guess, on the B2C side, I mean, that was some -- 11% was a pretty good number. Are there -- is it pretty broadly diversified? Or is that your experience in relationship? I was just hoping you could give us some more color on the trends you're seeing there?
Mike McLaughlin: Yes, it's broadly diversified, Manav. There's again, nothing that really sticks its head up as being -- as a single explanation. But it's both our own platform and the third-party relationships we have.
Manav Patnaik: Got it. And then just, Mike, maybe on the margin front, hoping maybe if you could just help us with the moving pieces there like how much of it was maybe the FICO World impact to your point, timing and lumpiness in software, obviously, can be all over the place. How should we think about the progression through the course of the year?
Mike McLaughlin: Yes. So we talked at the end of last quarter about 2020 being a year where we're going to begin to focus on turning the margins more favorable. In this quarter, we took a relatively small restructuring charge associated with headcount reduction. Most of the financial impact of that won't be realized -- financial benefit from that won't be realized until the second quarter and beyond. But we do expect that benefit to materialize. In the first quarter, we also had FICO World and of course that restructuring expense itself. And if you take those out, probably 4% of our expense growth on an OpEx basis was due to those things. And so we're still growing OpEx at a rate that is double-digit, but lower than income -- lower than revenue growth. We expect as the year progresses, as we gain some more efficiencies and focus more on cost that the operating leverage, the difference between revenue growth and expense growth will be greater than that. But you're not seeing much of it yet in the first quarter.
Manav Patnaik: Okay. Got it. Thank you guys.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open.
Jeff Meuler: Yeah. Thank you. Can you just remind me, it's the company's typical methodology to adjust the full year guidance as warranted past second quarter for special pricing as a bit more time has passed, we shouldn't read anything into just maintaining this guidance in terms of the implementation of how the special pricing as the implementation is going on that front, correct?
Will Lansing: We don't really have a schedule for adjusting guidance. The guidance that we give at any point in time is our best estimate of where we're going to be. And so the guidance that we have in place is what we believe to be the guidance.
Jeff Meuler: Okay. And then can you just help me on the application, transaction and maintenance performance in the quarter? It was pretty muted growth, the lowest year-over-year it's been in a while. Just anything about end market transaction activity, timing factors, just any reason why there would be slower growth there?
Will Lansing: I think that, the best way to think about it is it's by design. We are – if you take a step back and you look at the transition that we're making from license on-premise, software business, which was what we were historically and predominantly, and the transition to our future state of multi-tenant, standardized, configurable platform business, there's an in-between stage. And the in-between stage, which is strategically impure, but important competitively, is to be able to provide our solutions in the cloud, even if they're single tenant hosted, even if they're not the end-state software platform that we'd like them to be. And so we are in a migration pattern here, where three of our top five franchises, we've moved to the platform. Two of our top five have not yet moved to the platform. And yet we're not willing to abandon our customer's needs for having some of those solutions in the cloud. And so what we do is we take that business even though it's lower margin business, because we think it's strategic. We want to keep competitors out. We want to satisfy our customers. But the returns to scale really come when those solutions are fully migrated over to the standardized multi-tenant platform. So, the balance we strike in our software business is that there is more business available in this in between space than we care to do. And so we basically – we basically meet the demand that we think is appropriate to meet our strategic customer needs without overdoing it. And that's really how we think about that, call it, a lower revenue growth rate in the short-term.
Jeff Meuler: Got it. And then just last, you've had a competitor call out some, I guess, bookings delays in the U.K. just given the macro concerns, Brexit concerns. Just any comment on, if you're seeing something similar or how the U.K. is going for you? Thanks.
Will Lansing: Not really. Our EMEA business, our U.K. business is fine.
Jeff Meuler: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Surinder Thind: Good afternoon. I'd like to start a question about the FICO Score 10 Suite. Can you talk a little bit about the benefit of providing the FICO 10 Score versus the 10T in the sense that at face value, obviously, 10T comes across as a superior score, but then it sounds like FICO 10T was – or FICO 10 was introduced for backwards compatibility? Is that the primary way that clients will be thinking about it? And how should we be thinking about the reason why it's important?
Will Lansing: Yeah, I think that's – that's a good characterization of the difference. So, we have – the goal is always to have a more predictive score and to help lenders make better decisions. We have a kind of a regular cadence of updating our scores every several years. And so FICO Score 10 is right on-time for the update from FICO 9. It is completely backward-compatible. So it's the same reason codes, and although the weighting of some of the factors is different, it can be used interchangeably in some sense with FICO 9. With FICO 10T, we're using different data sets, the trended data, and we've introduced some additional reason codes. And what that does is it makes it not so backwards-compatible, but it does provide better predictiveness for certain kinds of things. So that's the right way to think about it is backward compatibility versus not.
Surinder Thind: Understood, and then, from a -- generally, from a client perspective, how much more, I'll say, effort would be involved, in going to FICO 10T? Because, I assume that will become the new paradigm in terms of -- like you wouldn't have another -- let's say the next-generation without a completely different set of FICO Scores. Because I think you'd obviously want to maintain further compatibility from 10T and beyond, I assume. And so...
Will Lansing: Every lender is different and what you see is different, lenders have different adoption rates for new scores. We still have FICO 9, out there. Obviously, we have FICO 8. We have earlier scores that are still very much in use. And still work just fine. So it's up to the lender to decide at what pace they want to change the scores that they use. Obviously, Fintechs and startups and brand-new customers gravitate to the latest and greatest, which would be 10 and 10T.
Surinder Thind: That's helpful. And then, touching base on an earlier topic about the software revenues, I think you characterized them as, there's some natural volatility. And this quarter, in particular, tends to be the lightest of here. Can you also talk a little bit about perhaps -- and I just want to verify or at least the color that you were providing around. When we think about software margins for the year, is the goal there to keep them essentially flat year-over-year? Or how should we just think about that versus the overall firm-wide margins?
Will Lansing: I think flat is safe. We take it as we go here. We're -- right now, we're trying to focus on matching expenses and revenue growth, so that we don't have big changes in margin one way or the other. Maybe we'll do a little better than that, maybe a little bit worse. That depends on kind of how the factors in the year shake out.
Surinder Thind: And I apologize for -- is that at the firm-wide level or is that at the software level? Sorry.
Mike McLaughlin: That's at the software level. Obviously, the margins -- the incremental margins in the score is very, very different. And our goal is, in the software business, to as I say start to show some improvement there over time. But this year, as we're kind of turning the steering well a little bit there. As Will said, safe -- flat is safe. And we'd be happy if it's better than that.
Surinder Thind: Understood, and then one final follow-up question. I think one of the -- I think the more anticipated product launches is going to be the new Falcon suite towards the end of the year. As you roll that product suite out, how should we think about the strategy around that? Is the idea to migrate as many existing users over to that platform? Or is it to let the natural client upgrade cycle run its course. And maybe target as many new users for that platform as possible? And I think you guys were kind of providing some color around that. But any additional color would be helpful. Thank you.
Will Lansing: Yeah. I would say it's more of the latter. I think that, our customers decide their rate and pace of upgrades. And our software tends to go in and stay in for quite a long time. It has a long shelf life. And so we're not pushing customers to migrate early or quickly. We do it on the pace that they want. If they want to do it right away, great. And if they want to take their time, that's also okay. We -- certainly, for new customers, we're going to be pushing them in the direction of our latest and greatest products.
Surinder Thind: Okay, that's helpful. And that's it for me. Thank you.
Operator: And Mr. Weber, there are no further questions, at present time. I'll turn the call back to yourself. Thank you.
Steve Weber: Thank you. This concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. Good bye.
Operator: We thank you for your participation. And ask that you please disconnect your lines.

===== 2019 Q4  (2019-11-04 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Fair Isaac Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Monday, November 4, 2019. I would now like to turn the conference over to Steve Weber. Please go ahead.
Steve Weber: Thank you, Dave. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining FICO's fourth quarter earnings call. I'm Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations; and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike McLaughlin. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular in the Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through November 4, 2020. And now, I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
Will Lansing: Thank you, Steve. I'm pleased to report we delivered another very solid quarter, which kept off a remarkable fiscal 2019. In our fourth quarter, we reported revenues of $305 million, an increase of 19% over the same period of last year. For the full fiscal year, we recorded $1.16 billion of revenue, up 16% from 2018. We delivered $55 million of GAAP net income, up 67% and GAAP earnings of $1.80 per share, up 69%. On a non-GAAP basis the $2.01 earnings per share was up 50% from last year and we delivered free cash flow growth as well up 69% from fiscal 2018. I'm particularly pleased with the breadth of strength in our business. Our scores business has been growing very well for the past several years, but we were also able to deliver double-digit growth in our software business this year. We'll have some difficult comps in software next year as we project less upfront license and more ratable revenue, but we're steadily building a growing stream of predictable recurring revenue. In our application segment, we had a particularly strong year with our fraud and compliance solutions with both up double-digit over the previous year. We delivered 8% growth overall in the segment, which had transactional growth of 7%. In our decision management segment, we're validating our strategic vision with financial results. We delivered our largest DMS revenue quarter ever up 41% from last year's fourth quarter and the segment was up 34% for the full year versus fiscal 2018. The bookings were also good. We signed $61 million in new DMS deals this quarter, up 152% from the same quarter last year. For the full year, we signed $157 million of new DMS deals, up 90% versus last year. These solutions are best-in-class or more convinced than ever that there's a significant demand in the marketplace for analytics-driven decisioning software. Overall, our software business performed very well with total annual revenue up 11%. We remain committed to delivering more of our products in the cloud with full year SaaS revenues increasing 12% and SaaS bookings up 24%. In our scores business, we had another very successful year. Scores were up 30% in the quarter versus the prior year and up 25% for the full year. On the B2B side, strong volumes coupled with our strategic pricing drove quarterly revenues up 40% over the prior year. For the full year B2B revenues were up 34%. Our B2C revenues were up 7% versus the Q4 in 2018 and for the full year. We continue to see a positive macro environment for scores. In next year's guidance, which I'll discuss later, we expect the scores business to grow high single-digit, which includes some volume and regular pricing increases, but does not include any strategic pricing increases. We plan to implement some strategic pricing as we've done in the past, but are not including it in our guidance because it's difficult to estimate the timing and magnitude. As we look to 2020, we're excited about the many opportunities ahead for us and how we can refine our business model to deliver an increased operating leverage. Our transition to a platform based cloud first business has involved several years of heavy investment. We developed a goal of having a robust cloud-based decisioning platform that would enable us to dramatically scale our decisioning software business. And we've been able to do that without significant disruption to our income statement as we've shifted from upfront license to ratable cloud revenue. We remain focused on accelerating revenue growth while beginning to increase focus on our software margins. To accomplish this, we're doing two things. First, we're improving our cost structure. As we've grown our cloud business, we're now in a position to look for efficiencies that can be gained from the scale we've reached. We are relentlessly focusing on driving costs out where we can, so that we can improve our margins and still pass savings on to our customers. We'll do this through reducing development costs, increasing standardization and evolving our architecture to make it as efficient as possible. Second, as we've done in the past, we're continually looking at our business and asking ourselves if there are ways to be more efficient and reduce non-essential costs. This re-engineering effort is an essential part of any well run business and it's something we do on a regular basis. The cost savings can either be pass-through to the bottom line or fund important investments in other parts of the company. As always, we strive to be good stewards of these assets and see great opportunities ahead. I'll talk more about our outlook for 2020, but first let me turn the call over to Mike for further financial details.
Mike McLaughlin: Thanks Will and good afternoon everyone. As Will said, we had a solid finish to another terrific year exceeding both our revenue and net income guidance. Revenue for the quarter was $305 million, an increase of 19% over the prior year. Our full year revenue of $1.16 billion was up 16% over last year. Bringing out revenue into our reported segments, applications revenues were $150 million, up 8% versus the same period last year; full year revenues for applications were $605 million, up 7% from last year. The increase in full year revenue was driven by higher usage based volumes and increased term license sales, which included two large multi-year license renewals that were recognized as upfront revenue. In our Decision Management Software, or DMS segment, Q4 revenues were $39 million, up 40% over the same period last year. Full year DMS revenues were $134 million, up 34% from FY 2018. This revenue increase was due to limited – due to increased license and services sales as well as increased volumes and our usage based contracts. And as Will pointed out, DMS bookings were $61 million this quarter, up 152% from the previous year. Finally, our scores segment revenues were $116 million, up 30% from the same period last year, B2B was up 40% over the same period last year and B2C revenues were up 7% from the same period last year. For the full year, scores revenues were $421 million, up 25% from last year. In terms of geographic distribution, this quarter’s 75% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region, our EMEA region generated 17% and the remaining 8% was from Asia Pacific. Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter represented 74% of total revenues. Consulting and implementation revenues were 16% of total revenue and license revenues were 10% of total revenue. SaaS revenues were $270 million for the year, up 12% from 2018. The fourth quarter is typically FICO’s strongest bookings quarter and this year was exceptionally strong. We had record bookings in Q4 of $160 million, up 20% from the previous year. Those bookings generated $25 million of current period revenues, a 15% yield. Full year bookings of $482 million, represents a 10% increase from last year. SaaS bookings were $189 million for the year, up 24% from 2018. As we mentioned last quarter, we were previously running behind our expectations for full year bookings, but we managed to catch up this quarter and finish the year as expected. The back end loading of the bookings will have a timing impact on some revenues as they often take a few quarters for our solutions to go live. Bookings at FICO continue to be highly variable from quarter-to-quarter and they historically have some seasonality. We expect to see good growth in bookings for the full year of 2020, but consistent with typical seasonality, we expect Q1 2020 bookings to be down from Q4 2019. On the expense side of the ledger, our expenses totaled $235 million this quarter, up $7 million from the prior quarter, due to increased personnel costs, data center costs and marketing expense. Our non-GAAP operating margin, as shown in our Reg G schedule, was 30% for both the quarter and the full year. We delivered non-GAAP margin expansion of 400 basis points for the full fiscal year. Working down the income statement to net income and taxes, GAAP net income for the quarter was $55 million, up 67% from the prior year. Our non-GAAP net income was $61 million for the quarter, up 48% from the same quarter last year. For the full year GAAP net income was $192 million, including $31 million in reduced tax expense from excess tax benefits. Non-GAAP net income was $228 million, up 33% from the prior year. The effective tax rate for full year 2019 was 11% including $31 million of reduced tax expense from excess tax benefits recognized upon the settlement or exercise of stock awards. We expect our 2020 recurring tax rate to be approximately 26% to 27% compared with 26% in FY 2019 and that's before an estimated excess tax benefit of about $25 million. The resulting net effective tax rate is estimated to be about 16% to 17% all in. Free cash flow for the quarter was $90 million compared to $53 million in the same period last year. For the full year, free cash flow was $236 million, up 23% from last year's $192 million. As you can see in our prior quarter results, FICO's quarterly free cash flow can vary considerably and has some seasonality primarily as a result of timing of receipts as well as payment of year end incentive compensation. Turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter we had $106 million in cash. This is up $28 million from last quarter due to cash generated from operations, partially offset by 50 million of share repurchases. Our total debt now stands at $830 million with a weighted average interest rate of 4.5%. Turning to return of capital, we bought back 146,000 shares in the fourth quarter at an average price of $343 per share. For fiscal 2019 we repurchased a total of 926,000 shares at an average price of $247 per share for a total of $229 million spent. At the end of September, we had about $220 million remaining on our current repurchase authorization. Finally, before I turn the mike back over to Will, I would like to remind everyone of FICO's capital allocation and return of capital philosophy, and provide guidance for the year. Our capital allocation principles are simple. Maintain a lean cash balance, carry a prudent amount of debt, investment opportunities that we believe will deliver returns well in excess of our cost of capital and return the remaining dollars to shareholders through stock buybacks. Put simply, we strive to run a tight ship and use all the cash that we don't need to buy our own stock. Looking into FY 2020, we believe our cash balance is at an acceptable level and we are comfortable with our current debt balance. Therefore, barring any spending on M&A you should expect us to use approximately 100% of our free cash flow to buy back stock. Of course, the actual amount we spend on buybacks in any given quarter may go up or down based upon free cash flow generation, opportunities that may arise for M&A and overall market conditions. That over the course of the year we plan to spend essentially all of our free cash flow that we don't use on M&A on buying back our stock. Importantly, the share count underlying our EPS guidance, which we'll go through in a moment is based upon the assumption that we buy back stock in equal amounts each quarter at an average price equal to today's stock price. Our actual share count will inevitable vary from what we are assuming today due to movements in the stock price, actual stock based compensation grants, and other factors. But we wanted to lay out clearly the assumptions behind our EPS calculation. With that, I'll turn it back over to Will for his thoughts on FY 2020.
Will Lansing: Thanks Mike. We're speaking to you today from FICO World, which is our Global Decisioning Conference held this week in New York. More than a thousand professionals are here with us from 60 countries to discuss decision management innovations, artificial intelligence, machine learning, analytic innovation, fraud solutions, cyber risk and growth strategies. This sold-out event is an invaluable chance for us to meet with our customers to demonstrate our best-in-class solutions and help them optimize and automate their most difficult decisions. As we move into fiscal 2020, I'm pleased with the progress we've made and excited for what lies ahead. The investments we've been making on the software side have been leading to growth in bookings and recurring sustainable revenue. On the Scores side, the business is stronger than ever and we continue to drive value out of these incredible assets. With all of this in mind, we are providing the following guidance for fiscal 2020. We are guiding revenues of approximately $1.245 billion, an increase of about 7% versus fiscal 2019. We are guiding GAAP net income of approximately $204 million, up 6% versus 2019. GAAP earnings per share of approximately $6.75, non-GAAP net income of $251 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $8.30. I'll now turn the call back over to Steve, who will take Q&A.
Steve Weber: Thanks Will. This concludes our prepared remarks. And we're now ready for your questions. Operator, please open the lines.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.
Manav Patnaik: Good evening guys. Just the first question, Will, I think in your comments you mentioned that the 2020 guidance assumes high single-digit for Scores. I was wondering if you could just give us some color on the software piece of it. And Mike, you talked about the seasonality on the bookings side, if you could just elaborate on that a little bit?
Will Lansing: Yes, I'll make a comment and turn it over to Mike. We see high single-digit for Scores, that's right, and then software will be a little below that and that's mostly because of some revenue recurrent – some revenue that was – that we were forced to take upfront license revenue in 2019, which is going to result in difficult comps for next year. So if you normalize all that, we're headed for a software growth on the order of 7% which is completely consistent with what we actually grew.
Mike McLaughlin: Yes, and I'd add if you want to think about the breakout between the projected Scores growth and software growth overall 7%, software growth is probably about 0.5% less than that, that's more precise than it will end up being of course and Scores growth is probably 1% higher than the average of the two.
Manav Patnaik: Okay, got it. And then just from the cloud perspective, maybe I missed it, can you just remind us the percentage of your business on the growth rate and just a quick comment on the roll-out of Falcon on the cloud as well?
Will Lansing: Sorry, could you repeat the question? I didn't quite get the first one.
Manav Patnaik: The percentage of your revenues that are now on the cloud and what that's growing at?
Will Lansing: Well, we have $270 million of SaaS revenue which is equivalent to – which is equivalent to cloud and you can do the percentage yourself. It's growing at in the teens to low-20s percentages quarter-to-quarter. And we expect that to continue to grow as strategically we shift clients to the platform that we're building.
Mike McLaughlin: And then your question on Falcon X, Falcon X is on track. So we actually have Falcon available in the cloud now, but in terms of getting Falcon onto the platform, what we call Falcon X, that's going to take until – well into 2020. I mean we launched it earlier, but the full robust Falcon X will be later on.
Manav Patnaik: All right, thanks a lot guys.
Will Lansing: Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Bill Warmington: So good evening everyone.
Will Lansing: Hi, Bill.
Bill Warmington: And congratulations on the strong bookings at a $160 million, I think the previous high was a couple of years ago at $146 million, at least that's what I'm showing. So, I had a, a question for you on the deal distribution. It looked like another record point was the 25 deals between $1 million and $3 million and I wanted to know if you could talk a little bit about what verticals you're seeing success in? And how the – what changes you've made to the sales force configuration if any that are driving deals in that segment of the market which seems to be emerging as your sweet spot?
Will Lansing: So, we are – first verticals. So it's still predominantly financial services as it has always been, but we're getting increasing success in Telco and Auto. And so we continue to work deals there. In terms of the sales force configuration, we are adding domain expertise for some of these non-financial services, verticals. So we have a Telco Group now, we have an Auto Group, and so we're going at it that way.
Mike McLaughlin: And Bill, this is Mike, I can give you the specific deal size numbers for this quarter, it happened to be 33 deals over $1 million and nine of which of those were over $3 million. And I'll circle back and answer Manav's question about the seasonality of the bookings, I neglected to do so earlier. If you look at quarterly booking trends for the last couple of years, you will see that typically sort of high teens to 20% of the bookings occur in the first quarter and then ramps throughout the year to be almost 30% in the fourth quarter again typically. Bookings are variable for FICO as you know. So we're not making a specific prediction about what they'll be in the first quarter. But seasonally we would expect them to taper off as usual.
Bill Warmington: Okay. And then on the software margins, the fiscal 2020 guidance would imply another heavy year of investment in the software business, although this is the first time in a while I've heard you talk about putting on some cost efficiencies and focusing increasingly on cost on the software margin side. So is 2020 potentially the year that we see the growth in the expenses in the software business start to slow and or is that more probably a 2021 event?
Will Lansing: I think that we have an effort in that direction but 2021 is a safer bet. The way we think about that one is we have – as we do more and more cloud offering, that carries with it higher cost. And so that's a thing to work against, but the flip side of that is, as we have more scale in cloud, our unit costs go down. And so we're busy trying to identify where there – were in our cloud infrastructure there is savings to be had, that come from scale. And so the two offset each other a little bit, it’s another year of investment, that's true, but at the same time, we're trying to manage expenses as tightly as we can, because we love to see either additional cash freed up for investment or returned to shareholders. So we'll see how this effort goes. But we're focused on it without making a commitment to changing the margins.
Bill Warmington: Okay. And then I wanted to check in on the CCS business, I know a few quarters back there have been a couple of clients who had left. And then some of the client had come back and you had referenced some strong unit volumes in the quarter. And so I – that often ties with CCS, but not necessarily. So I just wanted to ask for some color there.
Will Lansing: CCS is business as usual. It's where – it's a healthy business, we did lose some business, more commodity like business recently. But the business is generally strong.
Mike McLaughlin: Yes, in terms of the growth that we're projecting, as you would expect, DMS should continue to grow at much higher rates than the projected average and apps will go back down to a more normalized rate of low single-digit growth as we move clients onto the platform for strategic reasons. Within that, there is nothing that really stands out at least to me in terms of puts and takes around the product family that we expect to be any different that the past.
Bill Warmington: Got it. Well, last one from me. If I could just ask for an update on the UltraFICO Score, how that's doing? Thanks.
Will Lansing: Yes, the UltraFICO is – it's in test, it's in pilot with customers and we'll see where it goes. Our plan is to get to kind of a more full-scale launch later in the year. It's still on track. So far, early returns are happy with the results and we're seeing – we're seeing improvements in our ability to predict.
Bill Warmington: Thank you very much.
Will Lansing: Thank you, Bill.
Operator: Next question comes from Brett Huff with Stephens. Your line is open.
Brett Huff: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Can you talk a little bit about – in the guidance, you noted that there I think, correct me if I'm wrong that you're assuming volume increases and then sort of the normal price increases that you rolled through most years but not including any of the strategic or special price increases. Two parts, one, can you tell us how the auto price increases are going? I know you used the word feather in to kind of talk about those. Did that – did they feather in more this quarter, is that why we saw the acceleration in B2B, kind of where are we in that penetration or whatever you want to call it. And then as we look into next year or look into fiscal 2020, is there a specific vertical within the Scoring business that you're going to focus on? I think there's maybe talked about card and things like that?
Will Lansing: So with auto, it's gone very smoothly and not surprisingly because, we spent a lot of time thinking about where and how to strategically reprice, I would say that the impact is not fully felt by any means, we're just starting to see it come in. So again we're still not certain on the timing, but it is not reflected in the current numbers. With respect to other strategic areas, if you look at our Scores business, we have mortgage, we have auto and then almost everything else is in one way or another credit card related, we have account management and pre-screening and pre-qual. It's quite a large portfolio of different kinds of things. And so it's not as simple as just saying, oh we raised prices in X, it's definitely a case of us being very surgical in our approach and identifying pockets in that portfolio that can – that are basically demanded in the last that can handle a little bit more price. And so it's not as easy to describe this time around, but the potential is very much there.
Brett Huff: Okay, thanks. And then can you talk a little bit about the homogenization of the platform? I think one example that you gave is that the FICO or the Falcon X is in the cloud, I think on AWS, but maybe not fully on your common platform yet. Is that – where are we in sort of moving everything to that common platform I think using kind of the underlying DMS infrastructure?
Will Lansing: Yes, great question. As you know we have half a dozen major franchises and three of them are moved to the platform. So, origination is now on the platform and Strategy Director, which is the successor to TRIAD, is now on the platform. Blaze, our rules engine is now on the platform. So a number of our major solutions are there. The harder ones are Falcon and Debt Manager, Collections and Recovery and to a lesser extent CCS. And so, we're – Falcon is definitely the highest priority and we have a very strong team, large team working on moving Falcon from just being in the cloud to our cloud ready Falcon X platform based product. CCS is not as far along, but the interconnections with the platform are there. And so, that's less visible. And Debt Manager is a very complex code base. And so, it may remain a separate platform. We may find a way to bring it together. We will make it interoperable one way or another, but that's still under review. So I can't promise that we'll have 100% of our major solutions on the platform in 12 months, but we're almost there.
Brett Huff: So that was going to be kind of my follow up question on that one on the timing. I mean the question was asked before “safer bet” to think about fiscal 2021 as margin improvement. Is that tied to the comment you just made? You don't want to promise 12 months, but maybe a little bit beyond that. Are those – am I putting the dots together there correctly?
Will Lansing: Yes, I mean there's no question that when has more of our business on the platform; the economics are going to improve that. That's the whole idea here. And frankly, it should go along with being able to pass some savings through to customers. I mean, when we have – the platform in its full form, the economics should be good for us and good for our customers.
Brett Huff: Great. That's all I had. I appreciate the time.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open.
Jeff Meuler: Yes, thank you. In terms of what's assumed in the scores revenue guidance, is it basically the typical mid single-digit volume growth that you assume? And then you have the auto pricing effect, especially in Q1 until it’s anniversaried? Or just any other callouts and I guess the other piece I'd be wondering on is if there's a mortgage market assumption?
Will Lansing: Yes, it is the kind of standard price increases. And no, it does not include auto. The auto was – we did auto last year.
Jeff Meuler: Right, I guess, what I'm wondering is did you assume kind of the mid single-digit volume growth plus you have the benefit from auto that you haven't yet anniversaried, so you'll get outsized growth there in Q1? Or are you assuming high single-digit because of something related to the mortgage end market assumption, just given that mortgage has been stronger recently?
Will Lansing: Mike?
Mike McLaughlin: Yes, I can that. We have seen some strength in mortgage origination scores consistent with what you can see in external data from the MBA and otherwise, but that's not directly reflected in the guidance in the scores segment. It really is, as you described, low single-digit volume increases across the board, cost of living type price increases across the portfolio, and really nothing specifically in there for any kind of lingering effects of past price increases.
Jeff Meuler: Okay. And then I guess that it's not baked into the guidance, but it sounds like you're planning some additional special pricing adjustments. Just order of magnitude do they have the potential this next round to have a similar impact on your revenue as the auto pricing or the mortgage pricing, just any rough sizing?
Will Lansing: Yes, as you know, we won't commit to rough sizing, but they do have the potential. I would say the potential is certainly there.
Jeff Meuler: Okay. Thank you. Have a good conference.
Will Lansing: Thank you.
Operator: And that does conclude the Q&A session of the call for today. Gentlemen, I'll turn it back to yourselves. Please continue. Thank you.
Will Lansing: Thank you. Thank you to everyone for joining, and that concludes today's call. We look forward to talking with you again. Thank you.
Operator: And that does conclude the call for today. We thank you very much for your participation. I ask that you please disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-07-31 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Fair Isaac Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. And during the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today Wednesday, July 31, 2019. I would now like to turn the conference over to Steve Weber, VP, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead.
Steve Weber: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining FICO’s third quarter earnings call. I’m Steve Weber, and I’m joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike Pung. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company’s filings with the SEC, in particular in the Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company’s earnings release and the Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and the Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company’s website at fico.com or on the SEC’s website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through July 31, 2020. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
Will Lansing: Thanks, Steve. Thank you, everyone for joining us on our third quarter earnings call. I’m pleased to report we delivered a record quarter with some remarkable results. We recorded our highest revenue quarter ever at $314 million, up 23% over last year. It was a good quarter for license sales but notably, it was also very good quarter for recurring revenue. All three segments drove double-digit recurring revenue growth, and total company recurring revenue was up 18% over last year. We continue to see the benefits of our business model shift to the cloud. We had another good bookings quarter at $109 million with many being recurring revenue deals. Year-to-date, our recurring revenue bookings are up 18%.  We delivered $64 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $2.12 per share up 116% and 122% respectively. We delivered $76 million of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS of $2.50. Perhaps most impressive this quarter was the strength of results across our entire portfolio. In Applications, revenues were up 19% over the prior year. Much of this is due to some term license renewals. We also drove double digit growth in transactional volumes. This of course is key to our cloud strategy is our customers use our products across larger portions of their enterprise, we can drive sustainable recurring revenue growth. We had a particularly strong quarter in our banking fraud solutions business where we closed some large renewals and also signed some sizable new deals. We also had a good quarter in our customer communication solutions where we had nice transactional volume growth. In our Decision Management Software segment, we are seeing significant growth in both bookings and revenue. DMS revenues were record $33 million led by sales of our decisioning platform and Blaze. We also had $37 million of new DMS bookings, a record quarter and up 35% from the previous year. We signed a number of decision management platform deals steadily gaining more traction. Throughout our software business, we are selling more cloud deals. They accounted for more than 40% of our total bookings this quarter. In the Scores business, we had another record quarter at $115 million of revenue with both volumes and unit pricing up over last year. B2C revenues were up 8% this quarter and our B2B revenues were up 36% over the same period last year. The B2B growth was driven by increased originations and account management volumes as well as the continuing impact of the pricing initiatives we discussed last quarter. We see strength throughout the various verticals and life cycles in the Scores segment and expected to continue to perform well. We are also making progress on data decision cloud partnership with Equifax that we announced back in March. Our teams are working together to bring three products to market. First, connected platform integrating our decision management solution with Equifax as extensive data. Second, our suite of AML and KYC technology. We’ll use Equifax’ differentiated data to offer a full-service, best-in-class compliance offering. And third, Prescreen Central integrates FICO’s Marketing Solutions products with Equifax’ consumer data to deliver a direct marketing solution. We’ll keep you posted on the progress we’re making with this exciting partnership. Finally, we continue to deploy significant resources to our share repurchase program. In the third quarter, we spent $59 million and another $20 million in July for a total so far this fiscal year of $199 million. We exhausted the 2018 Board authorization and today we announced a new $250 million share repurchase authorization. I’ll share some summary thoughts later, but now I’d like to turn the call over to Mike to take you through our financial results.
Mike Pung: Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I’ll emphasize three points in my prepared comments. First, we delivered $314 million of revenue, an increase of $59 million or 23% year-over-year. Recurring revenue was $226 million, up 18% from last year. Second, we delivered $64 million of GAAP net income, which is up 116% year-over-year. And finally, we had $61 million of free cash flow this quarter, and we spent $59 million of it on share repurchases. I’ll begin by breaking the revenue down into our three segments. Starting with Applications, where revenues were $166 million or up 19% versus the same period last year. We had a particularly strong quarter in fraud, which was up 80% in part due to some term license renewals. We also had a good quarter in our CCS business, which was up 13% compared to last year. And we also saw strong volumes throughout the portfolio with recurring revenues up 10%. We had another good quarter in our Decision Management Software segment, where revenues were at $33 million, up 31% versus the prior year, with strong platform and Blaze sales. Recurring revenue in DMS were up 14% from the previous year. Bookings were a record $37 million or up 35% from last year. And finally, of course, in our Scores segment, revenues were a record $115 million, up 27% from the same period last year and 10% over last quarter. On the B2B side, we are up 36% versus the same period a year ago, and B2C revenues were up 8% from the same quarter last year. Looking at revenue by region. This quarter 72% of total revenues were derived from the Americas. The EMEA region generated 21% and the remaining 7% was Asia Pacific. Recurring revenue derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter represented 72% of total revenue. Consulting and implementation revenues were 14% of total revenue and license revenues were 14% of total revenue. Cloud revenues were $69 million this quarter, up 19% from last year. Bookings this quarter were $109 million, down about 9% from the prior year. We generated $16 million of current period revenues on those bookings for a yield of 15%, and the weighted average term of our bookings was 38 months this quarter. We had 19 deals over $1 million, four of which were over $300 million. Cloud bookings were $46 million this quarter and $119 million year-to-date, which is up 24% from last year. While we are pleased with the sixth straight quarter above $100 million in bookings. Year-to-date, we are still facing below our expectations, which is important as bookings generate future revenue. Operating expenses totaled $229 million this quarter compared to $230 million in the second quarter. We expect to maintain a similar run rate in the fourth quarter, while actively investing our resources in our highest strategic priorities. Our non-GAAP operating margin, as shown in our Reg G schedule was 34% for the quarter and 29% year-to-date. We expect the full year operating margin to be around that 29%. GAAP net income this quarter was $64 million or $2.12 a share and non-GAAP net income was $76 million or $2.50 a share, and the effective tax rate was about 18% for the quarter. We expect our annual tax rate to be about 14%. The free cash flow for the quarter was $61 million versus $72 million in the prior year. And for the trailing 12 months, our free cash flow was around $200 million. Now turning to the balance sheet, we had $79 million of cash at the end of the quarter. Our total debt is $828 million with a weighted average interest rate of about 4.7%. The ratio of our total debt – net debt to adjusted EBITDA this quarter is down to 2.3 times, which is well below our covenant level of three times During the quarter, we returned $59 million in excess cash to our investors, repurchasing 205,000 shares at an average price of about $289 a share. We also purchased an additional 20 million in July, which exhausted the Board authorization from last year. We have repurchased more than 840,000 shares this fiscal year at an average price of $237. We announced earlier today, the Board has approved a new $250 million authorization and continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of our cash. And we also continue to actively evaluate opportunities to acquire relevant technologies and products that advance our strategy or strengthen our portfolio and competitive position. Now with one quarter remaining in our fiscal year, we are reconfirming our guidance that we updated last quarter, with revenue of $1.14 billion, GAAP net income of $173 million and GAAP EPS of $5.75. Of course non-GAAP net income is $214 million and non-GAAP EPS is $7.12. Finally, as you know, this is my 60th and last official earnings call. For those of you on the call that cover FICO, I’ve appreciated the time we spent discussing our company and getting to know each of you on a personal level. I’d also like to give my heartfelt thanks to all the members of our finance team, your hard work, dedication and commitment to operate with the highest standards has given me confidence in reporting our results over the years. And finally, I’d like to thank our investors for the trust and faith you have placed in me as a steward of these amazing assets. With that, I’ll turn the call back over to Will for some final comments.
Will Lansing: Thanks, Mike. Next quarter, we’ll talk about our expectations for 2020. But for now, I’d like to review what we’ve been able to accomplish in 2019. In Scores, we continue to find new ways to extend the analytics in both the B2B and B2C markets, and we are working hard to make sure pricing is appropriate, given the massive value that the FICO Score adds in the financial markets. On the Software side, we are steadily growing our cloud business and our products are well positioned to serve customers looking to use analytics to make better decisions. As I’ve often said, these are exciting times at FICO, we have a very strong team helping our customers solve their most difficult problems and we continue to develop and market world-class technology you put advanced analytics into production to make better decisions. Finally, I would like to thank Mike, who is retiring after nearly 15 years with FICO, the last nine as Chief Financial Officer. During his career, FICO revenues grew from around $600 million in fiscal 2010 to this year’s guided $1.1 billion. Mike oversaw an ambitious long-term stock buyback program that increased value for shareholders, while enabling FICO to advance its innovations and analytics and solution development. Mike has been a great CFO. He distinguished himself with the Board and with our investors and guided us through the last recession, driving critical resource allocation decisions that gave FICO the runway to invest again in new products and services. We thank him and wish him well. I’d also like to welcome Mike McLaughlin to FICO as our new CFO. Mike will be joining us from Morgan Stanley, where he was a Managing Director and Head of Technology Corporate Finance. He brings us a wealth of leadership experience in both financial services and technology. He’d be starting next week and looks forward to meeting with many of you in the coming months. I’ll now turn the call back to Steve for Q&A.
Steve Weber: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks and we are ready now to take your questions. Operator, please open the lines.
Operator: Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is over.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you, good evening. And firstly congratulations and a big thank you to Mike as well. If I could just start with the bookings comments that you made about it being below expectations. And I was just wondering if you could help give a little bit more color on maybe how much below and why you think it is below the expectation?
Mike Pung: I guess I would say, I wouldn’t put too much stock in it, that number does move around, how it is when deals push at the end of the quarter. We’ve pretty consistently shared with you that we don’t do unnatural acts to close deals at the end of the quarter. And so while we have an internal budget that has numbers for each quarter. I wouldn’t read too much into it.
Manav Patnaik: Got it. And then maybe along the same lines, like you obviously had a pretty good quarter, and I guess I just wanted to get some sense on maybe why there wasn’t a guidance raise involved in there with only a quarter to go, presumably there’s enough visibility there?
Will Lansing: That cuts both ways. Yes, there’s enough visibility, but at the same time, we’re one quarter away from closing out the year. I’m not sure what the point would be in raising guidance at this point.
Manav Patnaik: Okay. And then maybe just one last one from me. We obviously heard Equifax talk about these products that you guys are putting out together. Just can you just help us with a little bit on, is it a revenue share model or who is going to do most of the heavy lifting on the sales front? Any other color there, please.
Will Lansing: Sure. I mean it is a rev share model. We're in it together. We're trying to market the solution as a joint solution and make it easier for the customer to get the end-to-end solution on offer. The sales effort is on both sides, and it depends on who has which relationships and which product that – product and service we're working with. So I think that varies.
Manav Patnaik: Okay, got it. Thank you guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Bill Warmington : Good afternoon everyone. 
Will Lansing: Hi Bill.
Mike Pung: Hi Bill.
Bill Warmington : So the Scores revenue looked particularly strong this quarter accelerating from last quarter accelerating from last quarter. Is there any reason why that Scores volume should decline next quarter? It seems like it's pretty much a stairstep in terms of the price increases coming on.
Will Lansing: Well Bill, so this quarter, we saw some of the additional feathering in of our auto scores that we described in the last call. We also saw a couple of residual customers start to roll in on the mortgage increase we did just over a year ago. And so beyond that, we had small audit settlement that's one-timer that was in these numbers. From time to time, we have global FICO Score deals that are license oriented, and we had a little bit of that this quarter. Those come and go on a variety of basis. And we saw volume increases in the mid-single-digit range and in a couple of cases on the origination side a little bit better than that. So with all that as a background, the revenue model could grow, assuming volumes continue to grow strongly over where it was last year in the fourth quarter, and that's probably the biggest variable that's uncertain at this point is how much of the volumes will look like in our fourth quarter and whether we have any other kind of onetimers that come along. 
Bill Warmington : Okay. So now CCS, there've been some client departures last quarter, but this quarter, you guys signaled that one out as being particularly strong performance. I just wanted to ask about how that business was doing and what had happened with those clients who had left and whether you've been able to get new clients to replace them, just a little color on that.
Will Lansing: Yes, I'd say that we have business coming and business going. Some of the business goes when big banks decide that they're going to try to achieve the same thing that our CCS offering does on their own by putting together with a fair bit of systems integration on their side the components of it. And while we have very large banks who are happy with CCS, there's also the ones that used to do it alone. We are adding business. We're adding business in Asia. We're adding business around the world, and so we're still very happy with the business.
Bill Warmington : So I noticed that the average term of the bookings this quarter went up to 38 months, and maybe you could talk a little bit about that occurrence. Is that a one-off event in terms of some of the deals that you signed? Or maybe you can give us a little quarter color on what's behind that increase.
Will Lansing: It's been trending upward for years, and I think it's a reflection of the fact that the solutions that we're putting in place are more complex, more comprehensive and once installed, the customer has a desire to lock down longer term. And so we're seeing some of that. We don't have tremendous financial incentives for our salespeople to go push long terms. We really want to do just what the customer wants. And so I would say that the term length is really dictated by the customer, and I think it's largely because they put and our solutions, and they're not quick to take them up, and they feel more comfortable signing up the bigger deal.
Bill Warmington : And how's the rollout of Falcon X doing?
Will Lansing: It's rolling. We're excited about the prospects we're getting in onto the marketplace. The early reception to what's coming has been extremely positive, and so we think we have the right – we have the right solution coming at the right time. We have a lot of people working on it right now.
Bill Warmington : And then the last question for me is on the UltraFICO Score. Experian has been running ads on their Boost product. I want to know it's actually generating revenue for yet? Or is it still pre-revenue? 
Will Lansing: With Boost, we actually participate in that. With UltraFICO not generating revenue, yes, we're in test mode still. 
Bill Warmington : Got it. Before I go, I just wanted to say congratulations to Mike on a great run and happy trails.
Mike Pung: Thanks, Bill. We'll come out and see you sometime.
Will Lansing: Thanks Bill.
Bill Warmington : Pleased to do.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens. Your line is open
Brett Huff: Hey guys, congrats on a nice quarter and thanks for the detail as always. And Mike sorry to see you go, but I hope things go well in the next chapter.
Mike Pung: I appreciate that Brad.
Brett Huff: Well thanks for taking the questions as always. Can you guys – you guys talked a little bit about some of the SaaS products that you're developing and I know that we're midstream on those. Can you give us – I don't know if you mentioned TRIAD or the next-gen product that TRIAD is. I think it's a customer director if I'm remembering it right. Any update on how that's coming along?
Will Lansing: Yes. Yes, it's actually called Strategy Director, which is the successor to TRIAD. Customer Management is what it does. It's going really well so there's absolutely uptake the market for it. And for us, Strategy Director is a lot of the TRIAD functionality but ported over to our Decision Management Platform business, and that's becoming increasingly important for us. I mean we're really focused on how to resolve our customers' needs with our platform solution. And although we still sell some things that are not on the platform, increasingly, the solutions are on the platform. And so Originations is on the platform, Strategy Director is now on the platform, Falcon X will be in the platform.  And so this idea of getting to a unified kind of single code based platform with tremendous ease of use and ability to manipulate data across for different purposes, it's coming together very nicely. But with respect to Strategy Director, in particular, we're doing very well or selling it, and we're happy with it.
Brett Huff: That's a nice segue to my next question. I know a lot of folks look at your business and think there is sort of margin in there to be realized over time. I know you're investing kind of in demand that you really see coming over the hill. Just kind of – you're mentioning sort of centralizing on a more common platform raises that question, maybe highlights that possibility for showing some more margin over time. Is that how we should think about? Is that sort of a gross margin focus once you get everything centralized? And how do you think about the tenor of that?
Will Lansing: Yes, I would say that's a very astute question because that really is how you should think about it. Today, we have really broad portfolio software solutions with a lot of customization, and it's expensive – not expensive but it takes a lot of PS resources to install and to customize to our customers' satisfaction. And with the platform, that's going to be simplified. With the platform, there will be a lot much higher level of configuration, there will be returns to scale for us and there will be benefits for the customer from total cost of ownership.  So as more and more of our new business winds up on the platform, yes, I think it's reasonable to expect that margins will go up. That's not guidance for next year, but that's just a reality that's in the economics of getting to a platform business.
Brett Huff: That’s helpful. And then can you just remind us your view on total Scores through the cycle? If I recall I think it went from maybe $8 billion, or now at $11 billion, something like that. Is your sense – first, remind us if that's right. And then the second is we get a lot of questions, is the FICO Score less cyclical now than it was before? I think the answer is yes, but kind of give us your view on that and how – I won't say revenues will go for Scoring, but how the durability of the score usage might be this time around if we have a recession.
Will Lansing: Sure. So the low point was right after the 2008 reset and we were about $9 billion scores then. The high point was 13.5 billion right before that. Today, we have not yet hit that $13.5 billion…
Mike Pung: $14.5 billion
Will Lansing: I'm sorry $14.5 billion today, so we've just surpassed that level. But the more important part of your question is right, which is how sensitive are we to economic cycles and what happens in the future? And I would say that we have a lot more scores than we used to have. I mean we have more breadth there. We're starting to sell scores internationally and so there's a little bit of high diversification there, and we have more flexibility in what we charge. So I think that the – well, obviously, we're not immune, we would suffer with volumes declining. I don't think it would be anything like what it once was.
Brett Huff: Okay. And then last question from me, when we think about DMS and I think about Big Data and analytics. I think the Equifax partnership looks great. But it seems to me that DMS and Big Data are going to be, I'm not sure, is there a killer app for Big Data out there. I know you kind of had killer apps in Falcon and TRIAD, I know those are all kind of based on the same thing. But are you seeing emerging a use case that that we're not seeing yet that you're getting more excited about that might power more consistent DMS growth?
Will Lansing: We definitely expect more consistent DMS growth and a lot more of it. I'm not sure that I would call it a single use case except it's a very high level. I think that the use case is digital transformation. I think what we have is a situation where financial services has run 7%, 8% of GDP for quite a long time. And over the coming 10 years, it will probably get cut into half as those products and services are provided through automation, through using lower cost means. And I think that our Decision Management Platform is aimed at providing data-driven decisioning to power those kinds of decisions.  So I would say that as banks continue on their journey to – their digital transformation journey, as they continue to try to look at disparate data to have a more comprehensive view of a customer, the 360-degree view of the customer. As they seek to understand the customer journey better, all those things speak to the value of our Decision Management Platform as a solution. I don't think it's a single use case, I mean I think historically banks have had a need for a single use, for Originations for some area, for collections and recovery for some area, for fraud for some area. I think increasingly, we're going to see the lines blur there and banks will be seeking more comprehensive solutions, but the likes of which we have in decision management suite.
Brett Huff: Great. Thanks for taking my questions and good luck, again, Mike.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Adam Klauber with William Blair. Your line is open.
Adam Klauber: Good afternoon. Thanks. As far as price increases, you obviously got mortgage, auto. How is the dialogue now in credit cards? And if you could give us an idea, do you think that's likely or unlikely?
Mike Pung: I think that all the scores beyond mortgage and auto is a bigger and more disparate group of scores, and so there is not a simple answer to that. I think that we always evaluate where there's opportunities. And it's not as clean as saying well here's the next thing that we're going to go do. But I think you can expect that we'll systematically look for opportunities.
Adam Klauber: Okay. And then on the Scores, what do you think is going to drive B2C revenues going forward – revenue growth going forward. Still growing at a decent pace, but somewhat slower than it was in the last year or two? 
Will Lansing: I would say, more of the same. It'll be some time before ultra FICO and things like that really make an impact. The volumes were more of a lagging indicator than a leading indicator. And so the volumes, you have greater visibility into what the volumes are likely to be than I would say we do, because we follow interest rates. So I think your guess is as good as ours on where it goes. We feel pretty good about things. But I think you should consult your own crystal ball.
Adam Klauber: Sure. Okay. And then as far as Falcon, I know you've had some sales internationally, I think South America. How is the pipeline for future Falcon sales?
Will Lansing: Strong and South America has been really strong.
Adam Klauber: Okay. Is that…
Mike Pung: Adam some of our biggest deals this quarter were Falcon and Falcon in the cloud. Two of our top 10, as an example, were deals that we signed down in Latin America in the last three months that were tied to Falcon. So despite the fact that we have a pretty big installed base, there are pockets of opportunity especially with the cloud that are coming along.
Adam Klauber: Okay. Thanks a lot guys.
Operator: And gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to yourselves. Please continue with your presentation or closing remarks.
Will Lansing: Thank you very much. That concludes today's call . Thank you all for joining.
Operator: And that does conclude the call for today. We thank you for your participation. And I ask you please disconnect your line.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-04-30 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Fair Isaac Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's Tuesday, April 30th, 2019. I would now like to turn the conference over to Steve Weber. Please go ahead.
Steve Weber: Thank you, Eric. Good afternoon and thank you for joining FICO's second quarter earnings call. I'm Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike Pung. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular in the Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website, or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and the Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and the Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through April 30th, 2020. And now I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
Will Lansing: Thank you, Steve and thank you everyone for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. We delivered another solid quarter as we continue to see traction in our software business and amazing opportunities in our Scores business. Because of the increased visibility into our growth, today, we are raising our full year guidance. In our second quarter, we reported revenues of $278 million, an increase of 9% over the same period last year. We delivered $33 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $1.10 per share. We delivered $47 million of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS of $1.56. We had another good bookings quarter, with more than $100 million in bookings for the fifth consecutive quarter. And we continue to book a lot of new cloud deals. In fact, year-to-date, our cloud bookings are up 43% versus the first half of last year. Our software revenue was up a modest 3% this quarter. Applications were down 3% as we had less upfront license sales and services revenue than last year, while our decision management software was up 41%. Some of the decision management increase was due to licenses, but we're also seeing the benefit of services and transactional revenues from deals we've signed in previous quarters. As we have said, we're happy with the strategic investments we've made, and our innovative technology has been recognized by the industry. In fact, a recent Chartis report named FICO a category leader in AI for financial services and pointed to completeness of offerings and market potential. It's another data point that increases our confidence in investing in technology that helps banks meet ever more sophisticated requirements. As you know, last month, we announced a partnership with Equifax to provide a connected platform experience combining Equifax data with our FICO decision management platform. Since then, we've met with a number of customers who are intrigued with the potential of the turnkey cloud applications we are rolling out. We'll continue to keep you posted on our progress. I view this as an important initiative for FICO and I believe it will greatly expand the footprint of our decision management platform. In the Scores business, we had another great quarter as we saw stable volumes and the partial effects of price increases that began to take effect in our second quarter. Total revenues were up 20% versus the prior year and totaled $104 million. On the B2B side, revenues were up 27% over the same period as last year. This was primarily due to targeted price increases as well as some new product innovations. We implemented some price adjustments in January, and they have been phasing in the last few months. B2C revenues were up 5% this quarter and 7% year-to-date. We're pursuing a number of potential deals and still see many opportunities in this space. And we remain focused on driving shareholder value. We've repurchased $120 million in shares halfway through our fiscal year, and we worked diligently to efficiently allocate resources, accelerate free cash flow, and improve margins while still investing for the future. I'll share some summary thoughts later, but now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike for further financial details.
Mike Pung: Thanks, Will. Good afternoon everyone. Today, I'll emphasize three points in my remarks. First, we delivered $278 million of revenue. That's an increase of $22 million or 9% year-over-year. Our recurring revenue was $212 million, which is up 10% from last year driven by the strength in our Scores business. Second, we delivered $33 million of GAAP net income, up 7% year-over-year, and EPS of $1.10 per share, up 10%. Finally, we are raising our guidance to reflect the momentum we are seeing in our Scores business. I'll begin by breaking down revenue into our three reported segments, starting with applications, where revenues were $142 million, which is down 3% versus the same period last year and is due to reductions in upfront license sales and services. Our applications bookings of $63 million is down 9% from last year. We do expect license revenue to expand over the remainder of the year due to several large term license renewals. In the decision management software segment, revenues were $32 million, which is up 41% versus the prior year due primarily to increased services revenues as we implement new installations and deploy analytic models. Recurring revenue in DMS were up 4% from the previous year. Bookings were $28 million, which is up 41% from last year. And finally, in the Scores segment, revenues were $104 million, which is up 20% from last year. On the B2B side, we were up 27% due primarily to some targeted price increases that began to feather in during the quarter. The B2C revenues were up 5% from the same quarter last year. We expect continued growth, particularly from B2B, as the pricing increases continue to ramp up. Looking at revenues by region. This quarter, 78% of total revenues were derived in the Americas. Our EMEA region generated 15%. And the remaining 7% was from Asia-Pacific. Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter represented 76% of total revenue. Consulting and implementation revenues were 18% and license revenues were just 6% of total revenues. Cloud revenues were $67 million this quarter, which is up 6% from last year. The growth rate was lower this quarter due to some customer churn on our CCS product. Year-to-date cloud revenues are $130 million, which is up 9% from last year. Bookings this quarter were $106 million, up 4% from the prior year. We generated $15 million of current period revenue on those bookings for a yield of 14%. The weighted average term for the bookings was 32 months this quarter. This quarter, we had 12 deals between $1 million and $3 million, and we booked an additional seven deals over $3 million. In addition, cloud bookings were $29 million this quarter, down slightly from last year due to the timing of signed deals. Operating expenses totaled $230 million this quarter compared to $213 million in our first quarter. The increase relates primarily to variable expenses associated with increased revenue and employee incentive costs. We expect to maintain our current cost run rate over the back half of the year while actively investing our resources in our highest strategic priorities. As you can see in our Reg G schedule, our non-GAAP operating margin was 25% in the second quarter, and it is 26% year-to-date. We expect that operating margins will be between 26.5% to 28.5% for the full year. GAAP net income was $33 million or $1.10 per share, and non-GAAP net income was $47 million or $1.56 per share. The effective tax rate was about 16% this quarter, and we expect our tax rate to be about 14% for the fiscal year. The free cash flow for the quarter was $44 million versus $42 million in the prior year, with a trailing 12-month free cash flow of $211 million. Now, looking at the balance sheet, we had $77 million of cash on hand at the end of the quarter. Our total debt is $828 million, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.8%. And the ratio of our total net debt to adjusted EBITDA this quarter is 2.6 times, which is below the covenant level of three. Depending on marketing conditions, we may be refinancing some of our fixed debt that will be maturing over the next 16 months. During the quarter, we returned $37 million of excess cash to our investors, repurchasing 150,000 shares at an average price of $247. Through the first two quarters of the year, we've repurchased 575,000 shares at an average price of $208. We still have about $80 million remaining on the Board authorization and continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. We also continue to actively evaluate opportunities to acquire relevant technologies and products that advance our strategy or strengthen our portfolio and competitive position. And finally, as Will mentioned, we are raising our previously provided guidance. Our new guidance for the full fiscal year 2019 is as follows; we expect revenue to be approximately $1.14 billion, up from the previously guided $1.125 billion. GAAP net income is now expected to be approximately $173 million and GAAP earnings per share is now approximately $5.75 per share. Non-GAAP net income is now expected to be $214 million or $7.12 per share. With that, I'll turn it back over to Will for final comments.
Will Lansing: Thanks Mike. We're halfway through another fiscal year and we're very well-positioned for the future. Our customers are increasingly seeking better, more advanced analytics and technology to optimize their most difficult decisions and we are ready and able to help them. As a result, our pipeline is very robust. We have more and bigger deals in our pipeline than ever before. We have a great team in place, and we're effectively executing on our cloud strategy to drive profitable recurring revenue and earnings growth. I'll now turn the call back to Steve for Q&A. 
Steve Weber: Thanks Will. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we're now ready to take any questions you may have. Eric, please open the lines.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. Good evening guys. Just on the guidance raise. So most of the raise that was shared was because of the price increases that are going into effect on the B2B Scores side. And then does that mean you still expect that kind of 9% growth from the software this year as well?
Mike Pung: Partially, Manav. So, yes, in fact, the increase in the revenue guidance is driven from the Scores pricing, which we have some visibility now to the back half of the year. That's a bit offset by our growth in the software business. As you remember, last quarter, we fell short of our revenue growth on professional services. We made a little bit of it back here in the second quarter, but we expect, for the full year, we'll likely fall short, putting our software growth somewhere around 7%-ish, plus or minus. So, we're bringing that number back slightly and it's being replaced by the Scores item.
Manav Patnaik: Got it. And then just on the B2C Scores, the 5% growth feels a little light, was there any in comps that are pioneering, or anything going on there?
Mike Pung: No, nothing really going on there. It's growth that's coming through our partner pipeline, mainly through Experian.
Manav Patnaik: Got it. And then just lastly, Will, maybe some broad color on the cloud transition, the SaaS transition, how you think about that progress so far?
Will Lansing: We're pleased with our progress and we still have plenty of work ahead. We are now at the point where all of our major franchises are available on the cloud. We have Falcon X coming out, which is our cloud version of Falcon, coming out this year and that's positioning us even more strongly in the cloud. But we still have work to do in terms of simplifying the product and consolidating the code base. And so I would say that there's more work ahead, but we're really feeling good about it. The infrastructure is really solid. The reliability is there. The geographic reach is there. We have great network ops and operational control of it. So, we're pretty happy about that.
Manav Patnaik: Okay, got it. Thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Bill Warmington: Good afternoon everyone. So, an initial question for you on this -- on the special price increase in auto, and maybe it would help if you compare and contrast that one with the mortgage price increase from last year. You guys referenced a couple of terms in terms of the increase being partial and feathering in. So is there something that's different about the structure of the auto industry that -- where the price increase is going through a little more slowly than it did for mortgage? 
Will Lansing: Yes, that's exactly right, Bill. It's slightly different, and we have some lagging price coming in. And so that it's as simple as that. I mean it's still quite a major move in auto.
Mike Pung: I would add one other thing, Bill and that is we've, both with mortgage and auto, we've always said we will grandfather in any committed dates that exists with our resellers, the three bureaus. And in the case of auto, there are some committed dates that extend out, and so that's why it feathers in a little bit slower. And also, the timing by which the credit bureaus implement their rate card with the end customers is different than it is for mortgage. And so those are a little bit in nuanced discussions that, I guess, add on to what Will said.
Bill Warmington: Got it, that's helpful. And then on the bookings detail, it looked like the transaction and maintenance bookings went from about 55% of total bookings in the December quarter to about 35% of total bookings in the March quarter. I just wanted to ask what was going on behind that.
Mike Pung: Really nothing. You are right, those are correct numbers. And in the first quarter as in some prior quarters, we had a heavier percentage of deals that we signed that were transactional or license-oriented. This quarter happened to be one that was very heavy PS-oriented. I think roughly 60% or something close to 60% of our bookings this quarter are PS, which will burn off here probably in the next six to nine months. So, there really is nothing to it other than the mix of the deals that we signed this quarter than in the past several.
Bill Warmington: Okay. And then on the timing of the cloud bookings for the quarter, the $29 million, that was below the last couple of quarters. When you reference timing, do you mean there were some deals that potentially were going to book in the March quarter that are going to book in the June quarter? Or -- I just want to ask a little more detail on that.
Mike Pung: Yes, that's exactly right. I mean we obviously are sensitive to the customers who want to sign deals by the end of the quarter, but we don't go the extra mile in terms of trying to get something signed by the end of March as compared to something in April or May. And practically speaking, these cloud deals are all ratable revenue anyway, and so it's simply a timing of one quarter to the next. And frankly, that's all it was this quarter. We were happy with over $100 million, and it certainly could have been a much larger number. And hopefully, we'll make some of that up in the back half of the year.
Bill Warmington: Yes. And you guys have referenced the transition from the upfront license fee model to the SaaS cloud delivery model as being a headwind to revenue and margins in the past. I just want to know if you could help us quantify how much of a headwind that is currently or if you want to talk about it in terms of the current quarter or in terms of the guidance. 
Mike Pung: Yes. So, under the old accounting rules, Bill, 605, it was a headwind. I think as I mentioned last quarter when we first had to implement the new revenue rule, 606, there was a strange little component to that rule for on-premise software, which is whenever there is a renewal or a new license deal signed on-premise, if there are guaranteed minimums in the contract, those guaranteed minimums are required to be recognized upfront under the old rule rather than ratably under the old rules.
Will Lansing: Under the new rule.
Mike Pung: I'm sorry, under the new rule.
Will Lansing: Upfront.
Mike Pung: And they're recognized upfront now. And we do have Falcon renewals from time to time that carry guaranteed minimums in there, and so that's actually created some license revenue that we are claiming this year, including in quarter two that we didn't claim in the past. So, what we are finding this year with these renewals is that we have more license revenue than we built into our plan and that's offsetting some of the softness in the recurring revenue that we're seeing from some churn on a couple of customers in CCS.
Bill Warmington: Okay. And then final question for you. It looked like most of the expense increase on a year-over-year basis was in the personnel department. So, I just wanted to ask for a little color on that. Is most of that going into R&D personnel? Or is that for implementation of the bookings? I just wanted to get a little -- see if we could get a little color there. 
Mike Pung: Yes. I call it two broad things. So, the first is we have continued to add headcount in the organization. And the headcount is primarily being added in R&D and operations, so that hits a combination of cost of goods and a combination of the R&D line item. That's where the heads are being added in. Also, as we've added in some heads for the existing employee base, we did as we typically do our annual compensation increase, which took effect in December. So, the January through March is the first full quarter in which we have a 3% salary increase in effect for the remainder of the employees. So, between the headcount added and the annual increase, that's the category that is driving the biggest part of the increase. The rest of the increase is frankly tied to variable incentive comp, commissions and incentive comp for the rest of the organization. And as a result of raising the guidance, it also affects that incentive comp line item, and we, as a result, have to increase our accruals to catch up not only for the first quarter, but the second quarter. So, those are really the two things that are driving the cost increase. That's why we believe it's going to level out over the rest of the year.
Bill Warmington: Got it. Well, thank you very much.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, hi guys. This is Joel [Indiscernible] on for Brett Huff. I just want to ask on the M&A comment, what kind of assets would you guys be looking at? And for the right deal, is that something that you would lever up? Are these going to be more tuck-in acquisitions that you'd be looking at going forward? Thank you.
Will Lansing: So, I think we've discussed this in the past, but it is probably worth reiterating. We are always looking for interesting acquisition opportunities. We have a very active corporate development arm. And the challenge for us -- and we do -- as you noted, we do from, time-to-time, do small tuck-in acquisitions for talent or little pieces of technology that we think would extend our franchises nicely. The more interesting question that we wrestle with is there are a lot of businesses out there that were we to merge or acquire them would result in accretion. And the problem is that we don't like their businesses as much as we like our own business. And so every time it comes down to do you want to get bigger by acquisition, our bar is we have to like their business as much as we like our own business, and that is a very, very high bar. And so I would never say never, and under the right circumstances, yes, we would lever up to do it. But we've been -- I've been CEO of FICO for seven years, looking for the last five, and I haven't come across the one that makes financial sense and is as attractive a business as our own. So, we just take the money and we buy back FICO stock with it and give it back to our owners.
Operator: All right. And Mr. Weber, we have no further questions from the phone lines. I'll turn it back to you.
Steve Weber: All right. Thank you. This concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining us.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-01-30 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Fair Isaac Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, January 30, 2019. I would now like to turn the conference over to Steve Weber. Please go ahead, sir.
Steve Weber: Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining FICO's First Quarter Earnings Call. I'm Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing and our CFO, Mike Pung. Will is dialing-in from India, where he is attending a company event, so we apologize in advance, if we have any technical issues with his connection. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. FICO adopted the new accounting standard Topic 606 as of October 1, 2018. We have also adjusted our FY18 results under this standard and posted that on our website. Today, all comparisons will be made using the adjusted numbers. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular in the Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and the Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and the Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through January 30, 2020. And with that, we'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
Will Lansing: Thank you, everyone for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. Before I get started today, we also announced that Mike is planning to retire at the end of the year. Mike has been an integral part of the great story we have here at FICO. For the last 14 years, he has dedicated himself to creating shareholder value and he will be sorely missed. We are fortunate to have a strong finance team in place. Mike will continue to serve the company through the year, while we search for his replacement. With that, let's move on to the quarter. We're off to a good start this fiscal year with continued bookings and revenue growth and we're well positioned for 2019. In our first quarter, we reported revenues of 262 million, an increase of 13% over the same period last year. We delivered 40 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $1.32 per share, up 22% and 27% from the same period last year. We delivered 44 million of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS of $1.45 per share. On the software side of our business, we continue to grow our revenues even as we build to our recurring revenue base. Our application segment was up 5% over last year and our decision management segment was up over 22%. We had another strong bookings quarter with more than 100 million in new deals for the fourth consecutive quarter.  I'm particularly pleased with the progress we're making in Latin America, where we've signed four deals valued at more than 3 million and another three deals valued at more than 1 million. We have a strong team in Latin America and our acquisition last quarter of GoOn, the credit risk management consulting firm based in Brazil will bolster our efforts in that rapidly growing region. Overall, our cloud-based revenues were up 14%, and our cloud-based bookings were up 134% over the same period last year. This quarter included two large Falcon cloud deals and a large Strategy Director deal. In the Scores business, we continue to drive significant growth. Revenues this quarter were up 25% from the same period last year. On the B2C side, revenues were up 9% over the previous year, with most of the growth [Technical Difficulty].
Mike Pung: Hey, Will. Are you still on the line? We dropped your voice. Let me pick up where Will has left off here and Will will join us hopefully in progress. On the B2C side, revenues were up 9% over the previous year with most of the growth coming through our partnerships. We also signed a new customer, which converted their consumer education programs from an educational score to the FICO score in January. On the B2B side, revenues were up 36% over the previous year, due primarily to the 2018 price adjustments. Scores revenue were down sequentially, but that was primarily due to our seasonality. We anticipate we will continue to have strong Scores growth in fiscal year ‘19, as new pricing adjustments took place in January. We continue to be excited about the long-term prospects of our Scores business where we have many growth opportunities. In China for instance, we continue to gain traction as banks are increasing their volumes and new banks are testing the FICO score. It's still very early stage, but we will continue to provide updates in coming quarters, as the revenues become meaningful. Our Open Access program hit another milestone in December, when we announced that 300 million consumer accounts now have free access to the FICO score that is used by the lenders to manage accounts. More than 170 financial institutions are now participating in the FICO Score Open Access program. Before I start my prepared remarks, I want to just spend a couple of minutes about my impending retirement. I've spent literally a quarter of my life at FICO, and I'm very proud of what we have accomplished. For those that know me, you won't be surprised to know that I expect to spend much of my time in retirement, traveling and seeking some new personal adventures, but until then, I will continue to contribute my best to the success of the company. Now, let me move on to my prepared remarks. First, I'd like to remind everyone that this is our first quarter reporting under the new accounting standard Topic 606, and all comparisons will be made to previous quarters as they've been adjusted under that standard. Today, I'll emphasize three points in my prepared comments.  First, we delivered 262 million of revenue, an increase of $30 million or 13% over prior year. Recurring revenue grew 14% and totaled 194 million. Second, we delivered 40 million of GAAP net income and $1.32 of GAAP EPS, up 22% and 27% versus last year. And finally, we generated $42 million of free cash flow this quarter and we used $83 million to repurchase shares in our first quarter. Let me break the revenue down now into our three reporting segments. Starting with applications, revenues were $148 million, up 5% versus the same period last year. Recurring revenue grew 7% over last year and accounts for about two-thirds of all applications revenue. We had particularly strong quarters in fraud banking solutions and in our compliance solutions. And our application bookings of 59 million were down slightly from the $62 million in the prior year. In decision management software segments, revenue were 29 million or up 22% versus the prior year, due to increases in upfront license and an 8% increase in recurring revenue. We had our largest DMS bookings quarter ever with $31 million of new deals, which is up 169% from last year. And finally in our Scores segment, revenues were $86 million, up 25% from the same period last year. On the B2B side, we’re up 36% versus the same period a year ago. B2C revenues were up 9% from the same quarter last year. In B2C, revenues from our partners were up double-digit, while our myFICO revenues were relatively flat. Looking at revenue by region, this quarter 77% of total revenues were derived from the Americas. Our EMEA region generated 15% and the remaining 8% was from Asia Pacific. Recurring revenues, which are derived from transactional and maintenance sources remained very strong and this quarter represented 74% of total revenue. License revenues were 10% of total and consulting and implementation revenues were 16% of total. The lower percentage of services revenue was primarily caused by some implementation delays over the holidays. Bookings this quarter were $107 million, up 30% from the prior year quarter. Total bookings for the trailing four quarters is $462 million. We generated $16 million of current period revenues on those bookings for a yield of 15% and the weighted average term for our bookings was 31 months this quarter. This quarter, we had 16 deals between $1 million and $3 million and we booked seven deals over 3 million. Cloud bookings represented $44 million of the total, which is up 134% from last year. In addition for the first time, the cloud deals represented a majority of our deals in excess of the $1 million I noted above. Operating expenses were 213 million this quarter, compared to 209 million in the fourth quarter and this quarter included our annual salary and benefit increases. As you can see in our Reg G schedule, our non-GAAP operating margin was 28% for the first quarter versus 24% last year. We expect that net operating margin to be between 26.5% and 28.5% for the full year.  GAAP net income this quarter was 40 million. We had a reduction to income tax of 13.2 million or $0.44 per share associated with the excess tax benefits and had an effective tax rate of negative 8%. Tax reform guidance continues to evolve, but as we have said last quarter, we expect our effective tax rate to be around 14% for the fiscal year. Non-GAAP net income was 44 million, which is up 13% from last year. Our free cash flow for the quarter was 42 million versus 25 million last year and free cash flow for the trailing four quarters is about 209 million. Now turning to the balance sheet, we had $80 million of cash on hand at the end of the quarter. Our total debt is 838 million with a weighted average interest rate of 4.7%. The ratio of our total debt to adjusted EBITDA this quarter is 2.7 times, which is below our covenant level of 3 times. The increase from prior quarter is a result of additional borrowings plus the fiscal 2018 impact related to the new accounting standards. During the quarter, we returned $83 million in excess cash to our investors and repurchased 425,000 shares at an average price of about $195. We have about 117 million remaining on our board authorization and continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. We also continue to actively evaluate opportunities to acquire relevant technologies and products that advance our strategy or strengthen our portfolio and competitive position. And finally, we're confirming our previously issued full year guidance. With that, I'll turn the call back to Steve for Q&A.
Steve Weber: Thanks, Mike. This concludes our prepared remarks and we're now ready to take your questions. Operator, please open the lines.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays.
Manav Patnaik: Hi. Good evening, gentlemen. And Mike, before we begin, just congratulations on your retirement.
Mike Pung: Thanks, Manav.
Manav Patnaik: The first question I had was just on the B2B Scores side, the plus 36%. I was hoping you could just help us flesh out what the pricing versus volume component of that was?
Mike Pung: Yes. Absolutely, Manav. So our fourth quarter or our first quarter, which ends December tends to be a lighter quarter for us in terms of volume. Volume levels were up in the low single-digits for the quarter with the remainder of the increase made up primarily from pricing in the US as well as B2B Scores that we sold outside of the US, primarily in China.
Manav Patnaik: Okay. And if I heard you correctly, did you say you put in new pricing in January of, like this year?
Mike Pung: That's correct. Similar to last year, when we put our pricing sheets forward, they effectively take effect as of January 1, though they obviously feather in over the course of the year as our resellers reset their price sheets as well.
Manav Patnaik: And could you give just any color on where those price increase are? And I guess it sounds like you haven't baked that into your guidance. Is that correct?
Mike Pung: That's correct. When we built the guidance in November and communicated it to all of you, we were fairly clear that we had built in general increases in our pricing and any special pricing increases that would take effect have not been included in any of the guidance, simply because it's very hard to predict the timing of when those price sheets will become applicable through our reseller networks.
Manav Patnaik: Okay. Got it. And then just maybe just some general color, whether it's on your software or maybe in the Scores, everyone's obviously a little shaky on where the economy is, just any data points you're seeing that makes you think differently than when we last spoke.
Mike Pung: No. We don't really have any clear signals despite the fact that the last 30 to 40 days have been relatively choppy, especially with the shutdown of the government. Our pipeline remains strong, our ability to convert still exists. We haven't frankly seen any changes in customer behavior. And so things are quite similar to what they were in November when we last had these formal discussions.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo.
Bill Warmington: So Mike, I'm happy for you personally, but I think, I'm going to miss you professionally, so that’s sad news there. So I have to conclude that it was the 606 Topic that pushed you over the edge.
Mike Pung: That's been known to take down many, much greater than me, Bill. Thank you.
Bill Warmington: A couple of things. First is, you mentioned a couple of the big Falcon contracts that you landed in the quarter and that was a little surprising to me, because I know you've got Falcon X coming out later in the year. So were these actually Falcon X sales, were these like the legacy Falcon product and is there some backward compatibility, are you sort of selling in advance on that? I almost would expect to be some slowdown in Falcon in advance with the Falcon X coming out?
Mike Pung: No. That's a great question, Bill. Falcon X has still not been released. We're still in development and we will be over the next quarter or so. The deals that I referred to are existing Falcon product and they were in the cloud. As you know, we released a cloud version of Falcon a few quarters back and two of our deals this quarter in Latin America were Falcon cloud and as a matter of fact, one of the deals in addition to those were with our new Strategy Director in the cloud also. And so, that product, Falcon and Strategy Director are ready for prime time. There's obviously upgrade paths down the road, but these deals have been in the works for a while and they got converted here this quarter.
Bill Warmington: Okay. Now you mentioned that new B2C contract, we happened to notice that USAA put out a blurb to their customer base about offering that score, so we're concluding that those are the players. Is that revenue then going to be effective this quarter, the January quarter or is it, was there some in the December quarter?
Mike Pung: Yeah, that's exactly right, Bill. USAA has been a long and an important user of the FICO score for their credit risk management, and they announced in January that they would be distributing that score in multiple programs to their end customer, similar to what our open access, educational programs and lead generation programs are. They are paid to FICO and our partner Experian as a result of that and we'll start to see some of that revenue begin to flow here in January, when they launch their service.
Bill Warmington: Okay. And then Experian on their update that they gave earlier in the month mentioned a couple of things. They talked about their Boost program and they also talked about their credit match program and those seemed like both like programs that you guys are participating in, maybe you could give us some update on those, and how you fit into each one of those?
Mike Pung: Yeah. I'll be happy to. Their credit match program is obviously their lead generation program here that they launched over prior year and a half ago with us in partnership. They're beginning to build, as I understand, through their call, a lot of momentum around building their pre-subscriber base. And some of the growth that you see coming through our consumer channel is frankly coming through that channel as well. The Boost program is a program that they’ve launched, I believe it's this month and it works in coordination with the announcement that we made several quarters ago on UltraFICO, I guess it was last quarter. And we're also working in coordination with Experian under our joint program.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Adam Klauber from William Blair.
Adam Klauber: Couple of different questions. Follow-up on the Scores price increases. What products are those on? And if you can give us some idea of the -- are they in the magnitude of what we saw on the mortgage product?
Mike Pung: Yeah. Great question, Adam. So we've done two different kind of pricing actions this year, similar to what we did last year. The first was a more general CPI, I would call it price increase that touches on a number of different parts of the portfolio. That takes effect essentially in January. And then, we have done another special pricing increase to an area, not mortgage, we did the mortgage catch-up, if you will last year and we're touching another area within the portfolio that we have not done any pricing increases on for decades, beginning in January as well. We've not specified yet what part of the portfolio that's in and we likely won't speak to it until we start to see some of the revenue be generated from that. We purposely have left that off to the side of our internal plans and in our guidance, because any special pricing that we do through the re-seller channel we have with the bureaus has to be implemented by the bureaus to their end-customer and their re-seller channels. And the timing of how that all flows through is often a bit uncertain depending upon their existing agreements in place. And as a reminder when our bureau partners have a deal in place that is locked in a pricing deal, we honor that price and we grandfather it. So, we'll start to see reports that will come back for all of these pricing decisions, probably beginning sometime in February and March and we should have a better handle on how it's all rolling out on our next call.
Adam Klauber: Okay. That's actually very helpful. Then, I think you mentioned in applications, there are some implementations pushed. Can you give us an idea of how big or how much revenue that would be? And can we expect that to flow into the next quarter?
Mike Pung: Yeah. So good question, so when you step back and look at our results, the one thing you may notice when you look at it by type of revenue stream, you'll see that our services revenue went down slightly, compared to last year in the first quarter, which is a bit unusual, because we've booked a significant amount of services business over the course of the last 12 months. Because of the holidays and because of other situations at some of our customers, the pace at which some of these programs are beginning the implementation process have just simply gotten slowed down. And that's really why the services revenue was a little bit below what we'd seen in the past. In terms of giving you an order of magnitude of size, I would say it's probably in the range of something around $5 million of revenue that we typically would have seen had these deals kind of gone up and running in the holiday seasons. And so because they haven't, it just simply gets pushed out into quarter two and possibly some will push into quarter three.
Adam Klauber: Great, great. And then Brazil seems like it's beginning to take off. How big is that business and how should we think about that growing and emerging over the next couple of years?
Mike Pung: Yeah. So that's a great question, we don't often talk about the activity that we have down in Brazil and frankly in all of Latin America, it gets blended into our North America book of business typically. But we do close to $80 million to $90 million worth of business in Latin America on an annual basis. Actually, I take that back, it's about 50 million of annual business down in Latin America.  This quarter, we had a tremendous quarter, primarily in the bookings area where we signed a lot of business. What we've seen from the team down there, I would say they're almost the poster child of software sales people, who are very good at selling our decision management platform and all the solutions that are tied and associated to that. And that's what's really been driving a lot of the success. The challenge in Latin America for us is that there are a lot of kind of boutique players down there and so it's very competitive country by country. But we're beginning to find a very nice niche for ourselves with a couple of our products. Falcon is one that has been selling for a while very nicely there and then more importantly to us, the DMP -- or equally important, the DMP has been selling well in part because of the talent we have there on the ground.
Adam Klauber: Okay, okay. And then last question the FICO Ultra, will revenue from that be incremental this year, is that just building for maybe down the road?
Mike Pung: Yeah, I would call UltraFICO something more down the road. As we mentioned in the last call, it's a new initiative that we are partnering with Experian on. There's a lot of work ahead of us still to operationalize it. We've made some progress this quarter. And with the holidays, it's actually gone fairly well, but we don't have anything baked into any of our numbers in fiscal ‘19 related to UltraFICO. We'll see how the implementation and the product development work concludes before we get more specific on that one.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time.
Steve Weber: All right. That concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining us and we'll talk to you again next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

===== 2018 Q4  (2018-11-03 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Steve Weber - Vice President of Investor Relations Will Lansing - Chief Executive Officer Mike Pung - Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: Greg Bardi - Barclays Bill Warmington - Wells Fargo Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc. Adam Klaub - William Blair
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Fair Isaac Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, November 1, 2018. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Steve Weber. Please go ahead.
Steve Weber: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining FICO's fourth quarter earnings call. I'm Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations and I'm joined today by Will Lansing, our CEO; and Mike Pung, our CFO. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular in the risk factors and forward-looking statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO Web site or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's Web site at fico.com or on the SEC's Web site at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through November 1, 2019. And now, I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
Will Lansing: Thanks, Steve, and thank you everyone for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. Today we reported the results of a strong fourth quarter with record revenue and earnings and have finished a year in which we topped $1 billion in revenue for the first time. In our fourth quarter, we reported revenues of $280 million, an increase of more than 10% over the same period last year. For the full fiscal year, we recorded $1,032 million of revenue, up 11% from 2017. We delivered $50 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of a $1.64 per share. Results that included a number of one-time puts and takes that Mike will describe. On a non-GAAP basis for the $1.89 earnings per share was up 14% from last year. Now we were able to drive this growth, as we continue our shift to the cloud. In our software business, we were able to grow revenues by 4% for the full year, even as up front license sales were down 10%. This was possible because the significant bookings we've been reporting led to an increase in recurring revenues of 9% in software. We had a strong year with our compliance, customer communications, originations and customer management solutions. We're seeing opportunities with these solutions and areas we haven't served in the past. In many cases, because the cloud-enabled solutions are increasing our addressable market, these solutions have been refreshed over the last few years and are now driving growth. Strategy Director for instance is a product, we introduced in fiscal '18 in the customer management space. It's generating a lot of customer interest and we're already closing deals as we build out a healthy pipeline of potential deals. We are committed to our cloud first strategy. We now have an incredible suite of products and our decisioning solutions are proving their value to customers every day. Those solutions are drawing interest from new customers and also from industry analysts. Forrester recently evaluated and ranked the top 11 participants in the decisioning platform market. Each competitor was evaluated on 10 criteria. FICO was recognized as a leader and received the highest possible marks in six of those criteria. Forrester selection of FICO as its top vendor of choice is a strong validation of the Decision Management Suite vision, development and direction. It confirms the technological and business vision we've been advocating for our customers for many years, long before most of our competitors. We're happy to be recognized for our innovation but were happier when we see market demand for that innovation. And we are seeing that demand turn into sales. Our cloud revenues were up 19% in fiscal '18 and our cloud bookings were up 47%, which means we're building more backlog as we head into 2019. In our scores business, we had another very successful year. Scores were up 29% in the fourth quarter versus the prior year and also up 29% for the full year. We continue to see positive volume trends and B2B, which is up 38% over the previous year, as well as the effects of our repricing efforts. For the full year, B2B revenues were up 36%. Our B2C revenues were up 12% versus the previous year and were up 16% for the full year. We continue to see positive trends as we look forward. In next year's guidance which I discuss later, we expect this score business to grow nearly 10%, which includes some volume and regular pricing increases, but does not include any special pricing increases. We will be implementing some special pricing, but like last year because it's difficult to estimate the timing and the magnitude we are not including it in our guidance. As we look to 2019, we're excited about the many opportunities ahead for us and the innovation we're driving. One such initiative is the UltraFICO score, which we announced last month. FICO along with our partners Experian and Finicity are first to market with a score based on consumer contributed DDA data, which empowers consumers to engage and have more control in the credit scoring process. This score also enables lenders to shift the customer dialogue from a no into tell us more about yourself and let's see if we can get you qualified for a yes or for better terms. This approach drastically changes the broader consumer lending system, benefiting consumers and lenders alike. With UltraFICO score, consumer grants permission to contribute information from banking statements, including the length of time accounts have been opened, frequency of activity, and evidence of saving, which can be electronically read by Finicity and combined with consumer credit information from Experian to provide an enhanced view of positive financial behavior. We estimate this new score has the potential to improve credit access for the majority of Americans and is particularly relevant for those who fall in the gray area in terms of credit scores or it fall just below lenders score cutoffs. While, there's still a lot of work ahead to operationalize this offering, we're very excited about its prospects and look forward to discussing the progress throughout fiscal 2019. As we move into 2019, we remain focused on executing against our opportunities. We'll continue to prioritize areas where we see the greatest growth potential. And we'll continue on providing long-term shareholder value. In fiscal '18, we generated $192 million in free cash flow and spent that and more retiring 1.9 million shares. We are extremely well-positioned as we enter a new fiscal year and we look forward to delivering on those opportunities and reporting on our progress. I'll talk more about our outlook for 2019. But first, let me turn the call over to Mike for further financial details.
Mike Pung: Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. Today I will emphasize three points in my prepared comments. First, we delivered $280 million of revenue this quarter and $1032 million for the year, which is an increase of $100 million from last year. Our recurring revenue grew 17% from last year. Second, we delivered a $1.64 per share of EPS this quarter and $4.57 per share for the year, up 31% and 15% respectively. Finally, we delivered $53 million of free cash flow in the quarter and $192 million for the fiscal year. We repurchased 1.9 million shares during the year or 6% of our outstanding shares. I'll begin by reviewing the results in each of our three reporting segments. Our applications revenue were $156 million, up 10% from last quarter and up 4% versus the same period last year. Full year revenues for applications were $586 million, or up 6% from last year. The increase in revenue was driven from our recurring businesses, as our licensed revenues for the year were down slightly. We had particularly a strong year in compliance, originations and customer management solutions. In our Decision Management Software segment, revenues were $31 million, up 21% from last quarter and flat with the same period last year. Full year DMS revenues were $104 million, down 7% from last year due to the shipment in business model away from upfront licenses. DMS bookings were $24 million this quarter, up 11% from the previous year. And finally, our score segment's revenues were $93 million, up 1% from last quarter and up 29% from the same period last year. B2B was up 38% over the same period last year and B2C revenues were up 12% from the same period last year. For the full year, scores revenues were $343 million or up 29% from last year. Looking at our revenue by region, this quarter 76% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region. Our EMEA region generated 16% and the remaining 8% was from Asia-Pacific. Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter represented 72% of total revenue, consulting an implementation revenues were 16% in total and license revenues were 12%. For the full year, 74% of our revenues were recurring compared to 70% last year. Our cloud revenue topped $242 million for the year, which is up 19% from the prior year. We generated $15 million of current period revenue on booking of $134 million and 11% yield. The reduced yield is due to an increase in cloud bookings and essentially means that more of the revenue will be recurring. It was our second highest bookings quarter ever in the third straight quarter above a $100 million. The weighted average term for our bookings was 31 months this quarter. For the full year, bookings were $437 million, up 2% from the prior year. Cloud bookings though were $151 million for the year, which is up 47% from the prior year. Our operating expenses totaled $210 million this quarter, which is down $1 million from last quarter. And as you can see in our Reg G schedule, non-GAAP operating margin was 33% for the quarter and 28% for the full year. We delivered margin expansion of 50 basis points for the full fiscal year. We expect the operating margin will be between 27% to 29% in 2019. GAAP net income this quarter was $50 million, which is up 26% from the prior year. The current quarter net income includes a pre-tax non-operating gain of $10 million or $0.23 per share after tax related to the divestiture of a minority interest investment. In addition, the company recorded an additional charge of $6.8 million or $0.22 per share related to the Tax Cuts and Job Act. This charge encompasses the impact of recently issued tax reform guidance. Our non-GAAP net income was $58 million for the quarter, up 10% from last year. For the full year, net income was $142 million, including $22 million in reduced tax from excess tax benefits and also included $22 million in charges related to the Tax Cut and Jobs Act. Non-GAAP net income was $194 million, which is up 23% from the prior year. Our effective tax rate for the full year was 24%. We expect our 2019 recurring tax rate to be around 26% to 27% before the excess tax benefit of an estimated $25 million, which resulted in a net effective tax rate of about 14%. Free cash flow for the quarter was $53 million, compared to $49 million in the same period last year. And for the full year, free cash flow was $192 million compared to $205 million last year. Looking at the balance sheet. We had $90 million in cash on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. It's down $30 million from last quarter due to share repurchases, partially offset by cash generated from operations. Our total debt is $770 million with a weighted average interest rate of 4.7%, and our ratio of total net debt to adjusted EBITDA is 2.3x. We bought back 502,000 shares in the fourth quarter at an average price of $210. And in fiscal 2018, we repurchased a total of 1.9 million shares at an average price of $181 million, for a total of about $337 million. At the end of September, we had $200 million remaining on the board authorization and we continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. We also continue to actively evaluate opportunities to acquire relevant technologies and products that advance our strategy or strengthen our portfolio on competitive position. So with that I'll turn it back to Will for his thoughts on next year.
Will Lansing: Thanks, Mike. As I said, I'm proud of our results to-date and I'm excited about our prospects for 2019 and beyond. On the software side, we're making steady progress with our cloud first strategy and we're seeing growth in our revenue, our pipeline and our backlog. Like last year a strong software bookings give us more visibility into future revenues, that predictable, reliable backlog continues to build as we put more customers into the cloud. In scores, we're finding new ways to extract even more value out of that incredible franchise through increased usage, repricing and innovation. With all this in mind, we're providing the following guidance for fiscal '19. We are guiding revenues of approximately $1,125 million, an increase of about 9% versus fiscal '18. We are guiding GAAP net income of approximately $168 million, up 18% over 2018. GAAP earnings per share of approximately $5.53, non-GAAP net income of $209 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $6.88. I'll now turn the call back to Steve for Q&A.
Steve Weber: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks and we're now ready to take your questions. Operator, please open the line.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] First question is from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Greg Bardi: Hi, this is actually Greg calling on for Manav. Just wanted to ask about the software business growth implied in the 2019 guidance. I think you said scores is expect to be up 10%, which implies a decent acceleration on the software business. So maybe just walk us through the moving pieces there please?
Mike Pung: Yes. Greg, the software business, right now we're expecting to grow somewhere around the 9% range with a similar mix that we had this year meaning our cloud business is growing roughly at a 20% rate and are on-prem legacy business is modestly up in the 2% to 3% range. As it relates to scores, both B2B and B2C are roughly growing between 9% to 10%.
Greg Bardi: Okay. Maybe on the B2B or B2C, scores business. Can you just talk through how you guys are thinking about the ability to continue to grow that business in that high single-digit, low double-digit range and what's going to drive that going forward?
Mike Pung: Yes, sure. I'll start and let Will finish. A lot of the growth that we've built into the guidance number is frankly coming from deals that we have signed this year that have not gone live yet. So similar to what we did in this past year's guidance, we take a look at volume growth both on myFICO which we see growing in the mid-single digits and on our partner programs which have been growing obviously faster than that. And based upon that in the growth of what we've already signed in the pipeline, we're comfortable with the numbers that we included here in.
Greg Bardi: Okay. And last one from me. Maybe on the margins I guess at the mid point implies roughly flat. Can you just walk us through the areas of investment focus this year versus last year? Thanks.
Mike Pung: Yes. I would say the investment focus is the same as what we had last year. There are no real new items that we are putting money into it. It's been a combination for the last couple of years of operations, network security and some sales and distribution. We provide obviously a big range in terms of margin outcomes because it's really highly dependent upon how we end-up with a mix of revenue is it, license revenue that comes at a 100% margin or is it more heavily skewed toward cloud revenue, which is ratable and the revenue and expenses don't necessarily match up all that cleanly. There's a little bit of noise in there related to the new revenue standard, which we have to implement here effective October 1, but even if you put that on the side, we saw basis growth of 50% on our -- our 50 basis points on our margin this year and we're looking at something quite similar for fiscal '19 again dependent upon the mix.
Operator: So our next question comes from Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. The line is open.
Bill Warmington: Good afternoon, everyone. I was hoping you could give us some strength -- sorry, you could give us some color on the strength in CCS and the customer management solutions in the banking fraud that you referenced in the release?
Will Lansing: Yes, absolutely. So our top performing products are the three of course that we mentioned. CCS is still growing in the teens. It's a volume driven business based upon deals that we signed, bookings that we signed and getting those bookings up and live. We have a very strong pipeline in CCS to go on top of the existing recurring revenue base. Our revenue for the year for that product line was somewhere around $109 million, $110 million again, growing in the teens. Customer management are really -- the new Strategy Director product is just starting to pick up for us. Last quarter, quarter three, we signed [indiscernible] deals in excess of $1 million, we signed another one over $3 million this quarter and the pipeline for that is big and growing. I would say on our collections and recovery product, which we didn't mention that's becoming the new engine around cloud, and in fact of all the application products we have our collections and recovery bookings were the largest across the entire portfolio and the entirety of it almost was cloud related. So deals that we signed and booked in fiscal '18, but really the revenue hasn't been recognized yet, it will start to flow in fiscal '19 and it's part of what provides us with the optimistic view of a high-single digit close to 10% growth in the software side. So, there's nothing new to this story other than we're executing very well on the pipeline. We're winning a lot of deals, many of them are cloud. And they help us enter fiscal '19 with a greater run rate certainly than what we had when we entered fiscal '18.
Bill Warmington: So I had a question for you on the score side, you mentioned, a lot of visibility you have into 2019 is based on deals signed in 2018. Are there some deals there that you guys maybe haven't discussed? I'd say maybe give a little color on what's actually in that pipeline of deals that you guys have signed or is just giving the visibility into score's?
Will Lansing: Yes. My comment was specifically on the consumer side and it relates primarily to some smaller deals that we have signed with some existing resellers some expansions if you will. It also includes some deals that we have not announced yet, but we are in the process of wrapping up this quarter and will begin to go live at some point. We believe in our first quarter of fiscal '19. So most of them are already in the bag, but some of them are very close to that.
Bill Warmington: Got it. And so with the growth in score's, which has very high incremental margins and the relatively limited margin expansion that's in the guidance for next year that would imply that there's a lot of investment going into, I would assume the software business. And maybe you could talk a little bit about what that is, where that's going and I guess, the timeframe for when you think you're going to get some leverage on that business and start to see the margins in the software business expand.
Will Lansing: Bill, that's right that we are continuing to invest in the business and the things we're spending the money on have not changed much from last year. We're very focused on improving our operations, our network operations are cloud infrastructure, the signaling and alerting, all of the things that you have to wrap that kind of an offering with. And we're getting better and better every day. And I think you have to recognize where we started as we made our transition to the cloud. We started with a lift and shift strategy, we literally took our on-premise software that we -- and put it into our own data centers and then provided it as cloud service. But we had now for several years been in this transition to more standardize, highly configurable, multi-tenant kind of a code base. And in words, we have a lot of progress on that front, but we're not finished, we probably won't be finished a year from now either. I mean I think there's still work to be done. That said we do have a lot of control over the R&D dollars that we spend. And we like to spend them holding software margin more or less flat because we think the opportunity is so great. We think we're in a little bit of a land grab. You saw in the Forrester report that we are on the leading edge for analytics platforms and decisioning platforms and it's a commanding lead that we want to maintain. And so I think you're going to continue to see a year or two of investment at this level.
Bill Warmington: Got it. And then I have to ask about the UltraFICO score. Is that have been adopted or in beta with any clients and how long do you think it will be before you actually start to see it rolled out commercially?
Will Lansing: Yes. Thanks for asking the question. We are extremely excited about UltraFICO and for the benefit of those not so familiar and we had a lot of fanfare over the announcement last week at Money 20/20. Bringing consumer data to the equation is attractive to regulators, attractive to lenders and attractive to consumers. And giving consumers the opportunity to improve their FICO score is a huge deal. And so the value proposition is strong. Operationally, it's not simple. I mean, we're working closely with our partners Experian and Finicity to make this a reality and it will be operational in 2019. We have some pilot clients already lined up. And I think we'd be prepared to take one or two more. And we're feeling pretty good about it. I mean we'll see what the uptake is once it's out there.
Bill Warmington: Well. Thank you very much.
Will Lansing: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Brett Huff with Stephens. Please go ahead.
Brett Huff: Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions. I think you guys mentioned the B2B pricing that was normal in '19 kind of like normal tweaking and things like that. And then, you gave us some volume views, but Will I think you said that there could be another sort of not typical price increase, but you're not including that in guidance just because you're not sure kind of if or when. First of all, that I hear that right and any more color on that would be helpful.
Will Lansing: Yes. So, I think the way to think about our business is that we have kind of ordinary course price increases that are probably a little more than inflation. And then, we have all of the volume expansion kinds of initiatives that go on. And what's not included is the impact of what we call a special pricing situations and what that really is a recognition that in some segments where we haven't changed pricing in many, many years, that there's an opportunity to move more than 5% or 7%. And so, we don't have the timing of it, completely lined up. It's not completely in our control. It's a function of the length of contracts that our bureau partners have with their customers. And so, we're not really in a position to say it's going to be dollars X in 2019. What we do know is that there's some of these opportunities and we'll be working on them.
Brett Huff: All right. That's helpful. And then, when you guys think about the investments, I know that a lot of it is around the cloud infrastructure. As I recall the network security was sort of a general, you just making sure you have capacity and make sure that the security is upgraded. But then, the results are some specific development associated with the cloud products that I know you're replatforming some of your old products and building some of the new. Is that investment kind of split evenly or is there an emphasis on one or the other or is there -- how should we think about that investment?
Mike Pung: Yes. So Brett, this is Mike. I would say, the majority of the spend around the cloud is spent on development. There's one big kind of project we're working on right now, we plan to deliver in fiscal '19. And it's a successor product to our Falcon product along with a combination of our anti-money laundering and compliance products. So it's basically --, and said in another way, we're using the decision management platform to bring out the next generation of Falcon, which will have a lot more capability on it. So that's a pretty big undertaking that was started this last year and flows a little bit into '19. But that being said on the operations side, if you think about it our cloud bookings are growing 50% almost year-over-year, which means we have lots of customers to stand up and lots of demands on the operations side of our business. Last year, we built out a network operation center that operates 7/24 worldwide. And we don't have a lot of incremental investments around that, but obviously as volume goes up there is some element of additional investment that goes along with the volume. And when the volume is booked, it doesn't get claimed as revenue, but for a period of two to three years. So there's this mismatch that happens with all cloud companies including our own around that. I would say this year, we don't have any step function investments and our numbers are planned, but it will all be depending upon the continued demand for the cloud product.
Will Lansing: I would add a couple of things. I'd say that we have a lot of dedicated security spending under the very capable leadership of our CISO, Hilik Kotler and that continues and we're pretty happy with where that stands. Beyond that I think that we've got a lot of initiative from Hilik and from Claus Moldt, our CIO to move to a more of a [indiscernible] ops model. And I think that's the new gold standard in non-develop software and so we are very much adopting that. You'll see security built into all of our products from the get-go not added as an afterthought. So that -- so some of the security dollars are actually being spent in development.
Brett Huff: Okay. And then last question for me is just a guidance question. I want to make sure, I got the tax benefit, in the pro forma EPS you gave us that does not include the $0.82 tax benefit. And can you just describe what that benefit is? So that we know if we think it's kind of a one timer or if it's a normal course of business kind of thing? I want to make sure I understand what that was as you called it out.
Will Lansing: Yes. So think about our income tax, it's two separate pieces that net to what we report, okay. The first piece of the two are just the normal recurring tax rate in accordance with worldwide tax rules. That's the 26% or 27% rate that we see worldwide. There is a offset to that number, which basically decreases tax expense. That's been around for a couple of years called excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation. In the past, as you may recall that used to flow through equity beginning last year it began to flow through income tax expense. That's the $25 million or $0.82 a share benefit that offsets that 26% to 27% cost. The net of all that which is what we report on the phase of the income statement, we believe is going to be around 14%. So for simplicity, when you're modeling, your tax rate for us take pre-tax net income and multiplied by 14% and that's roughly what we believe our tax expense will be for the year.
Brett Huff: Okay. And comparability to the number we just reported on a pro forma basis I can't remember what it was for the year. Which is the most comparable number the guided 688 or should we add that $0.82 to get I think it was 770, which one of those two is more comparable to the number that you guys just reported from a pro forma EPS point of view?
Will Lansing: Yes. So to further complicate the tax expense that we recorded on the phase of the income statement this year was around 27%. If we were to have excluded the one-time costs that we had in fiscal '18 to implement tax reform, it would have been around 14%, which is about what we're guiding next year. So in fiscal '18, we had a charge, the income statement by over $22 million for the total tax charge in the recalculation of the deferred tax assets we had on the balance sheet. So that's just yet one more piece of noise if you will on the tax rate, but if you separate it all out, the reported rate was 27% in '18, it's going to go down to 14% in fiscal '19. And if you want to make it apples in apples and pull out the one-timer in fiscal '18 it's roughly the same 14% for both years. I hope that helps.
Brett Huff: That is helpful. And then going forward is the -- do you guys sort of see that tax floating -- if you look at the 14%, does that slowly deteriorate or I guess get less favorable and go back get up to the mid-20s, or does it stay kind of at 14% for the long term. I'm just trying to make sure I get the cash flows right?
Will Lansing: At this point, our long-term models, we keep it pretty static. But the benefit that I described the excess tax benefit will go up and down depending upon our stock price. And so, once you've got that figured out then you'll have the model completely figured out for the next five years. So for our benefit, we just kind of hold it static, so that we aren't introducing yet another variable that confuses this already confusing area.
Brett Huff: So that's why, so the static is sort of that mid-to-high 20%, I think you said, 25%, 26%, 27% that's a better place to start and then sometimes you get more benefit than not from the additional tax pay. Okay, Sorry to ask so many questions, just wanted to make sure we got it. I just wanted to make sure, we got that.
Will Lansing: Nope, you figure it out.
Brett Huff: All right.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Next question is from Adam Klaub with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Adam Klaub: Hi, guys. Good afternoon.
Will Lansing: Hi, Adam.
Adam Klaub: In scores B2B, if you include the price increase and mortgage, what would have been the growth rate this year?
Will Lansing: Well, we don't really break that out, the majority of that growth rate of course came from the mortgage repricing, but we did see volume increases I'd say in the mid-to-higher single-digits, higher single-digits to the beginning of the year and it tapered off a bit toward the end though the fourth quarter was quite strong volume wise.
Adam Klaub: Okay. And then as far as the guidance next year, what are you assuming for just the volume is that low mid-single-digits for next year?
Will Lansing: Yes. It's a great question. So you're absolutely right. We have one more quarter worth of price increase for mortgage that shows up here in quarter one. And then, it becomes apples-and-apples beginning January 1, with last year. So a part of the growth is the fact that we have mortgage for four full quarters in '19 versus three in '18. And then, the rest of it is related to volume growth or little bit in the U.S., but some outside the U.S. in particular in our China market.
Adam Klaub: Okay. [Indiscernible] team as and you may have said this, but do you think most of the transition is over at this point? And should we see growth -- revenue growth in that segment next year?
Will Lansing: I think we've said before that trying to distinguish between DMS and the rest of our applications business is a hard thing to do because it's the same IP that underlies the solutions, as well as the platform. And so it's a little bit of an artifact that the DMS numbers look the way they do. And I don't think it's particularly useful to look at the growth rate in that alone. I really got to look at on combined basis.
Adam Klaub: Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then, as far as the nature of the bookings, how is the -- how the amount of $1 million, $3 million plus deals compared to year ago?
Will Lansing: Yes. For the fourth quarter, we had slightly fewer than last year because we had a record fourth quarter last year. Our bookings were 146, this year they were 134. So it included a couple of additional deals last year. For the full year, I'm just looking at the numbers now. It was pretty comparable fiscal '18 versus fiscal '17 for deals in excess of $1 million and in excess of $3 million. So let's call it, about the same amount as last year.
Adam Klaub: Okay. And how about the -- again that's the rough breakdown versus existing verticals -- your existing core financial versus non-financial verticals? Has that been around the same too?
Will Lansing: Yes. It's of course heavily weighted on financial services.
Adam Klaub: Okay. Thanks a lot. That's helpful.
Operator: No further questions at this time.
Will Lansing: All right. That concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining.
Operator: So ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. And you may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2018 Q3  (2018-07-26 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Steven P. Weber - Fair Isaac Corp. William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp. Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.
Analysts: Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc. Blake Anderson - Stephens, Inc. William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Fair Isaac Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. And afterwards, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded Thursday, July 26, 2018. And now I'd like to turn the conference over to Steve Weber. Please go ahead.
Steven P. Weber - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining FICO's third quarter earnings call. I'm Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike Pung. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate an understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular in the Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through July 26, 2019. And now I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thank you, everyone, for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. We delivered another very strong quarter. In fact, we had record revenue for the second straight quarter, and that even as we're transitioning our business model from upfront license revenue to a recurring revenue base. We also had a very good bookings quarter and continue to build an increasing backlog of predictable recurring revenue. In our third quarter, we reported revenues of $260 million, an increase of 12% over the same period last year. We delivered $32 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $1.04 per share. We delivered $47 million of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS of $1.51. As we've been saying, we've been able to deliver growth even as we shift our business. It's easy to see how this transition is playing out in our revenues and also in our bookings. This quarter, we signed $120 million of bookings, up 26% over last year. Digging deeper into those bookings, our upfront license sales were actually down 24% and our transactional bookings were up a whopping 44%. Those represent revenues that are yet to be recognized and that will be recurring revenues well into the future, and it's a model we're putting in place across all of our segments. In Applications, revenues were up 6% over the prior year and 7% year-to-date. Our TONBELLER Compliance Solutions and our Origination Solutions were particularly strong, up 55% and 11% respectively from last year. We also signed many Applications deals this quarter, many of which have been due to recent product innovation. Our new Strategy Director, for instance, provides analytically powered decisions across both the customer management and originations life cycles. This new product built on the DMS platform applies optimization technology in real time to deliver faster and easier decisions. It has a significant pipeline, and is being sold to customers and financial services, as well as other industries like telecom. Our recent enhancement of our collections and recovery product has also helped boost sales. Year-to-date, collections and recovery bookings are up 129% over last year, with an increasing number in the cloud. Our total Applications bookings of $82 million were 32% higher than last year and we continue to build recurring revenue streams in this segment. In our Decision Management Software segment, we continue to have near-term revenue headwinds as we shift to a recurring revenue model. This quarter upfront licenses were down 36% from last year, which caused total revenues to be down about 7%. As we've explained, we're now selling these in the cloud, either our own psychoanalytic cloud or on AWS, and it results in increased recurring revenue which we're now building in backlog. And we're seeing proof of demand in our bookings. In fact, this quarter DMS bookings were up 27% over last year and 38% over last quarter, making it the biggest ever bookings quarter in the segment. In the Scores business, we had another great quarter with revenues up 32% versus the prior year and up 29% year-to-date. On the B2B side, revenues were up 42% over the same period as last year. Similar to last quarter, this was driven partly by increased originations and account management volumes as well as targeted price increases. We continue to see strength in the Scores segment and expect it to continue to perform well. B2C revenues were up 15% this quarter and 18% year-to-date. An important innovation in this space is the recently announced FICO Score Planner, a first of its kind tool to empower consumers to use on their financial health journey. The FICO Score Planner enables consumers to set a target FICO Score goal and desired time duration to reach their goal. These inputs, along with the consumers' current FICO Score and credit report, are analyzed by the FICO Score Planner algorithm, which produces a set of personalized potential actions that consumers could take to help reach their target FICO Score goal. Consumers can then track their progress to their goal or modify their goals along the way. FICO is committed to financial inclusion and consumer empowerment. The FICO Score Planner, which is available through lenders and resellers, is an important step in helping consumers understand and improve their access to credit. Finally, we continued to deploy significant resources to our share repurchase program. In the third quarter, we spent $107 million and another $55 million in July for a total this fiscal year of $286 million. We exhausted the 2017 board authorization and today announced a new $250 million share repurchase authorization. I'll share some summary thoughts later, but now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike for further financial details.
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll emphasize three points in my comments. First, we delivered $260 million of revenue, an increase of $29 million or 12% year-over-year. Recurring revenue was $195 million, up 17% from last year, and bookings of $120 million were up 26% from last year. Secondly, we delivered $32 million of GAAP net income, up 28% year-over-year. And finally, we had $72 million of free cash flow this quarter and we spent $107 million of it on repurchasing shares. I'll begin by breaking the revenue down into our three reporting segments. Starting with Applications, revenues were $142 million, up 6% versus the same period last year. We had a strong quarter in compliance with our TONBELLER products and in Originations, with increases in transactional volumes. In Customer Management, we are now beginning to sell our new Strategy Director product and we had three deals over $1 million each this quarter. Our Applications bookings of $82 million is up 32% from last year. In the Decision Management Software segment, revenues were $26 million, down 7% versus the prior year due to the decreased license sales. Recurring revenues in DMS were up 3% from the previous year. Bookings were $27 million, up 27% from last year and 30% over last quarter. And finally, in our Scores segment, revenues were a record $92 million, up 32% from the same period last year. On the B2B side, we're up 42% versus last year and B2C revenues were up 15% versus the same quarter last year. Looking at revenues by region, this quarter 75% of total revenues were derived from the Americas. Our EMEA region generated 15% and the remaining 10% was from Asia-Pacific. Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter represented 75% of total revenues. Consulting and implementation revenues were 17% of total and license revenues were just 8% of total revenue. Our cloud revenues were $58 million this quarter, up 14% from last year. Year-to-date, our cloud revenues are $178 million, which is up 18% from last year. Bookings this quarter were $120 million, or up 26% from the prior year. We generated $17 million of current period revenue on those bookings for a yield of 14%. The weighted average term for our bookings was 28 months this quarter. This quarter we had 15 deals over $1 million and we booked 9 deals over $3 million. Cloud bookings were $44 million this quarter and are $95 million year-to-date, which is up more than 130% from last year. Operating expenses totaled $211 million this quarter, compared to $210 million in the second quarter. We expect to maintain a similar run rate in the fourth quarter, while actively investing our resources in our highest strategic priorities. Our non-GAAP operating margin as shown in our Reg G schedule is 27% for the third quarter and 26% year-to-date. We expect the full-year operating margin will be somewhere around 27% to 28%. GAAP net income this quarter was $32 million and non-GAAP net income was $47 million or $1.51 a share, and our effective tax rate was about 22% this quarter. Free cash flow for the quarter was $72 million versus $67 million in the prior year. And for the trailing 12 months, our free cash flow was $188 million. Now, finally turning to the balance sheet, we had $120 million of cash on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. Our total debt is $765 million with the weighted average interest rate of 4.6%. The ratio of our total net debt to adjusted EBITDA this quarter is 2.34 times, which is below our covenant level of three times. And during the quarter, we issued $400 million of fixed interest notes with an eight-year term. Proceeds were used to repay a maturity on an existing private placement as well as to reduce the amount outstanding on our revolving line of credit. During the quarter, we returned $107 million in excess cash to our investors, repurchasing 563,000 shares at an average price of $189.75. We also purchased an additional $55 million in July, which exhausted the $250 million board authorization from last October. We repurchased more than 1.6 million shares this fiscal year at an average price of just over $175. We announced earlier today that the board has approved a new $250 million authorization and continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. And we also continue to actively evaluate opportunities to acquire relevant technologies and products that advance the strategy or strengthen the portfolio and competitive position. Finally, we are reconfirming our guidance that we updated last quarter with revenue of approximately $1.02 billion, GAAP net income of $140 million, non-GAAP net income of $200 million and non-GAAP EPS of $6.38. With that, I'll turn it back to Will for some final comments.
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thanks, Mike. Next quarter, we'll talk about our expectations and guidance for 2019, but for now I'll say that we're happy with the progress we've made in 2018 and are very bullish on our future prospects. In our software businesses, we've made significant progress on our cloud first analytic forward strategies. We're signing more deals and larger deals and it's showing up in our bookings numbers. And we're seeing the cloud bookings, which have more than doubled in fiscal 2018, beginning to turn into cloud revenues. These recurring revenues give us more visibility to steady sustainable growth than ever before. On the Scores side, we're continually looking for new ways to make the most of this incredible IP asset. On the B2B side, we're working with customers to help them find new ways to use the FICO Score. On the B2C side, we're committed to providing products and services to promote financial inclusion and to help consumers pursue their financial goals. In summary, we're well positioned as we finish up our fiscal year and look to the future. We remain committed to our strategy and are eager to make the most of the many opportunities ahead. Now, I'll turn it back to Steve for Q&A.
Steven P. Weber - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks and we will now take any questions you may have. Operator, please open the lines.
Operator: Thank you. We have a question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Good evening, guys. My first question is maybe we could just revisit the DMS growth profile and how that's changed. Because I think at the beginning of the year, you talked about that should be sort of a low-double-digit kind of growth business, but it's been declining. So can you just help me walk through what changed there, what's going on again?
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: Yeah. Manav, this is Mike. So, really what's happening is the DMP as a standalone segment is becoming a little less relevant to a separate reportable unit for us. Where we are seeing growth from the DMS and the DMP platform is primarily coming off of the products that we have created using the DMS and the DMP, which is our Originations product and our new Strategy Director product. And so, while we're disappointed, I'd say in the standalone performance of the revenue of what we classically call DMS we're very, very happy with the value that we're creating from the investment in the platform itself and it's showing up in terms of benefits in other areas that are probably buried within the Applications business.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So I guess is there – so it sounds like there's a few of those products you talked that are disappointing, but is it being made up for elsewhere or was it the Scores business that's making up for these in terms of your guidance?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: I wouldn't say that we're disappointed. We're not disappointed in any of our products, Manav. Things are actually going quite well, including in DMS. You're getting the shift from license to recurring, so that's part of it. And then, as we've talked about in the past, DMS, it's not a pure thing. It actually underlies so many of our other products, and sometimes it gets sold as DMS and sometimes it gets sold as an application with a different name like Strategy Director or Originations. And so I think we're in pretty good shape there.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then, just on the Scores side, I mean can you just maybe some incremental color on the pricing increases that you had on the mortgage side last quarter? Any increased adoptions? And also just any thoughts on the FHFA stopping the review of the scoring alternatives I guess?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Well, first, with respect to the mortgage pricing, we put in place some pricing changes some time ago. As you know, the way that market works, many of the contracts with the end users are over extended period of time. And so, not all the pricing has completely kicked in. But we haven't had any issues. Things seem to be going very smoothly there. With respect to the FHFA process, we're on board with it and remains to be seen where it goes.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And maybe just last question. Any thoughts on market trends and color, just the usual on mortgage or to cars (17:22), any changes there?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: We're continuing to see strength. I mean, everyone worries about the fall off in volumes, but we're not really seeing it.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question is from Brett Huff with Stephens. Please go ahead.
Blake Anderson - Stephens, Inc.: Hi. This is Blake on for Brett. Thanks for taking my questions. First one is the bookings, those were nice in the quarter. It seems that you're getting more larger deals, as you pointed out. With that in mind, I was wondering if we could get an update on the pace of cloud infrastructure investment and maybe the duration of that. Any update on how that is going, how long it should last? And specifically in the quarter, gross margin was a little bit lower than we had modeled at least. Was there any incremental infrastructure investment in the quarter maybe that was in that line item?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Yeah. So, we're seeing – well, we entered the year with an internal mantra of cloud first. And our sales organization, their compensation plans, even our internal non-sales comp plans are really focused on building out a world-class cloud business that we believe we're well underway to doing that. What we've seen so far through nine months is we've seen a tremendous amount of growth on the bookings side, well over 130% year-to-date compared to the prior year. And along the way, as I think we've mentioned numerous times, we've increased our investment in our security, in our operations, in our infrastructure. And frankly, most of the new employees that are finding their way into FICO are tied to those kinds of activities. Many of them are in our lower cost areas, including in Bangalore. But the point is a lot of the investments that we're making this year are to basically build out the infrastructure to keep up with all the demand and the actual growth in that business. So I would say the increase in costs that you've seen over the past few quarters has primarily been tied to that and it's starting to level off, but it's at this new run rate. The only other item that is maybe of interest on the expense run rate at least this quarter is, it was a bit inflated in quarter three because we had our annual FICO World Customer User Conference in April, and that's $3 million to $4 million of one-time marketing dollars get spent for that event. But beyond that, we're just kind of continuing to put money against the growth and the opportunity in the cloud.
Blake Anderson - Stephens, Inc.: Great. And then, with regards to the price increase in mortgage, can you talk about the potential for maybe other price increases you maybe see in the future in the B2B segment? Are there any specific verticals or use cases you think most likely? And then any timing you'd give on that as well?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: There's no specific verticals and no specific timing. We regularly and continuously review our pricing. We have the flexibility to change our pricing once a year. And so there is kind of an annual cycle for that. I think that you can be assured that our Scores people are trying to strike the right balance between not shocking the market with price increases, but at the same time making sure that we are adequately compensated for the value that we're providing. And so there's a continual assessment of that. We interview customers and our distribution channels to understand what's appropriate. And we recognize we're in a special position and are careful about that.
Blake Anderson - Stephens, Inc.: All right. And then last one for me was, you mentioned the refi. That other expense was a little bit higher than we expected. Did that higher interest expense kick-in in the third quarter at all? And then maybe any comments on the impact there on the interest expense line?
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: Yeah. The debt was refinanced in first week of May. And so I guess it was a partial quarter where we had reduced the revolver, which is just around 3% debt, around that area, and we replaced it with about 5% debt on the new offering. But what you ought to see over the course of the next few quarters going forward is some nominal increase in interest expense, but not all that significant, because our weighted debt is just nominally higher than what it was pre-refinancing.
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: And the revolver is tied to LIBOR and that's been taken out. So that's some of it too.
Blake Anderson - Stephens, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: We have a question from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good afternoon, everyone.
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: Hi, Bill.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So, first of all, congratulations on the really strong bookings. That's impressive.
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thanks.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: The first question for you is that I wanted to ask about the cyber security product. It looked like you had started on a new strategy, a freemium/premium model. So I was going to ask about what the plan is with that and then how also you think about the overall opportunity in terms of what it could be for you.
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Oh, thanks for asking that question. We're very excited about our prospects there. So, as you know, we call it the Enterprise Security Score. It comes in two forms, one is an outside-in look at a company. So you can look at all your vendors. You can look at all kinds of people from the outside-in without their permission just based on what's publicly visible. And then there's an inside-out look, which goes much deeper and is the kind of thing that companies would do for themselves and insurance underwriters might insist on for underwriting cyber insurance for an insured. And so those are the two broad flavors. What you're referring to the freemium model is, it turns out that it's not that hard for us to produce this score. And there is some cost associated with it, but not huge cost. And therefore we thought that in the interest of adoption, we should make it free and let people get their own FICO Enterprise Security Score by going to the website and signing up. And they'll get their score and they get the feedback. And then they also have an opportunity, I should point out, to improve their score, if they think that any of the data on which the score is based is erroneous. They have an opportunity to submit that and potentially improve their scores, if they feel like there's any error there. And then, from there, obviously you move to paid product and you'll be paying for assessing all of your vendors and so on.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: And then the revenue trends look very strong. The bookings trends look very strong. I wanted to ask about how we should start to think about the timing of when we should see some of that strong incremental profitability actually flow through and drive some margin expansion?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: That's another great question, Bill, and we wrestle with that one. We wrestle with that one internally all the time because, as you know, we have a lot of control over our expenses...
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Right.
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: ...and we can improve the software margins at any time at will. I mean, we really can. And so, for us, the debate is always is this the year to do it, should we be dialing back our investment and stretch out the roadmap, the timeline for producing all this innovation that we're producing. In the interest of showing our investor base that we have this profit-making potential or, alternatively, should we continue to invest based on what we believe the market opportunity is to carve out kind of first-mover advantages, I mean I think we have the absolute world-leading analytics platform, there's no one that has anything quite like what we have. And so we're in a little bit of a race and we're really throwing a lot of energy and resource at it. But the balance is there and it's in our control. And so I think you'll just see us going year-by-year and making a determination about how much and at what pace do we want to make these investments. I think it would be fair to assume that over the coming five years, the margin is just going to continually trickle upward. It's going to tick upward. But in terms of a commitment to improving the margin right now, I think that really depends on this balance between market opportunity.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: And then you talked about a number of different applications. You didn't mentioned CCS and I just wanted to check in on that one. That's one that I know you had been getting a lot of traction with in the past. Just wanted to get a sense for about approximately what it was in terms of dollar size. What kind of growth rate you're seeing on it and where are you getting the best adoption?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Okay. So Mike will give you the growth rate in a second, but I would just say that CCS continues to be a very strong business for us. We have the world's leading product there. Obviously, the components of messaging to a consumer, many of those are commoditized and are available at kind of commodity price levels. But CCS has a tremendous amount of value-add and case management associated with it, and we obviously have all the analytics horsepower that we bring to it. And so, in a world where our customers are increasingly focused on customer journey and understanding the consumer through the entire life cycle, having the ability to interact with the consumer and optimize every one of those interactions is increasingly important. And so we're just seeing a lot of appetite and uptake for it. It's very strong in Asia right now. We finally have enough capacity between owned data centers and AWS extension. We have the capacity now to support customers in a way that we never had before. And so we're seeing geographic expansion. And, of course, our core customers in the UK and in the U.S. are very happy in renewing our product.
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: In terms of the numbers, Bill, the CCS business is growing year-to-date about 14% and the run rate is just around $25 million per quarter of all recurring cloud revenue. Third quarter, we were slightly below that, in fact half that, mainly because of some volume declines that happened at a couple of large customers as they were re-outlining some of their strategies. But we see those as kind of short-term items. Long-term, the pipeline is very fat and healthy in this area and the product is world-class.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yeah. And I just wanted to ask for a little clarification on – within Applications, of course everybody always thinks of you guys in terms of Falcon and TRIAD, but it seems like if you group together a couple of your other products like CCS and, I don't know which ones exactly in terms of the size, whether you would throw in Originations Manager in there or Strategy Director, but it seems like they're almost getting to the size of Falcon and TRIAD on a combined basis. I mean, maybe you can help us understand the dynamic within the portfolio of Applications?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Yeah. So you're absolutely right, there is growth. We're seeing good growth in Originations and in Strategy Director, and frankly, in collections and recovery also I mean. So, if you think about our big franchises, obviously, Scores is big and strong and in good shape; Falcon, same thing. And then you get into – the CCS is in good shape. We just talked about that. And then if you go down to our fourth and fifth and sixth businesses, they're all very healthy and doing really well and kind of taking share in the market, and that would be Originations, Strategy Director. I'd say those are the big ones. So Strategy Director, one way to think about that is it's the next generation of TRIAD. So it's not really a distinct thing. And yet very often it's sold together with Originations. And so it's both kind of a successor product to TRIAD as well as a sister product to Originations.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it.
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: One last thing I'd add to that, Bill, that probably wasn't evident in the pre-comments, but the collections and recovery product of ours, which we've had for now a little while, we've added a lot of features, capabilities, took it to the cloud. On a year-to-date basis, that part of our business has the largest bookings of the entire software suite is in collections and recovery and most of that sitting in backlog, which is pretty remarkable, because just two-and-a-half, three years ago that product was much smaller and when we sold it, it was all upfront license revenue. And that's just not the model with that anymore. So, that will become more prominent along with CCS and Originations I think over the next 12 to 18 months.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yeah. One housekeeping item, number of shares that you actually bought in July?
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: We spent $55 million and it was, let me give you a number, 300-some-thousand shares.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay.
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: Give me a good quick second and I'll put my finger on that for you.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. While you're doing that, I'll slip in another one. I just wanted to check in on FICO XD, just to see where that was in the adoption. I know that we've gone through beta testing with a number of banks. I think there were a couple of banks who were trying it out. Just trying to get a sense for how that's doing.
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: So far so good. I mean, everything is right on track with XD. You know that adoption is slow, but there's a lot of appetite for it and it continues to proceed apace. We announce adoption as we can once our customers are comfortable that they're going to adopt and it's gotten through the testing and so on.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay.
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: Yeah. We took in about 240,000 shares in the month of July.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: 240,000 shares.
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: Our share count is just over 29.2 million, 29.1 million, right in that range right now, after the plan.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. That's what I was trying to get at, so. All right. Well, I've got to go because I've got to get home and work on my tasks that are being assigned to me by the Score Planner, so I can improve my FICO Score.
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thanks a lot. You'll get up there yet, we'll get you a mortgage someday.
Operator: And we have a question from the line of Adam Klauber with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good afternoon. Just a couple of follow-ups. So, on the Applications bookings, just a ballpark, how much actually is coming from the Origination and collections? Is that the majority of it now?
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: Adam, give me a second, I'll take a peek. We had a pretty good quarter in both Originations, collections and recovery, and fraud banking. So, between the three of them, that was about $50 million of the $80 million, those three product lines.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Okay. And I think you said the pipeline even for more new business is still pretty good in both those products?
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: Yeah. Collections and recovery in particular, we have a very large cloud pipeline. We're starting to see it level off a little bit in Originations. We've been on fire the last two years and that's levelling off some and it's being replaced frankly with collections and recovery and our Strategy Director products.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: And with the collections and recovery, is that more replacing competitor products or is that more sort of a new tool for banks that they just haven't had before?
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: No, it's replacing usually an existing vendor or an internally billed product. Most of these are third-party vendors. So it's a complicated piece of software. It's 5 million lines of code, our collections and recovery business. So those if you're big and complicated, you don't build them yourself, you go look for a vendor and we're more often than not now on that short list.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And what's the average term of the contracts both on the Origination and collections? Do they tend to be longer on average?
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: No, our average term blended all-in was 28 months. These tend to around three years.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Okay. And then DMS, I think you've talked about transition a fair amount, but for next year do you think overall revenue will be flat or up based on that transition?
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: We'll let you know here in three months. To be quite honest, we're – and the reason I say that is a big contributor to our growth rates on a go-forward basis is the amount of deals we book and how they what we call waterfall or how they roll out and get recognized in the future.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Sure.
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: And because we have such a heavy weighting of our bookings in the fourth quarter, it's often hard to do an estimate of how much revenue we'll have in the bank and rolling forward into next year until we get closer to the end of the quarter. So, that's why we really haven't given a whole lot of directional guidance at this point yet.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yes. That makes sense. And then, on the FICO Score Planner, how is that business being monetized?
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: It becomes part of the bundled package that we sell on myFICO or that our vendors and resellers are selling into their package. So it really helps support the existing consumer pricing and in maybe some cases it creates a little premium. But, right now, it just becomes part of a richer bundle of packages and gives consumers more reason to go in and sign up and stay longer.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. And is that having that – not maybe ask for a number, but is that having a material effect on the growth in B2C right now?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Not yet.
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: No, not yet. We just announced it here a month ago. It's a pretty neat innovation, but it just literally got announced within the last 30 days.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time.
Steven P. Weber - Fair Isaac Corp.: Okay. This concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the call. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Fair Isaac Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Thursday, April 26, 2018. I will now turn the conference over to Steve Weber. Please go ahead.
Steven P. Weber - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining FICO's second quarter earnings call. I'm Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike Pung. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared with the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate an understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular in the Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through April 26, 2018. Now I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thanks, Steve. I'm happy to say we delivered our highest revenue quarter ever, and our team is executing at a high level. We remain very bullish on our business and because of the increased visibility into our growth, we are today raising our full year guidance which Mike will explain shortly. In our second quarter, we reported revenues of $258 million an increase of 13% over the same period last year. We delivered $32 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $1.03 per share. We delivered $48 million of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS of $1.54. Most importantly, we're delivering revenue growth while we're successfully transitioning our business model from upfront license revenue to a recurring revenue base. This quarter year-over-year revenue grew at 13% even while license revenue declined by 36%. We were able to drive growth through increasing our recurring revenue which is up 21% over the last year. In fact, recurring revenues accounted for 76% of our total revenues this quarter compared with 71% last year. In Applications, revenues were up 9% over the prior year. Our Originations Solutions and Customer Communication Services were particularly impressive, up 50% and 17% respectively from last year. We were able to grow total recurring revenue in Applications by 14% giving us more visibility to predictable future revenues. In our Decision Management Software, we continued to make progress even as this segment sees the most impact of the revenue model transition. This quarter for instance, upfront licenses were down 52% from last year, which caused total revenues to be down about 19%. Historically, Blaze Advisor and Xpress Optimization were sold as perpetual or term licenses. More and more we're selling these in the cloud either our own FICO Analytic Cloud or on AWS. And as a result the revenue is reported as SaaS recurring revenue. We continue to have a healthy pipeline of opportunities as our technology drives sales in both our DMS and Applications segments. In the Scores business we had a great quarter as we continue to look for new revenue opportunities. Total revenues were up 34% versus the prior year and are up 26% year-to-date. On the B2B side, revenues were up 47% over the same period as last year. This was driven partly by increased volumes but much of it was due to targeted price increases. As we've been saying for the last several quarters, we are continually reviewing our pricing practices and have identified instances where the pricing was not commensurate with the value delivered. We implemented some adjustments in January with pricing increases, in this case primarily, in mortgage originations. B2C revenues were up 13% this quarter and 19% year-to-date. We continue to roll out new programs with existing partners and are beginning to see revenues from recently implemented deals. We still have a large pipeline of potential deals and see many opportunities to serve this constantly evolving space. As always, we remain focused on driving shareholder value. We've repurchased nearly $125 million in shares halfway through our fiscal year. At the same time we're actively investing in exploiting the many opportunities that we're pursuing. I'll share some summary thoughts later, but now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike for further financial details.
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. Today I'll emphasize three points in my comments. First, we delivered $258 million of revenue, an increase of $29 million or 13% year-over-year. Recurring revenue was $195 million, up 21% from last year and bookings were $102 million, up 12% from last year. Second, we delivered $32 million of GAAP net income which is up 29% year-over-year. And finally, we had $42 million of free cash flow this quarter and we spent $75 million on repurchasing shares. I'll begin by breaking the revenue down into our three reported segments. Start with Applications where revenues were $147 million, up 9% versus the same period last year. We had a particularly strong quarter in Originations and our Customer Communications Services product lines, which both had strong increases in transactional volumes. Our Applications bookings of $69 million is up 42% from last year. In the Decision Management Software segment revenues were $23 million, down 19% versus the prior year due to the decreased license sales. Recurring revenue in DMS were up 3% from the previous year and bookings were $20 million, while down 15% from last year it was up 68% over last quarter. Finally, in our Scores segment, revenues were $88 million up 34% from the same period last year. On the B2B side, we're up 47% versus the same period a year ago due primarily to some targeted price increases in mortgage as well as overall volume increases. The B2C revenues were up 13% from the same quarter last year. We continue to expect to see continued growth from both B2B and B2C in the back half of our year. Looking at revenues by region, this quarter 75% of total revenues were derived in the Americas, our EMEA region generated 17% and the remaining 8% was from Asia Pacific. Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter represented 76% of total revenue, consulting and implementation revenues were 18% of total and license revenues were just 6% of total revenue. Cloud revenue was $63 million this quarter, up 26% from last year. In fact year-to-date cloud revenues are $120 million, up 20% from the same period last year. Bookings this quarter were $102 million, up 12% from the prior year, we generated $13 million of current period revenue on those bookings for a yield of only 13%. The weighted average term for our bookings was 30 months this quarter, and this quarter we had 13 deals over $1 million, and we booked six deals in excess of $3 million. In addition, our cloud bookings were $32 million this quarter and are $51 million year-to-date, which is almost double from the same period last year. Operating expenses totaled $210 million this quarter, compared to $195 million in the first quarter. This increase primarily relates to variable expenses associated with our increased revenue and employee incentive costs including the special all employee restricted stock grant we announced last quarter. We expect to maintain our current cost run rate over the back half of the year while we actively invest our resources in our highest strategic priorities. As you can see in our Reg G schedule, our non-GAAP operating margin was 27% in the second quarter. We expect some margin expansion in the back half of the year and that the full year operating margin will be between 26.5% to 28.5%. GAAP net income this quarter was $32 million and non-GAAP net income was $48 million or $1.54 per share. The effective tax rate was about 21% this quarter and we expect our tax rate to be in the low to mid 20s over the remainder of 2018. Free cash flow for the quarter was $42 million versus $61 million in the prior year. And for the trailing 12 months our free cash flow was $183 million. Now, turning to the balance sheet, we had a $108 million of cash on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. Our total debt is $704 million with a weighted average interest rate of 4.2% and the ratio of our total net debt to adjusted EBITDA this quarter is 2.24 times, well below our covenant level of three times. Depending upon market conditions we may be refinancing some of our debt over the next two quarters. During the quarter we returned $75 million in excess cash to our investors, repurchasing 461,000 shares at an average price of $162.71. And through the first two quarters of our fiscal year we repurchased almost 800,000 shares at an average price of just over $156. We have about $162 million remaining on our latest board authorization and continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. We also continue to actively evaluate opportunities to acquire relevant technologies and products that advance our strategy or strengthen our portfolio and competitive position. Finally, as Will mentioned, we're raising our previously provided guidance. We're now guiding the full fiscal year as follows. We expect revenues to be about $1.02 billion, up from the previously guided $990 million. GAAP net income which we previously guided at $136 million is now expected to be approximately $140 million. GAAP earnings per share, previously guided at $4.34, is now approximately $4.47 and non-GAAP net income previously $191 million is now expected to be $200 million, which equates to $6.38 per share on a non-GAAP basis. With that, I'll turn it over to Will for his final comments.
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thanks, Mike. We are halfway through our fiscal year and I'm very happy with where we stand. Last week we hosted our FICO World Conference where we brought together more than 1,000 of our customers to showcase the latest in our decisioning solutions. I had the opportunity to sit with many customers and those discussions confirmed for me that we are uniquely positioned to help a wide range of companies solve their most difficult decisioning problems. Our development teams have done a magnificent job of cloud enabling our IP and tailoring it to be delivered in an efficient cost effective manner. And our sales team is successfully signing deals to build the backlog of recurring transactional revenue. At the same time our FICO Scores continues to prove the value they bring to the entire financial ecosystem. We believe we're poised to do great things in the remainder of fiscal 2018 and beyond. I'll now turn the call back to Steve for Q&A.
Steven P. Weber - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thanks Will. This concludes our prepared remarks and we're ready now to take your questions. Operator, please open the lines.
Operator: Certainly. Our first question is from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. How are you guys doing? Good evening.
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Good.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: My first question is just is the guidance raised entirely due to the B2B scores performance?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: It's pretty much all around our Scores business, yeah, both B2B and B2C.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So, I mean those price increases that you implemented, my guess is you, I guess, sort of knew that was happening. So was there a hesitation that it wasn't going to take hold that you didn't include it in guidance in the beginning or maybe just some more color there?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: No, I think that it's a matter of certainty versus uncertainty. So we had our views about the way things would likely evolve. But until it's done, it's not done. And so as you know, we tend to be conservative on guidance.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. And then maybe just on that specifically. Obviously, in the context of the news around what TAM (14:29) you want to do and so forth in the mortgage market and the debate around the scores, I guess just some thoughts on your timing to put that price increase with that debate going on?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Yeah. I think that's a fair question, we did talk about it. And I think our view is that who knows how this is going to shake up from a regulatory standpoint – from a statutory standpoint. But in the event that we wind up being a sole source score provider, we didn't want it said that we were leveraging that position to push through price increases. I mean, I think that we're really trying to just have the pricing reflect the value being provided to the end user.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then last one just on this, I guess what I'm trying to understand is on the B2B score side like what was just the market driven growth, so ex your price increases. And I guess, just trying to make sure we don't – you don't take this 47% and add that to your numbers for the rest of the year basically?
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: Yeah. Two points to that, Manav. So we're not going to get real granular in terms of how much of this came from price versus how much came from volume. But I can tell you that we saw volume increases across the board, across all the lifecycles that we talk about, B2B. And in certain cases some of the lifecycles were in the high-single digits. But that being said, obviously a significant amount did come from some of the very targeted pricing that we did do. As it relates to what we see in this guidance that we just provided, we see a run rate in scores similar to what we delivered in the second quarter and certainly the rest of the year will be dependent upon increases or decreases in volume and any other pricing schedules that begin to become applicable. Again, the bureaus roll these out to their end customers over a period of time and so the uncertainty Will was referring to is because we're not party to those agreements, it's uncertain when exactly the bureaus pass on some of these increases. So that's one of the reasons why this wasn't included back in November when we gave our guidance.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Got it. Thanks guys. I'll turn it over.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens. Please go ahead.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions.
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Sure, Brett.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Can we – thanks for the detail on the B2B scores that (00:17:44) things like that given that you guys use channels to distribute those, I wanted to follow up on any new developments in the B2C relationships that you have, the channel solutions that you're working with Experian and then maybe some of the other credit card providers, it's one of the things that at least to us seems like a really big opportunity and it seems like those lead generation efforts on the part of more customized issuers seem to be doing well. Any new developments there?
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: Nothing new in terms of new clients that we're announcing today. I would say though that we've signed a number of deals in the past quarters. They're starting to ramp. Not all of them are fully ramped yet. In this quarter, our consumer revenue coming through those channels are almost as large each quarter as are myFICO business. So both are growing at a very nice rate, I'd like to call out our myFICO business is growing better than 5%, 6%, 7%, so what you're seeing in our numbers on the B2C side is just continue to roll out of what we have and we're continuing to work deals as they arise, but nothing new to announce this quarter.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: And then just to dig in a little bit on Scores. Any commentary, I think, you mentioned different lifecycles of the Scores, some were high single-digits, some were lower. Where did pre-screen fall into that? I don't know if you want to get that granular, but sometimes you'll give us the data on pre-screen?
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: Yeah. Our pre-screen, our acquisitions scores actually was the highest. It was very high-single digit this quarter. There were some very strong marketing from what we saw this quarter in the numbers we're reporting.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: And then last question for me just a general kind of loan origination environment, anything you guys are seeing change either accelerate or decelerate, particular verticals that have changed since the last time we all talked?
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: No, not really. Things are pretty solid in the same areas that it has been. We're not seeing any significant shift from certainly last quarter or even the last couple.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. That's what I needed. Thanks for your time, guys.
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Sure.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Adam Klauber with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks. Couple on Applications, clearly it's some good volumes, but how much of the growth, for just general sense, came from more products from existing clients or how much came from new clients. In other words, what was not volume related?
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: Yeah. So a lot of it came, a lot of the growth on the recurring line in particular came from deals that we signed or booked in our fourth quarter, third quarter last year. And they're starting to come online. So we had a lot of growth that came from deals at that point in time. I would say the mix of new client logos versus existing client logos still is primarily existing client logos. It's more – more than half easily or coming from existing customers who are adopting some of the new products. Though we do have a couple of new marquee customers and new logos that we signed to the latter part of last year where you're starting to see the recurring revenue. So it's a nice blend but mainly coming from our existing customer base.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Okay. And then I know sometimes on renewals they can be lumpy as we think about the next quarter or two, have there been any renewals that have been moved up or down that we should think about that could cause some lumpiness?
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: No, we have some scheduled renewals coming in quarter three and in quarter four, we've kind of baked in the effect of that into our new guidance but nothing sizable I would say.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Okay. And then in DMS, clearly you have the shift going on towards cloud and away from license. Could you have just some sense when you think revenue will stabilize?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Yeah, I think that's happening right now as we speak. We're seeing the revenues starting to climb in spite of the transition.
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: Yeah. I think, Adam, I would say the one kind of disappointment we maybe have this quarter was the timing of some deals. Coming into the very end of the quarter we had, I don't know, roughly $10 million, maybe a little bit more, in deals that we expected to sign that would be book deals not upfront revenue, but book deals with recurring revenue and ended up either signing after the quarter or we're still closing them and pursuing them. So there is the lumpiness that will occur in this business, probably less in license revenue and more in bookings...
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Right.
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: As we go forward. But there is a lot of pipeline...
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay.
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: ...there in DMS and we're really happy with the market acceptance and demand around this product.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good afternoon, everyone.
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Hi. Bill.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So, I don't know, in some ways, I'm speechless. When was the last time you guys raised guidance within the year? I mean, are we talking like -?
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: I've been around 14 years, Bill. It's been a little while, but we've done it. We've done it.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: It was like 2013, I think, right.
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: You got a better calendar than I do on these things.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Anyway. So, I think that probably says something right there. As I look at the 47% growth in the B2B side, it's definitely above anything that I was modelling. So is the thought that we rolled that 47% growth in that piece of the business forward, assuming volumes remain the same as they have been remaining. Does the price increase continue to flow through for the rest of the year? I am assuming that's the way it is, I just want to make sure?
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: Yeah. I think the run rate that we delivered this quarter, the overall run rate $88 million which includes this piece of the B2B is a fairly good run rate to be using right now if all things remain the same on the quantity side. And again, as I mentioned, there is a little bit of uncertainty as to how the rate card gets applied through each of the three bureaus and so there could be a little bit of volatility along the way, but we're assuming in our numbers at least that the run rate is stable.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: How are things going on the lead gen side, you had signed up deals with or you've been working with Experian, with Discover, and it was a different revenue model, are you starting to see some meaningful volumes coming to those channels?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: I think the meaningful volumes are still in our future, but we don't really control it, it's more in the hands of our partners. And so when they ramp we will be in good shape, but they're not really, they're in the process of ramping now.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it.
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: Yeah. It wasn't a big needle mover this quarter, but it was definitely some incremental revenue from what we've seen in the past but it wasn't a needle mover.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And then maybe you can talk a little bit about what's driving the strength in Originations and also in the Customer Communication side. Those numbers seem pretty strong within applications?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Yeah. I would say that the answer is the same in both situations. We have the best product in the market. So our Originations product is just a – it's a really high feature, high function elegant code, kind of an offering. And so it's not surprising that the marketplace has really embraced it. And so we're very busy selling it. Customer Communication Services, same thing, I think that we're best in class and we continue to refine what we do and improve the analytics and the feedback so that they can – so that our customers can maximize the return as their – and optimize their interactions with their customers. So it's really having great product is what it is. I mean, it sounds kind of like a throwaway, but it's – I mean it's truly because we have great products.
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: You know, Bill, I'd add to that, over the last couple of years, maybe over the last six, seven quarters but roughly call it two years. We've taken what was an Originations product that was not growing much at all. In fact in some cases stepping backwards and over that two year, the last two year period, we signed 25 or more cloud customers, some pretty needy ones in the banking industry. And what you're starting to see in the revenue is you're starting to see the go lives and you're starting to see the recurring revenue coming on that. That's what accounts for the 50% growth in Originations. These have been deals that we've talked about being booked in the past that are now starting to go live and we've got a lot of people working on Originations business, because, as Will said, it's been winning a lot of deals in the market.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yeah. I remember last year the challenge had been that you have been booking a lot of business and the expense side, you had to invest in order to implement the business and also to build out the technology infrastructure to support the business. Now, are you getting to the point where the incremental investment in implementations and infrastructure is starting to slow?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: I wish I could say we're getting to that point, but we're not really slowing. The opportunity set is so strong that we're investing for the future and cloud, security, managed services, professional services to support all that. And we're making the investments that show up on the cost side so that the business can be as strong as we think it can be.
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: Yeah, I would add one more thing, Bill. Where last year we talked a lot about originations pipeline and deals that we were signing. We believe we're at the frontend of seeing a lot of that on the collections and recovery side. In fact this quarter our largest deal that we booked, which was just north of $10 million in the aggregate was a very solid collections and recovery in the cloud deal, probably one of the largest that'll to be implemented on the planet by us and so we're seeing a very good pipeline on that side as well and the hope of course is to see a repeat of what we've done on the Originations side with that product line.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Now it also sounded like you guys have been working on a combination fraud and compliance product, two areas that typically within banks have been handled very separately, but would seem like they would fit together closely, is that the case and where is that paid?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Bill, that is the case, we're very much focused on a broad fraud footprint and the way KYC and AML and fraud are all committing app frauds, they're all coming together and so we're looking at it more holistically and our customers are asking for it that way too.
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: Yeah, the product hasn't been released yet Bill, but what we're seeing in terms of deals that underpin some of these bookings is we're seeing a lot of Falcon/CCS deals happening together, those are already of course fairly well integrated. And while we're integrating the AML Solution that we bought from TONBELLER, we're actually seeing a ton of standalone AML deals, some quite large ones and we expect a few more before the end of the year. Falcon X as Stuart calls it will be hopefully available by the end of the calendar.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Excellent. All right. Well, thank you very much. Congratulations on a really strong quarter.
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thanks. Thanks, Bill.
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thanks, Bill.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time.
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thank you. That concludes today's call. We would like to thank you all for joining us. Have a good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

===== 2018 Q1  (2018-01-25 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Steve Weber - VP, IR Will Lansing - CEO Mike Pung - CFO
Analysts: Brett Huff - Stephens Incorporated Manav Patnaik - Barclays Katelyn Young - William Blair Bill Warmington - Wells Fargo
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Fair Isaac Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, January 25, 2018. And now, I’d like to turn the conference over to Steve Weber. Please go ahead.
Steve Weber: Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining FICO’s first quarter earnings call. I’m Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations and I’m joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike Pung. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the Company’s filings with the SEC, in particular in the Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website, or from our Investor Relations team. This call also includes statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the Company’s earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and the Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the Company’s website at fico.com or on the SEC’s website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through January 25, 2019. And now, I’ll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
Will Lansing: Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. I’m pleased with the results and I’m happy to see we have good momentum as we look at the year ahead. In our first quarter, we reported revenues of $235 million, an increase of 7% over the same period last year. We delivered $27 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $0.86 per share. Our GAAP earnings and EPS include the charge of $12 million or $0.37 per share associated with the recent enactment of tax reform. We delivered $41 million of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS of $1.30 per share, up 23% and 27%, respectively from the same period last year. Mike will talk more about the impacts of tax reform but it is certainly a net positive for us going forward. We believe the reduced ongoing tax rate will have a positive impact in fiscal 2018 of nearly $14 million and today are updating our guidance to reflect that. In light of tax reform, we also announced to our employees today that we’ll be issuing a special grant of 10 restricted stock units to every FICO employee, making each employee an owner to share in our long-term success. On the software side of our business, we continue to build through our recurring revenue base as we sell more cloud-based deals. Our applications segment was up 5% over last year and recurring revenue was up 10%. We had particularly good quarters with our compliance, Customer Communications Services, collections and recovery and originations solutions. These products are innovative, relatively new cloud-based products and they’re now getting to a size where their growth can move the needle for the Company. In our decision management software, revenues were down about $1.5 million or 6% due to less upfront license sales. Our emphasis is on cloud deals in DMS, meaning more recurring revenue. However, those revenues were up 13%. Overall, our cloud based revenues were up 13% and our cloud based bookings were up 34% over the same period last year. In the Scores business, we continue to drive significant growth. Revenues this quarter were $70 million, up 18% from the same period last year. On the B2C side, revenues were up 27% over the previous year as we had new partners and seek growth from our existing partners. Today’s consumers are more focused than ever on their personal financial information and their credit worthiness. We’ve been focused on educating consumers first to our Open Access program and then with partners to provide additional content around the Scores with information like simulators, score ingredients, summary reports and monitoring. We are constantly looking for ways to expand offerings to consumers and provide more value to our partners to work together to give consumers best possible view how lenders assess them. On the B2B side, revenues were up 13% over the previous year as we continue to see increases in both volume and price. The current credit climate remains very strong and we expect to drive growth on the B2B side throughout this fiscal year. I’d like to take a minute to update you on our Financial Inclusion Initiatives that we’ve been talking about over the last several quarters. As you know FICO is an independent data analytics company, not a credit bureau. FICO’s role in the lending system is to harness the credit bureau’s data to produce FICO Scores, which are predictive of consumers’ credit risk. In order to produce the credit score that is reliable and predictive, we rely on quality data standards that are refined over decades and we know what’s at stake. The consumer’s ability to get a car loan or mortgage hinges on the lender’s ability to accurately assess risk. Our data standards play an important role in ensuring the robustness and accuracy of our credit scoring system and by extension the stability and soundness of millions of lending decisions every day. We are responsibly using new and regulatory compliant alternative data sources that allow us to give reliable FICO Scores to people who cannot be scored using credit bureau data alone. Our approach ensures that the integrity of our scoring standards as well as the expansion of credit scoring to a broader, more inclusive and more diverse group than ever before. I’ll share some summary thoughts later but now I would like to turn the call over to Mike for further financial details.
Mike Pung: Thanks, Will Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I’ll emphasize three points in my prepared comments. First, we delivered $235 million of revenue, an increase of $16 million or 7% year-over-year. Recurring revenue grew 14% over last year, double-digit growth in all three segments and at a $175 million accounted for nearly 3/4 of the quarter’s revenue. Second, we delivered $27 million of GAAP net income, which included some charges associated with the tax reform act. Our ongoing recurring tax rate will decline over the remainder of the year, resulting in an estimated savings of $14 million or $0.44 per share. Finally, we generated $25 million of free cash flow this quarter and we used $50 million to repurchase shares in quarter one and an additional $50 million for repurchases in January. I’ll begin by breaking the revenue down into our three reported segments. Starting with the applications, revenues were a $141 million, up 5% versus the same period last year. Recurring revenue grew 10% over last year, partially offset by a decline in license revenue. We had a very strong quarter in our Customer Communications Services product where volumes pushed revenues up 18% from last year. We also had a strong quarter in collections and recovery, up 14% and in originations, up 13%. Our applications bookings of $62 million were flat with the prior year. In the Decision Management Software segment, revenues were $24 million, down 6% versus the last year due to fewer upfront license sales. That was partially offset by an increase of 13% in recurring revenue. Bookings of $12 million were also down, following last quarter’s record bookings. As we continue to transition to more SaaS based deals, we will likely see less upfront revenue but more recurring. And finally, in our Scores segment, revenues were $70 million, up 18% from last year. On the B2B side, we’re up 13% versus last year and are continuing to see positive trends. The B2C revenues were up 27% from the same quarter last year. As Will noted, we expect Scores growth to continue to accelerate throughout the year. Looking at revenues by region, this quarter’s 74% of total revenues were derived from the Americas; our EMEA region generated 18%; and the remaining 8% was from Asia Pacific. Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources continued to trend up, this quarter representing 74% of total revenue. Consulting and implementation revenue were 18% and license revenues were 8% of total. Bookings this quarter were $82 million, down 15% from the prior year quarter. Total bookings for the trailing four quarters is $450 million. We generated $15 million of current period revenues on those bookings for a yield of 19%. The weighted average term for our bookings was 27 months this quarter. And this quarter we had 9 deals over a $1 million including 4 deals over $3 million. Operating expenses totaled to $195 million this quarter compared to $192 million in the fourth quarter. The increase is primarily related to our annual salary increase. And as you can see in our Reg G schedule, our non-GAAP operating margin was 25% for the first quarter. We expect that operating margin to be between 26.5% and 28.5% for the full year. GAAP net income this quarter was $27 million and included a charge to income tax expense of $12 million or $0.37 per share associated with the Tax Cuts and Job Act. The charge encompasses several elements, including a tax on accumulated overseas earnings and profits, and the re-measurement of deferred income taxes. We also had a reduction to income tax expense of $11.5 million, or $0.36 per share associated with the excess tax benefits from shareholders. Including all these items, the effective tax rate was about 20% this quarter. We anticipate a reduction in our tax rate will result in a savings in our fiscal 2018 of about $14 million. We are still evaluating the long-term impact of the tax reform but expect our tax rate to be in the low to mid-20s over the remainder of 2018. Free cash flow for the quarter was $25 million versus $28 million in the prior year. Turning to the balance sheet, we had $94 million of cash on hand at the end of the quarter. Our total debt is $664 million with a weighted average interest rate of 4%. The ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA this quarter is 2.2 times, below the covenant level of three times. During the quarter, we returned $50 million in excess cash to our investors, repurchasing 335,000 shares at an average price of around $148. We repurchased another 313,000 shares in January at an average price of about $160. We have about $187 million remaining on the latest board authorization and continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. We also continue to actively evaluate opportunities to acquire technologies and products that advance our strategy or strengthen our portfolio and competitive position. And finally, we are updating our previously provided guidance to adjust for the impact of the tax reform legislation and the reduction in our share count. We are now guiding the full fiscal year as follows. Revenues remain unchanged at $990 million, GAAP net income previously guided at $139 million is now adjusted by the tax charges, and the ongoing rate benefit to $136 million, GAAP earnings-per-share is now approximately $4.34, non-GAAP net income previously guided at a $171 million is now revised to $191 million, making non-GAAP earnings per share an increase from $5.32 to $6.09 per share. With that I’ll turn it over to Will for some final comments.
Will Lansing: Thanks, Mike. As I said in my opening remarks, I believe we have remarkable momentum and are just beginning to reap the benefits of our strategic initiatives. Our Scores business continues to lead the way. It’s really a unique franchise business at the heart of the U.S. credit markets. And we continue to find new opportunities to make the most of that valuable IP. On the software side, the product innovation we have invested in over the last several years is opening new markets and allowing us to serve entirely new sets of customers. At the same time, we are making a gradual but steady transition to our recurring SaaS revenue model that will deliver predictable profitable revenue. It’s truly an exciting time to be at FICO. I’ll now turn over to Steve for Q&A.
Steve Weber: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks and we’re ready now to take any questions you may have. Operator, please open the line.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we have a question from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please proceed. Sorry Mr. Patnaik your line is open. We also have a question from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens Incorporated, please proceed.
Brett Huff: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Couple of quick questions. Definitely, I want to hear a little bit more about the B2C growth. I know that’s one of the big focuses that we hear from investors. It sounds like it was driven kind of across the board by your current partners continuing to kind of penetrate some of their programs and they’re pushing it, and then also some new partners. Are those new partners -- do they look like the old one, like with Experian or like maybe with Discover or are they new and different and any detail on that would be helpful?
Will Lansing: Yes, Brett. I mean, a great deal of it was driven from our expanded relationship with Experian which we announced last year in January along with the Discover deal. Recently, we booked some new transactions for an Affinity deal and several other educational programs, and those deals are starting to go live and we’re starting to see revenue flow from that. And I should also add that our myFICO business had a very nice quarter as well growing in the mid single digits. So, it’s a combination of a lot of small things beginning to add up.
Brett Huff: Can you talk a little bit about kind of the relative economics on any of those? I don’t know how much you guys have talked about how much more beneficial maybe selling for a consumer application, FICO Scores for consumer application versus a B2B. But have you maybe dimensionalized that for folks at all?
Will Lansing: No. I mean, we have I guess to some degree. We’ve talked certainly about the broader relationship with Experian and the way that the pricing dynamic works there, as they grow, we grow; and as they decline, we decline. So, we’re very much tied on a percent of success or failure. For each of the other deals, they’re very independently negotiated and they tend to be based upon the amount of technology or the amount of IP scoring technology they’re using in the systems that they’re implementing, and also based upon the size of the market they’re addressing. And so, we would literally have to go into each deal individually which of course we can’t do for confidentiality reasons.
Brett Huff: Okay. And then, one last question, on the 13% B2B growth that’s also really nice acceleration, I think you mentioned just kind of generally good place where we’re in the credit cycle and consumer and economic activity and things like that. Anything from a share shift point of view vis-à-vis the Equifax breach that you saw between potentially different distribution partners?
Will Lansing: No, but we don’t see any share shift, it’s just strength in the market and we don’t see any of that.
Brett Huff: One last one if I can. An update on which products we have SaaSified? I know that the communication, the origination manager, collections I think are all pure SaaS at this point. Where are we kind of innings wise on getting the Falcon and TRIAD products more that way? I believe last quarter you sold maybe what your first of one of those two in the SaaS version?
Will Lansing: Yes. Great question. It’s actually easier to ask the question which ones haven’t made the full transition yet. And you mentioned Falcon and TRIAD. What I would say is with respect to TRIAD, we actually have the TRIAD successor product called Strategy Director which is available in the cloud. And we also can offer Falcon in the in the cloud although it doesn’t -- it’s not as fully featured as we intend for it to be in the long run. So, there is more work to be done on falcon. But virtually, all of our major franchise offerings are available on the cloud now?
Operator: We have a question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please proceed.
Manav Patnaik: So, the first question was just obviously with the nice tax benefit, it looks you are giving employees those RSUs. But broadly, should we expect any change to capital allocation here, pick-up buybacks or maybe just do more M&A, just some thoughts there?
Will Lansing: No. I think the answer to that is no. I think our business continues to go along the direction it’s been on. The level of buyback is a function of our free cash flow and also kind of what we consider to be optimal leverage. And so, you’ll see our buybacks drift upward and downward to maintain the level of leverage that we think is efficient for our balance sheet. So, we’re -- as we mentioned, we are at 2.2 times, which is a little bit low for us. And so there is room for us to potentially increase the buyback a little bit, but I think the way to think about it as business as usual.
Manav Patnaik: Okay. And then, I was just wondering on the mortgage market side of things, the two-part question. One, what are the trends you are seeing there, within that 13% B2B, like is that all mainly credit card? And then, I guess, obviously, there is a the whole debate on the FICO Score within the mortgage market, if you have any thoughts there?
Mike Pung: I can take the trends part. This is Mike. The quantities of B2B FICO Scores pull this quarter were up across the board, across all of the lifecycles that we service, marketing, originations and account management. As it relates to specific areas, we saw tremendous amount of strength in credit cards and have for the last number of quarters. But credit cards was a very big driver this quarter. We also saw a lot of strength in our marketing of auto loans and origination of auto loans and mortgage was little bit up from last year, flat to up slightly.
Manav Patnaik: And just I guess thoughts just on the scoring debate out there in the market?
Will Lansing: Well, yes. As you know, there is some pressure on the GSEs to reconsider the scores that they use to put on the paper. And today, FICO was very much the standard there. And we continue to believe that makes sense for FICO to remain the standard there. There is an RFI out and we are responding to that with our [indiscernible] and up to date offerings. And we think that system that we have today works well and there is -- from a policy standpoint it is really wrapped around safety and soundness. So, we would anticipate -- we hope that that system won’t change.
Manav Patnaik: And then just last one for me on the DMS side of things, good to obviously see the recurring piece be up, but the license down. I mean, is that a trend we should continue to see? I was just hoping you could give us some more color there, maybe where we are in that transition, like what the mix looks like?
Will Lansing: Well, I think what we saw this quarter is a continuation of what we have seen in the last couple of quarters. And that is upfront license revenue was starting to trend downwards on DMS as we are growing our recurring revenue business. It will continue to be lumpy depending upon the timing of when a deal is booked and revenue was claimed. Obviously, this quarter, we had very light bookings, not only in DMS but frankly across the whole Company, which isn’t too surprising to us coming off of the record we had in the fourth quarter. The decline in the license revenue is more than offset in general in the business by the recurring revenue. So, it’s just the continued advancement of the business model to more recurring revenue coming from the cloud products.
Operator: We have a question from Katelyn Young with William Blair. please proceed.
Katelyn Young: I was wondering if you could spend some time talking about the bookings in the quarter. Obviously, I understand you are coming off some really strong quarters over the last year. So, I was wondering if you could please just compare and contrast the bookings this quarter with perhaps a year ago in terms of product mix or client mix and if it is anything that was noticeably weaker in the quarter, any trends you are seeing there?
Will Lansing: Yes. I wouldn’t call it a trend. I can explain a little bit about this quarter versus maybe prior quarters. Last years in total, we reported over $90 million each quarter bookings, with the last quarter of the year being been a very large record high. And we fell below that 90 million this quarter which internally was a disappointment to us. Fortunately, it was just due to some timing of some deals that we have in the pipeline and being we are in the first quarter, we are not too concerned that there’s any underlying trend there. It’s just simply the timing of when deals get signed and done. I would say that in the mix of the deals we have this quarter, many of them relate to our new cloud business including from a previous question we had another TRIAD cloud deal that we sign that was in one of our top 10 deals this quarter. So, there’s some very strong business that’s out there, unfortunately we didn’t get it all done by the end of December. But, we anticipate that we will catch itself up before the end of the fiscal year. So, beyond that, I wouldn’t say there is any other important trends to think of.
Katelyn Young: And then on the B2B growth side, are the XD relationships -- from the international work you guys are doing, is that a material contributor to revenue growth year-over-year yet or is that still kind of building out?
Will Lansing: Not yet, it is pretty much in build mode.
Operator: And we also have a question from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
Bill Warmington: So, first question for you on the pipeline in the B2C Scores business. So, it sounds like you’ve got the two education clients are ramping. The Affinity client, it looked like American Express under Experian went live in early January. So, congratulations on that. And then, on the lead gen side, you mentioned Experian and their group of banks and as well as Discover. I wanted to ask if there have been any new players added to those three buckets, and then, also, if there was a pipeline of potential new deals in each of those three buckets.
Will Lansing: Bill, there is a pipeline of potential opportunities in those buckets, and we added no new players in terms of new deals of any size that I can think of in quarter one. So, hopefully, we’ll have more to speak about in the next quarter or two on that.
Bill Warmington: Okay. And then, very strong performance on the B2B side. The question I had there is, is your guidance still assuming zero percent growth for that for the year?
Will Lansing: Well, inherently, it’s the same as what we guided at the end of last year, because we have not updated our revenue guidance. So, from that regard, yes, that is true. We obviously had a stronger first quarter than we anticipated. We have a lot of license revenue to sign to hit the 990. And based upon a lighter first quarter in that it made sense to just let the guidance ride as is. But, I would say it’s safe to say, we feel better and better as we continue to see strength in all aspects of our Scores business.
Bill Warmington: Okay. And then, on the DMS side, I just wanted to ask, you had mentioned that -- it sounded like there were some deals that were close to closing that may have closed after the end of December. How are bookings trending so far in the March quarter?
Will Lansing: Well, we’re not into March yet, Bill. Remember, we’re in January. I know out in Boston, you kind of wish it was the March timeframe. I’ll let you know. So, I would say, most of our deals frankly are loaded to the backend of any given quarter, usually comes in the third month of the quarter. And so, giving you much more guidance on January really probably won’t do a whole lot.
Bill Warmington: Okay. And then, another question on the tax reform. You’ve given us some guidance in terms of the actual rate impact and EPS impact. What’s the cash flow benefit do you expect on an annualized basis?
Will Lansing : Well, if our cash expense is going down $14 million, which is what we stated, that’s dollar for dollar cash. So, we should see that -- this claim for the timing of when the cash payments go out or estimated cash payments go out. But, over the course of time we should see at least $14 million starting to come back through our cash flow statement, at least based on the way we see it today.
Bill Warmington: Got it. And then, the only other question I had for you was on the -- housekeeping question, the impact of the grants that you are giving out on the share count going forward, how do you think about that?
Will Lansing: Yes. That’ll just be several million dollars this year, for the remainder of this fiscal year and they’ll might be a couple of million that’ll spill into next year but it’s a pretty inconsequential amount compared to our overall numbers.
Bill Warmington: Got it. One final one. You had mentioned the strength in the B2B volumes, which again, given the consumer credit tailwinds is not a surprise but you also mentioned better price there. Maybe you can talk a little bit about what’s going on there to drive better pricing?
Will Lansing: We adjust our prices for our score, all of our scores typically annually. And so, every year we evaluate kind of where we are and we make modest adjustments and this year is no different. And so, yes, there is a little bit of pricing impact, but every year, we have little bit pricing impact.
Mike Pung: Yes. What you are seeing in this quarter is the pricing impact that took effect basically January 1 of last year, just as an FYI.
Operator: And there are no further questions registered at this time.
Steve Weber: All right, thank you. Thank you all for joining today’s call. This concludes our call and we will be back to update you next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask you that you please disconnect your line.

===== 2017 Q4  (2017-11-01 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Steven P. Weber - Fair Isaac Corp. William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp. Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.
Analysts: Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc. Matthew E. Galinko - Sidoti & Co. LLC Blake Anderson - Stephens, Inc. William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Fair Isaac Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Wednesday, November 1, 2017. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Steve Weber, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead.
Steven P. Weber - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thank you, Colin. Good afternoon and thank you for joining FICO's fourth quarter earnings call. I'm Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike Pung. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular in the Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website, or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also feature statements including certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and the Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through November 1, 2018. And now, I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. I'll summarize our financial results for the quarter and full fiscal year and talk about the progress we've made this year on several fronts. Finally, I'll discuss the momentum we have going into 2018 and beyond. In our fourth quarter, we reported revenues of $253 million, a record quarter for us, and an increase of 7% over the same period last year. We delivered $40 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $1.25 per share, both up 25% from last year. And we delivered $53 million of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS of $1.65 per share, up 27% and 29%, respectively. The revenue and earnings growth is particularly impressive given our transition to cloud-based revenues. The 6% full year revenue growth comes in spite of our cloud transition. We have moved to a cloud-first strategy in development, sales and delivery. More and more, our customers are thinking cloud-first when they look to us for help to analyze and automate their decisioning processes. We began to see this demand nearly two years ago in originations where the dominant ask was for an originations platform in the cloud. In the last fiscal year, that cloud preference has moved to collections and recovery, account management, and fraud products as well. We made the important strategic decision several years ago to cloud-enable all of our technology, invest in our FICO Analytic Cloud, and make our products available through public clouds like AWS. Because of this, we now have well over $100 million of pipeline for our cloud products. This is enabling us to significantly build our recurring revenue base, which will mean predictable, profitable growth going forward. For other software companies, this sometimes means a disruption of revenue and earnings models. Many software companies have seen this as they've shifted from on-premise to cloud solutions. For FICO, this shift has had some impact on our revenue and margin growth, but it's been less dramatic for two reasons. First, our legacy revenue model incorporates a lot of recurring revenue. And second, our transition from license to cloud has been deliberately gradual. In 2017, we still had $100 million of upfront license sales, but that number was actually lower than 2016, as we sold more deals on our recurring revenue model. The lower license sales were more than offset by an 8% increase in our transactional revenues. This is especially encouraging, as most of our cloud bookings are recognized over several years, meaning we have more revenue to be recognized in future periods. Of course, to effectively build long-term repeatable cloud revenue, we need to book new deals. We've been able to accelerate our bookings over the last year, culminating this year in $146 million of new bookings, our largest quarter ever. In fact, this quarter, bookings were up 82% over the same period last year, and our full year bookings were up 13% over fiscal year 2016. These numbers not only validate our product strategy, but they also give us better visibility into future revenue flows and give us the building blocks for steady sustainable growth. And perhaps, most impressive about this quarter's bookings is the breadth of sales. We had 13 deals in the fourth quarter of $3 million or more and 29 for the fiscal year. That compares to the 10 we booked in all of 2016. And we're selling big deals in a variety of our product solutions. We had 10 different product lines in 2017 with deals larger than $3 million. The fact that we're booking more deals in more industry verticals with a variety of our products bodes well for us as we enter the new year. As we pursue our cloud-first strategy, we continue to add more advanced analytics throughout our product offerings. We have deep expertise with analytics and machine learning and have had success with many of our established products. We now have opportunities to take our expertise into new areas of demand. For instance, in anti-money laundering, the next level of innovation is in analytics. Most of the solutions available today are rules-based, but because of the sophisticated money laundering schemes, there's a necessity to attack the problem with much more sophisticated analytics. In this space, as well as others, we have a competitive advantage because there's demand for the very analytics in which we've invested for decades. This is at the very core of our Decision Management vision. Last year, I discussed our innovation and cloud strategy and that we were seeing signs of acceptance in discussions with customers and prospective customers. A year later, we have solid evidence with newly signed deals. We're still in the early stages of a new era for FICO and we're excited to continue to execute on the vision. In our Scores business, we had another very successful year. Scores were up 15% in the fourth quarter versus the prior year and were up 10% for the full year. We're driving growth in B2B, up 13% for the quarter and 9% for the year; and in B2C, up 17% for the quarter and 13% for the year. The FICO Scores brand is as strong as it has ever been. Studies show that 90% of consumers recognize the FICO Score and they're increasingly recognizing that the FICO Score is the score that lenders use. We continue to find new opportunities to grow revenue in the consumer space. We've made great progress in adding content around the Scores with Simulators, Score Ingredients, Summary Reports and monitoring. And we're delivering that content through Affinity channels, resellers and education programs by enhanced Open Access content and expanding Open Access to DDA accounts. We look for continued growth in 2018 and beyond. On the B2B side, we're leveraging our decades-long leadership as the score that lenders use to drive innovation and identify new opportunities. We're investing in various Financial Inclusion Initiatives using alternative data and new approaches to bring more consumers into the traditional credit system around the world. In the U.S., we just introduced FICO Score XD 2.0, which scores more than 26 million people who were previously unscorable and 72% of the previously unscorable applications coming into lenders. We've been working in China, India and other markets and have made great progress on Financial Inclusion that will drive real revenue in 2018. And we continue to work on other initiatives to drive more value out of our incredible Scores asset. As we look ahead to 2018, we'll continue to invest in areas of our business where we see the greatest growth potential, and we'll continue to invest in security. In fact, we're substantially increasing our spend in the security space and have added additional personnel and expertise, and we'll continue to make decisions with the interest of our shareholders in mind. In fiscal 2017, we generated a record $205 million in free cash flow, up 10% from the previous year. We deployed much of that in our share repurchase program, returning 1.5 million shares and we purchased an additional 252,000 shares in October, exhausting the current board authorization. We were able to bring basic shares outstanding below 30 million, and today, announced a new board authorization of an additional $250 million. As I look at our business, I see many opportunities in many areas. We're conservative about committing to growth timelines, but I'm convinced we have the right products and the right people to execute on our vision. I'll talk more about our outlook for 2018, but first, I'll turn the call over to Mike for further financial details.
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll emphasize three points in my comments. First, we delivered $253 million of revenue this quarter, up 7% over the same period last year and a total of $932 million for the year, up 6% from the prior year. Second, we delivered $40 million in net income this quarter. Net income for the full year was $128 million. Finally, we delivered $49 million of free cash flow in the quarter and $205 million for the fiscal year. We repurchased 1.5 million shares during the year or about 5% of our outstanding shares. I'll begin by reviewing the results in each of our three reporting segments. Our Applications revenue were $150 million, up 12% from last quarter and up 1% versus the same period last year. Full year revenues for Applications were $553 million, up 4% from last year. The increase in revenue was driven from our recurring businesses, primarily our originations management cloud solutions, our Customer Communication Services and our compliance solutions. In our Decision Management Software segment, revenues were $31 million, up 12% from last quarter and up 29% versus the same period last year. Full year DMS revenues were $113 million, up 5% from last year. DMS bookings were $22 million this quarter, up 44% from the previous year, and our full year DMS bookings were $92 million, up 32% from last year. Finally, in our Scores segment, revenues were a record $72 million, up 4% from last quarter and 15% from the same period last year. B2B was up 13% over the same period last year, driven by strong consumer lending, and B2C revenues were up 17% from the same period last year. For the full year, Scores revenues were $266 million, up 10% from last year. Looking at our revenue by region, this quarter's 71% of total revenue were derived from our Americas region. Our EMEA region generated 20% and the remaining 9% was from Asia Pacific. Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter represented 68% of total revenue. Consulting and implementation revenues were 20% of total and license revenues were 12% of total. For the full year, 70% of our revenues were recurring compared to 69% last year. Our cloud revenue topped $200 million for the year. We generated $24 million of current period revenue on record bookings of $146 million, which is a 16% yield. There were no large whales driving this result. The weighted average term for our bookings was 29 months this quarter. And for the full year, bookings were $429 million, up 13% from the prior year. Our cloud bookings topped $100 million for the year. Our operating expenses totaled $192 million this quarter, up $3 million from the prior quarter. The increase relates primarily to variable expenses associated with increased revenue in the largest booking quarter in company history offset by the restructuring charge we had last quarter. As you can see in our Reg G schedule, non-GAAP operating margin was 32% this quarter and 27% for the year. We expect that operating margin will be somewhere between 26.5% to 28.5% in fiscal 2018. GAAP net income for the quarter was $40 million, up 25% from the prior year. We had a reduction to income tax expense of about $1.2 million or $0.04 a share associated with the Excess Tax Benefits we've been discussing. Our non-GAAP net income was $53 million for the quarter, up 27% from the same quarter last year. For the full year, net income was $128 million, which included $25 million in reduced tax expense from Excess Tax Benefits and non-GAAP net income was $158 million. The effective tax rate for the full year was 15% after adjusting for the Excess Tax Benefit, and the effective rate was about 31.6%, slightly higher than what we guided for the full year due to increased profits in higher tax jurisdictions. Free cash flow for the quarter was $49 million compared to $22 million last year. For the full year, free cash flow was $205 million compared to $186 million last year. Looking at the balance sheet, we had $106 million in cash on the balance sheet. This is down $25 million from last quarter due to debt reduction and share repurchases, partially offset by the cash we generated. Our total debt is now $605 million with a weighted average interest rate of 4%, and our ratio of total net debt to adjusted EBITDA is 2 times, which is below the covenant level of 3 times. We bought back 520,000 shares in the fourth quarter at an average price of $139.94. In fiscal 2017, we repurchased a total of 1.5 million shares at an average price of $131.82, for a total of about $193 million. We continued in the month of October repurchasing an additional 252,000 shares at an average price of $145.20. Those repurchases exhausted the board authorization and we, today, announced a new $250 million authorization. We continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. And we continue to actively evaluate opportunities to acquire relevant technologies and products that advance our strategy or strengthen our portfolio or competitive position. With that, I'll turn it over for Will for his final thoughts.
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: As I said in my opening remarks, I believe we have significant momentum as we move into 2018. Our FICO Score brand is stronger than ever. We have significant opportunities in both the Scores' B2C and B2B markets. On the software side, we'll continue to pursue our DMS strategy. It's the core of our R&D efforts and the core of how we're going to market. We continue to make progress, release new innovation and most importantly, book new business. We're diversifying beyond financial institutions. We're making progress in telco, auto and a number of other verticals. We're still a trusted partner to our financial services clients. But now, we also have so many opportunities in other industries. And we're continuing our cloud-first strategy. I believe 2018 will be the biggest cloud year for FICO ever. We've gone beyond making products cloud ready, we're now designing with a view of cloud-first as we're seeing more demand from both our existing and prospective customers. Our strong bookings in fiscal 2017 give us confidence that as we move into 2018, we're building predictable, reliable backlog that will deliver recurring revenue well into the future. With all this in mind, we're providing the following guidance for fiscal 2018. We're guiding revenues of approximately $990 million, an increase of about 6% versus fiscal 2017. We are guiding GAAP net income of approximately $139 million, up 9% over 2017. We expect an Excess Tax Benefit of $20 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $25 million in fiscal 2017. GAAP earnings per share of approximately $4.33, non-GAAP net income of $171 million and non-GAAP EPS of $5.32. I'll now turn the call back to Steve for Q&A.
Steven P. Weber - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks and we will now take questions. Colin, please open the lines.
Operator: Certainly. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open, please go ahead.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Good evening, gentlemen. My first question is just around your top line guidance of $990 million or 6% growth. Could you maybe walk us through your – or give us some high level guidance around the assumptions by the different segments?
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: Yeah. I'll be happy to, Manav. This is Mike. Good afternoon. We're building our $990 million, I would say, as follows; in our software businesses, we're building an assumption in for Applications of roughly mid-single-digit growing, something very comparable to what we did this year. We're building our guidance around our DMS business in the double-digit range, slightly ahead of what we did this year. And our total Scores business, we have built into roughly mid-single-digit range with relatively flat on the B2B side and high-single-digit growth on the B2C side.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And maybe just honing in on that B2C side, because I know on the B2B, you always do flat which is conservative, but, I guess, the 17% growth this quarter for B2C, I mean, should we be thinking of that as the right run rate, or maybe asked differently, actually, like was the growth there driven – any incremental drivers from the lead-gen business that you started partnering with Experian, or is this still just the legacy base contract you had with them?
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: No, this is the legacy business that we've had. There was very little from the lead-gen, it's starting to kick up, but, frankly, very immaterial at this point. The timing of how quickly the lead-gen business ramps up is still uncertain for us, and it's tied to the marketing efforts at Experian. And so, we've taken a pretty cautious approach to how we build that into these numbers that I'm providing. And so, what you're looking at is the run rate with some of the deals that we described with respect to Affinity and several others beginning to go online.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then on the costs side, could you maybe call out the – maybe the major buckets of investment? You're guiding to basically another flat margin year. Just curious what the main areas therefore, I know Will called out cyber, but anything else?
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: No, I would say what we're seeing certainly in the fourth quarter and what we see in the pipeline for next year is a pretty significant amount of cloud deals. In fact, in the fourth quarter, we had $146 million of bookings, and not quite, but almost half of that were cloud deals and in that, $60 million to $70 million of cloud bookings in our quarter four are going to be implemented throughout the earlier and the middle part of 2018. And that requires people, it requires costs and revenue, obviously, follows that thereafter. So, I would say the mix, because of our fourth quarter bookings, is probably a factor in our margin, certainly, in the first part of next year. And, in addition, as Will mentioned, we've put some extra money aside probably above and beyond what we had done in the past for security and infrastructure in order to build the walls further in terms of our data security and protection.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And on that, again, maybe just my last question, any broad thoughts on if the Equifax breach has or had any impact to your business?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: No. It really hasn't had any impact to our business. Of course, like everyone, we do a gut check and we take a deep look at ourselves to think about whether we're vulnerable and whether we're doing everything that we can to be secure. And, frankly, it was a bit of an impetus for us to increase our budget for our own security. And we were feeling pretty good before and we thought why not feel a little bit better, and that's why we put the extra investment in.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Galinko with Sidoti. Your line is open, please go ahead.
Matthew E. Galinko - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Hey. Good afternoon, guys.
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Hi.
Matthew E. Galinko - Sidoti & Co. LLC: So, I guess, just a point of clarification in terms of increased investment in cyber security, is that internal use or is that also including building out your products?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: The increase in investment that we're referencing was internal use. Now that said, we are also increasing the R&D in our cyber products because they're starting to get a little bit of traction. So, things like the Enterprise Security Score is now up and available. And, so, yeah, there's definitely investment that's going in there, also, on the distribution side for that Score.
Matthew E. Galinko - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Got you. All right. Appreciate that. And then in terms of the cloud-first and just traction you're getting in the cloud, is it coming more from kind of the non-traditional verticals you outlined, or is it really broad based?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: I would say that last year, 2016, and even the beginning of 2017, as expected, the appetite for cloud was in the non-financial services verticals initially, and we expected that, and so, we were seeing appetite in telecom and in other verticals. This year, we've started to see the demand in financial services as well, which for us is a really welcome sign. We always expected this to occur, we never knew what timeframe we'd see our customers move into the cloud in, and to see it actually happening is extremely encouraging. So, I would say, now, it's across the board, it's not just the non-financial services verticals.
Matthew E. Galinko - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Got it. Appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens. Your line is open, please go ahead.
Blake Anderson - Stephens, Inc.: Hi. This is Blake on for Brett. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wondering, if you could talk a little bit more about the very strong bookings, I know you said about half were cloud, and you said there are no whales in there. So, should we assume this is – how should we think about the run rate for 2018 with such a large increase this quarter? And then, maybe, are these taking a little longer on average to implement given the revenue growth of 6% would maybe imply these hitting the P&L next year?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Well, so, we don't really give guidance on bookings. But I think if you were to extrapolate from this quarter and annualize it, you wouldn't be far off and that wouldn't be too optimistic an assumption. We really are feeling very strong about the trend in bookings. And we're at a point now where we've made some efforts to really make our sales people neutral on doing cloud deals versus upfront license deals. We really want to do what the customer wants, and so, there's no – much as we love revenue, we do not have a bias in the system towards revenue. And so, what's happening is through a combination of being even-handed in the way we incent our sales people, coupled with genuine demand from the marketplace, we're really seeing that strong cloud appetite, and we expect that to only increase. And, yes, we absolutely expect that to be reflected in bookings. And it is at the expense of upfront revenue. There's clearly a difference and I think our revenue run rate would be different and higher, if we weren't doing as much cloud business as we are, but we're quite comfortable with that.
Blake Anderson - Stephens, Inc.: All right. And then on the margins, I know you talked about your investments a little bit. And last quarter, you had talked about going through the decision of how much to expand margins this year. Can you just elaborate a little more on that decision for the 26.5% to 28.5% margin? I guess, it's a fairly wide range. What are the drivers of that uncertainty right now?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Well, I think, if you take a step back and you look at the broad strategic direction for our business, we've gone from – we're in the midst of this transformation from a license revenue business to a cloud business. And, initially, if you go back three years, it took the form of cloud-enabling our products, making our products available in the cloud. And what that really meant was, we took our license revenue products and we installed them in our own data centers and made them available on a hosted basis to our customers, and we called that cloud and it is cloud. But that's not the SaaS business, that's not the multi-tenant, highly configurable, standardized, high returns to scale cloud business that we all love. And so, over the last couple of years and especially this year, and especially going into next year, we're making tremendous investments in, not just the infrastructure, the infrastructure is a part of it, making sure that we have the infrastructure to support it, but also the products themselves, rebuilding, retooling, reengineering the products, so that they can be more standardized and highly configurable, which we think is going to reduce the time to go live, reduce the cost of operation, shorten up implementation times and, generally, be a hit with our customers, and that's really where the investment is going. And so, we're – I won't say we're sparing no expense because we still are mindful of making our commitments, but we're very focused on positioning the software business for a future cloud business with much more standardized, highly configurable, scalable products. That's where the investment is going.
Blake Anderson - Stephens, Inc.: All right. That's helpful. And then last one for me would be the FICO Score XD sounds like a good opportunity over time. Any more color you can give on the timing and the size of that revenue growth opportunity? And then, how much competition do you see for that since that's kind of a newer market? Do you think you could take a dominant position in that?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: So, it's not meaningful revenue today and we have not yet announced any big partners who have gone to production with it. But this is definitely the year in which partners will go public with it. It's been in test for quite some time with good results and so, we should be in a position to announce some big partnerships shortly. It is our proprietary Score, we do it with in conjunction with Equifax and the NCTUE data and LexisNexis. And there's – it's not easily replicable by others. Now, there's a lot of efforts in the market to score the unscorable, to use alternative data to score populations that are – have hitherto been difficult to score. But this one has been in development for years and is really robust, really does the job, scores new people, is highly predictive. And from the standpoint of lenders, it's going to result in new business for lenders that they otherwise wouldn't have had. And so, it's pretty strong value proposition, we feel pretty good about it. How big will it be in 2018? I don't know that it'll be tremendously meaningful. It all depends on kind of how quickly the lenders ramp up with it.
Blake Anderson - Stephens, Inc.: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Your line is open, please go ahead.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good afternoon, everyone.
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Hi, Bill.
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: Hi, Bill.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So, I want to start out by asking about the Enterprise Education programs that you had announced last quarter. You mentioned you had two large clients that had signed up for those. Are those starting to ramp, are we seeing some of the benefit in this quarter? Are there any additional takers in the pipeline?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: They are starting to ramp and there are additional takers in the pipeline.
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: It's part of what drove the quarter four growth in the B2C, Bill.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. Okay. And then, on the Enterprise Security Score, last quarter, you talked about having your first large seven-figure deal for that healthcare IT reseller. It doesn't seem like that's much revenue for you now. How has demand been for that product? It would seem post-Equifax breach that that would be a source of – a product with a lot of demand, but I just wanted to see if you're actually seeing that.
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: We're just starting to see it, so we've gotten three deals. There's no question that the – the product does what it's supposed to do. And it's – I don't want to say it's totally unique in the marketplace, but it's a highly credible offering, there's no reason why we couldn't dominate that market. I do think that this is a first-mover kind of a situation, I think it's important for us to invest in that right now to kind of build a franchise. And it will be a scramble over the next 24 months to distinguish our Score from some of the competitors out there. I think, from a predictive standpoint, we have a product that really works and we understand scores and how to make sure the score means something, and we have the brand trust. We have to work on the sales and the distribution to make sure that it gets out there ahead of some of the competition. Again, we're nearly $1 billion revenue business, and so it's not going to be a tremendously meaningful event in 2018. But does it have long-term potential as a very strong franchise? It does.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yeah. And speaking of the Equifax breach, TransUnion had mentioned on their call that they saw a bit of a spike in business in September following the breach. Did you guys see any benefits from that? And if so, did it continue or what are your thoughts there?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: We saw a little bit in myFICO. The activity in myFICO was a little bit up. But, as you know, that's a very small part of our business, so it doesn't have a meaningful impact.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good point. I wanted to go back to the margin guidance that you guys have. You've given color on some of the different drivers on the expense side that are causing the margins to be down on a year-over-year basis and I thought it'd be helpful if maybe you could give some additional quantification of that, meaning you could talk about how 100 basis points is coming from X, 150 basis points is coming from this, if you could give that kind of insight.
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: Sure, Bill. This is Mike. That's a good question. There is close to 100 basis points of margin incremental expense going into the company that relates to the IT security that we described earlier. So, absent that additional investment above and beyond what we've been doing, call it, 50 basis points to 100 basis points higher in terms of the margin, in terms of the guidelines that we gave you. The bigger driver though, frankly, and the reason why there's such a large range, 26.5% to 28.5%, is really the same reason that we had in fiscal 2017 which is, if our mix of business continues to be very heavily kind of oriented or dominated by cloud business, it takes money to put that business in place and get it up and running before the revenue begins to flow. And despite the fact that we had such a large booking year in cloud, probably bigger than we expected, we still kind of landed in the middle of the guidance we gave in 2017, we guided 26% to 28% and we delivered just over 27%. So, it's really the same reasons that are driving the larger size of the range. And then on the margin, there's maybe 50 basis points here and there for some things that are just prudent considering what's happening in the environment around us.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yeah. Another question for you on the debt structure. You have some relatively high-priced debt coming to maturity. In the past, you've talked about the pros and cons of potentially prepaying some of that. Maybe you could review for us where we are in that, how much is refinancing, what the delta is versus current rates?
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: Yeah, I'd be happy to. So, in our notes – these are tied up in our insurance notes. We have about $240-ish million in insurance notes that are sitting on the balance sheet right now. About $130 million of that matures in May and that has over 7% coupon on it. And so, we're going to off board that 7% coupon in May. And it'll get replaced by either our revolver, which is in the 2% to 2.5% rate, or it will end up in some other form of refinancing which is quite possible by the time May comes. The next year after that, we have $28 million due, and the rates are somewhere in the 6% to 6.5% range, I don't remember the exact number. And then, the final coupon of $85 million is due in 2020. That one still has a relatively large May call on it. And so, we're just going to let that one probably sit where it is rather than incur the penalty on the May call. But it's only $85 million out of $600 million. So, we're going to take care a big chunk of this, I think, in May. And we're in the process of thinking through and looking at the best foot forward on that. We ought to see a little bit of improvement on our interest rate as a result.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. So, final question, just wanted to ask about, essentially, the Chinese FICO Score, you guys had – you made some progress in terms of helping to develop a Score in China and then also helping to develop a Score for the unbanked population in China, just see if we could get an update on that.
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: Yeah. So, it's moving along actually quite well. It isn't really tipping the needle in terms of the big picture, but it's helping push that B2B growth to the levels that it has been. We're not quite generating seven figures yet, but next year, we should be well over seven-figures revenue at least if the momentum that we see right now continues through the year. So, we might have a couple of million dollar product in China under current rate and pace. And we're working hard to see if we can improve on that, but it's moving along actually quite well in a country where things don't move very fast.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: And Mr. Weber, there appear to be no further questions on the phone lines. I'll now turn the call back to you. You may continue with your presentation or closing remarks.
Steven P. Weber - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thank you. This concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the call for today. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2017 Q3  (2017-07-31 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Steven P. Weber - Fair Isaac Corp. William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp. Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.
Analysts: Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc. William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc. Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Fair Isaac Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Monday, July 31, 2017. I will now turn the conference over to Steve Weber, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.
Steven P. Weber - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining FICO's third quarter earnings call. I'm Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing, and our CFO, Mike Pung. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular in the Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through July 31, 2018. Now, I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thank you for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. We delivered another solid performance in our third quarter and I'm increasingly confident in our ability to deliver on our full-year guidance. In our third quarter, we reported revenues of $231 million, $25 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $0.78 per share. We delivered $37 million of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS of $1.16. We had a very good bookings quarter with $95 million in deals. That's a 21% increase over the same period last year. And the $35 million in transactions bookings this quarter is a 64% increase over last year. This means we're building more recurring revenue streams that will be realized in future periods. We continue to pursue and sign more and bigger deals. In fact, this was the third straight quarter with bookings of more than $90 million. In our software businesses, revenues were down from last year due to fewer upfront license deals. This is primarily a timing issue and one of the reasons that we give full-year instead of quarterly guidance. The lumpiness of the license sales can overshadow the underlying recurring revenue, which has been growing nicely. Our bookings were balanced across many of our key product lines, including Fraud, Originations Manager, and our Decision Management platform. We continue to see more of our pipeline and bookings related to cloud deals. One notable deal this quarter was one of our cybersecurity offerings, where we signed our first seven-figure deal for our Enterprise Security Score. The deal was with a provider of IT solutions, including cybersecurity services for hospitals and others in the healthcare space. We are still in the early stages with this product, but we are excited about our technology and the opportunities to help our customers protect themselves and their consumers. The big story this quarter is our Scores business, where we continue to make significant progress on our strategic initiatives and are adding new revenue sources to our B2C business. We drove solid growth throughout Scores, with total revenues up 14% versus the prior year. B2B revenues were up 13% for the quarter as we continued to see strong volume trends. Our B2C revenues were up 16% this quarter versus last year. On the B2B side, we had very strong volumes, as the demand for FICO scores in the U.S. continues to grow. One of the fastest areas of growth is fintech, as well as new verticals like telco. We also had some exciting developments on the B2B side this quarter. A top-10 bank went live with our FICO Score XD, a product to score the previously unscorable. And we're seeing our first revenue from our global financial inclusion initiative with usage in China. Neither XD nor financial inclusion will have a material impact this year, but both can provide growth in fiscal 2018 and beyond. As I've said for the last several quarters, we have a lot going on in our Consumer Scores business. We are continuing to find new ways to monetize FICO Scores, the scores that are used by lenders, in products marketed to consumers. Those scores are a significant component in paid credit monitoring and identity theft protection products, like those sold at myFICO.com and through our partnership with Experian. We are pursuing the white label affinity market with deals like we signed last quarter. We've entered the lead gen space with deals that have gone live over the past several months. And we just signed another lead gen deal with a large card issuer that will be rolling out in the coming months. Finally, we are now seeing demand for more content from banks that have rolled out the highly successful Open Access program. As a result, we've recently signed deals with two different issuers to provide additional educational information for consumers. These new deals will likely have little impact in the last three months for our fiscal year, but they will provide important recurring backlog as we enter fiscal 2018. As always, we remain focused on driving shareholder value. We're actively managing our expenses and generating significant free cash flow. That discipline has allowed us to repurchase $140 million in shares so far this year. I'm pleased with the progress we're making executing on our strategy and I believe that we're well-positioned as we finish our year and look ahead to 2018. I'll share some summary thoughts later, but now I'd like to turn call over to Mike for further financial details.
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. Today I'll emphasize three points in my prepared comments. First, we delivered $231 million of revenue this quarter, with recurring revenue up 8% from last year, which was partially offset by a large decline in upfront license revenue. Revenue of $679 million year-to-date is up 5% from last year, again driven by a 7% increase in recurring revenue. Second, we delivered $25 million of GAAP net income this quarter and $88 million year-to-date, and are on track to delivering our guidance. Finally, we had $67 million of free cash flow this quarter and $155 million year-to-date. We used $46 million to repurchase shares and have spent $140 million on repurchases this fiscal year. I'll begin by breaking the revenue down into our three reporting segments. Starting with Applications, revenues were $134 million, down 5% versus the same period last year, which had record license sales. We had a strong revenue quarter in our Customer Communication Services and Compliance product lines. Year-to-date, Applications are up 5% over last year, primarily driven by growth in recurring revenue. We had a very strong bookings quarter in Applications with $62 million of deals, up 26% from last year. In the Decision Management Software segment, revenues were $28 million, down 23% from the prior year. The decline was due to lower upfront license sales, primarily Blaze Advisor. Bookings continued to be strong in this segment at $21 million. Year-to-date bookings are $70 million, up 29% over last year. And finally, in our Scores segment, revenues were about $70 million, up 14% from the same period last year. On the B2B side, we're up 13% versus last year. The B2C revenues were up 16% from the same quarter last year. As Will stated, we have a number of Scores initiatives coming online that will further propel growth in this space. Looking at revenue by region, this quarter's 74% of total revenues were derived from the Americas. Our EMEA region generated 17%, and the remaining 9% was from Asia-Pacific. Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter represented 72% of total revenue. Consulting and implementation revenues were 19%, and license revenues were 9% of total. We expect license revenue to increase in quarter four due to a combination of new deals with upfront revenue and some expected license renewals. Bookings this quarter were $95 million, up 21% from the prior-year quarter. We generated $19 million of current period revenue on those bookings for a yield of 19%. The weighted average term for our bookings was 29 months this quarter. We continue to book more large deals. This quarter we had 14 deals over $1 million, and we booked three deals over $3 million. Cloud bookings were $15 million for the quarter and $41 million year-to-date, or 14% of total. Operating expenses totaled $190 million this quarter, compared to $188 million last quarter. This included a $4 million restructuring charge, as we reallocated some of our resources towards our highest strategic priorities. We expect our fourth quarter expense to be slightly lower than our third quarter. As you can see in our Reg G schedule, our non-GAAP operating margin was 28% for the second quarter and 26% year-to-date. We expect the full-year operating margin to be between 26% to 28%. GAAP net income was $25 million and included a reduction to income tax expense of just under $3 million or $0.08 per share, associated with the adoption of FASB accounting standards update 2016-09. Adjusting for that impact, the effective tax rate was about 36% due to increased profits in higher tax jurisdictions. Non-GAAP net income was $37 million for the quarter. We expect our actual tax rate to be 17%to 18% for the full year, which includes the impact of the new accounting standard. Free cash flow for the quarter was $67 million versus $80 million in the prior year. And for the first three quarters of the fiscal year, free cash flow was $155 million. Turning to the balance sheet, we had $131 million of cash on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. Our total debt is $612 million with a weighted average interest rate of 4.3%. And the ratio of total net debt to adjusted EBITDA this quarter is 2.1 times, well below the covenant level of 3 times. We expanded our revolver this quarter, increasing our capacity to $500 million, and have used this to refinance the $72 million in notes that matured in July. We expect to refinance our total debt sometime in fiscal 2018. During the quarter, we returned $46 million in excess cash to our investors, repurchasing 340,000 shares at an average price of $134.92. In addition, we repurchased another 140,000 shares for $20 million in July, leaving about $90 million remaining on the total board authorization. And we continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of our cash. We also continue to actively evaluate opportunities to acquire relevant technologies and products that advance our strategy, our strength in our portfolio and competitive position. Finally, we're updating our previously provided guidance to adjust for the third quarter impact of the new accounting standard. We are now guiding the full fiscal 2017 as follows: Revenues remain at approximately $925 million. GAAP net income previously guided at $130 million is now adjusted by the third quarter excess tax benefit to a new total of approximately $133 million. GAAP earnings per share previously guided at $4.03 is now approximately $4.11. Non-GAAP net income remains unchanged at $158 million and non-GAAP EPS is unchanged at $4.92. With that, I'll turn it back over to Will.
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thanks, Mike. Next quarter we'll talk about our expectations for 2018, but for now I'd like to review what we've been able to accomplish in 2017. In Scores, we're making significant progress in leveraging our B2B leadership into the consumer market. We're signing deals and are looking forward to seeing further, steady, sustainable growth. On the software side, our SaaS-enabled products and Decision Management suite technology are gaining traction and opening new markets. The bookings we are now signing are building substantial future recurring revenue flows. We are well-positioned for 2018 and beyond. We have extraordinarily valuable IP, a long heritage of our analytic prowess, and a very talented team to make the most of our opportunities. I'll turn the call back to Steve now for Q&A.
Steven P. Weber - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks and we're ready now to take your questions. Operator, please open the lines.
Operator: Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you. Good evening, gentlemen. It looks like you explained a lot of, I guess, your numbers relative to what we had as timing differences around license deals and so forth. Maybe asked another way, in terms of your segment expectations for the full year, particularly maybe on the DMS side, like, what should we think about what that should look like? Is one doing better than the expectations and one lesser maybe? Just maybe some color there would be helpful.
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: Yeah. Manav, this is Mike. So, as the year is shaping up, I would call it the following: So, Scores and our Applications business are probably exceeding where we thought they would be in terms of top-line revenue. And I would say DMS is falling below where we thought it would be on top-line revenue, but in line, maybe a little bit better on bookings.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then maybe could you just elaborate on DMS then? Like, what's going on there? Because I think you guys are obviously hiring sales people to help with that effort. There was a lot of positive talk on it through the years. So is it just timing or is there something else going on there?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Manav, I would say it's just timing. We're as excited about DMS as we've ever been. We are putting a ton of resource into DMS, not just in sales but across the board. All of the R&D activity is really pointed in that direction. And so it's kind of a question of when it happens. But we're actually highly confident about the future of DMS.
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: Yeah. Manav, said another way, it's all upfront software basically that is the shortfall in that area and that's offset by the transactional volume increases in Scores and in the Apps part of our business.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Got it. And then, just one more. On the Scores side, can you maybe give a little bit more color on the backlog you're talking about going into 2018, and maybe just some perspective on the lead gen initiative you have going on with Experian? Would you say that's sort of – I think they just launched that effort obviously recently. So how should we think about the runway left there?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: To answer the second one first, with respect to the lead gen, we really rely heavily on our partner, Experian, and the timing of their efforts there. We are very much joined with them in partnership and in advancing ahead. And we're really happy with the value proposition, which is clearly the strongest value proposition in the market. As we've discussed in the past, in addition to providing the genuine FICO Score to consumers, which is a substantial improvement over what all the competitors do, we also take into account the lender's lending criteria and match that carefully with what we know about the consumers who come. And so the breakage in terms of the lead gen is much, much lower than with competitors. And so we're feeling really good about the value proposition. And it's just been launched, and so time will tell how that performs. And so we have high expectations for 2018 obviously, but it depends on kind of how things go there. And then we mentioned backlog with respect to FICO Score XD and some of the other initiatives that are just getting started right now. So there's no significant revenue to show for them right now, but we're feeling good about the future of those. And again, we'll see how the market takes them, but early results are promising.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good afternoon, everyone.
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Hey, Bill.
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: Hi, Bill.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So the first question I had was on the B2C Scores business, the new education scores you referenced. Maybe give us a little more color on how those work, what the revenue model is?
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: Yeah. Bill, this is Mike. So what we did this quarter is we announced a couple of new deals where an existing Open Access customer of ours, a bank, is going to be adding additional features to their offering for their consumers, basically expanding additional educational information into the offering beyond what they get with the Open Access program. Those features and capabilities, there are often additional reason codes and a simulator, and information to that degree that helps the consumer understand their credit position more thoroughly, are paid for by the bank to FICO, but are provided as part of the relationship that the bank has with its customer. Those deals were just signed. We really didn't claim anything, if you will, from that at this point. That'll be kind of ratable revenue as it rolls out across the Open Access platforms.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So, when do you expect that to actually go live at the banks?
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: It'll differ from bank-to-bank in terms of how quickly they roll it out across their portfolio. So I can't give you like a specific date, but I'm imagining it'll start to feather in beginning here in our fourth quarter and, more importantly, into the winter months.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. And then I wanted to ask also about the Cybersecurity Score. That sounded like sort of a proof-of-concept win, if you will. Maybe you can give us a little more detail in terms of what the revenue model is there and how you think about the revenue opportunity?
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: Yeah. So this is kind of a basic reseller for us. It's, as we said in our prepared remarks, a health care provider – IT provider to the healthcare industry. And they offer a number of products, including now some additional cyber products, the ESS Score from FICO, and they'll be selling it to their end customers. The way the economics work for us essentially is that the fee that will be charged to the healthcare provider by this reseller of ours will be based on their number of endpoints. Number of points like computer terminals, or phone terminals, or whatnot. They're commonly called endpoints. And there's a grid that they pay based upon the number of endpoints and the number of employees the end customer has. And we do a very simple revenue share with the reseller. They keep a piece and they pay us a piece for that.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. And so, on the implied EPS guidance for Q4, I just wanted to check something with you. The last year was kind of an unusual year in that Q3 was as strong as it was in pull some revenue forward from Q4. If I go back 2014, 2015, it looks like the sequential increase from Q3 to Q4 was running in like the 55 to 60% range. So is the conclusion there that basically 2006 was an aberration and now you're returning to more of the seasonal pattern that you've had in prior years? Is that the message?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: You could definitely take that away from the way the numbers are falling out. But I would just say that we don't focus that carefully quarter-to-quarter. The truth is that we really think about our business on kind of an annual run rate basis and we get near the end of the quarter, and of course, everyone in this company is scrambling to try to deliver revenue by quarter-end. We're a software company like every other software company. But the place where we're not like every other software company is, it is rare that we want to provide incremental discount or make concessions in order to rush the revenue into the quarter. And so we do wind up in situations where these deals, which are increasingly complex and take longer to sort out, slide from one quarter to the next. And so, this year, I think that that conclusion that you've drawn is accurate. And I would just say, in general, that the revenue comes when it comes. We try to bring it in, we try to bring in kind of a rational way, and we don't rush it. We take our time to do it right.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And one more question, if I might, on the Experian relationship. On their call, they had mentioned the strength on both the identity protection side and the lead gen product side. And they had mentioned that they were in the process of rolling that out more aggressively during the September quarter. And they made some comments around the Experian website seeing traffic that was converting well and that the revenue generation on those leads was very strong. And so my question is, do we see some of the benefit of that flowing through already in the June quarter? Or is that really going to be coming in more the September quarter and beyond?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Not really in the past, in the current, and more in the future. But as go their fortunes, so go ours. That is accurate.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. All right. Well, thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Thank you. Congrats on a nice bookings quarter. One question that I had on guidance, just want to make sure that I understand it. I know that you guys don't discount, and I think holding firm on price is obviously a really good thing. But knowing what we know now, do we need to be thinking about deals that might slip for the full year on that $925 million revenue? Any more risk there than they normally might have, just based on what you're seeing?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: No. I would say, Brett, that the reason we confirmed guidance at $925 million is that's what we feel pretty good about and I think that's what you should focus on.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And then the Open Access cross-sale of the additional value to product sounds really interesting. Have you kind of contemplated or shared at all what kind of penetration you think you might be able to get of those banks that use Open Access, or sort of size that for us? Because I know Open Access doesn't officially generate revenue, but I think it does increase score usage sort of indirectly. This seems like the first sort of more direct revenue from that. And given the broad adoption of Open Access, how do you guys think about that in terms of size of opportunity?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Yeah. Great question, Brett, and I'm glad you gave us an opportunity to kind of clarify. So, as you noted, we don't charge for Open Access, and it's very much designed to be available to consumers with no charge. Of course, it was our hope always that financial institutions would be interested in sharing more about credit, more about the FICO Score, more about consumer capabilities and capacities and how to influence those things. And it was our hope that we would be able to monetize them. The most aggressive form of that monetization comes in the form of paid subscription offerings, which we do with myFICO.com, but we largely do with our partner, Experian. And the question has always been which direction the financial institutions would go. Would they favor kind of the paid offerings and the fee income that comes with that? Or would they treat it as more of a customer relationship strengthening, free content kind of a thing? And it was never really clear which way the market was going to evolve. And I think what we see is both. But we're pleasantly pleased with the market receptivity to the idea of increasing content for consumers for free, because it means that they go out to all of their consumers, not just a subset. And we do think that the kind of raising awareness about FICO Scores that has occurred because of Open Access is getting the banks into a mode of thinking, how do they provide more credit content, and FICO credit simulator, and so on to all of their customers. And we're obviously working with them on that.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Great. That's helpful. And then last one from me. You talked a little bit about the DMS deals in the pipeline and the bookings were good. I know we have the big telco deal and that seems to be going well. And I think you said that you felt that was kind of a repeatable product in that industry. Based on how good the bookings are, is there a pattern emerging in terms of what verticals are most assimilating this product, or are there specific use cases that are sort of emerging as the killer app? Any trends there yet?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: I think that the most natural candidates, beyond financial institutions that are interested in our IP and in our offerings, are customers that have a large consumer base and a building relationship. They have some kind of customer acquisition activity that resembles originations. They have a customer management activity that resembles what we do at TRIAD with banks. They have billing and receivables that they have to manage with consumers that cause them to have a need for collections and recovery, just like banks do. And if they're involved with transactions, they obviously have an interest in fraud detection. And so, when you look at the kind of key IP that we provide to banks, where we're best-in-class for banks, you have other verticals that are focused on these same activities: telcos, utilities, cable companies, and power companies. And there's a very natural play there. And so, in the fullness of time, we anticipate growth in those verticals. But those aren't the only ones. Obviously, it goes beyond that. It goes to retailers and online e-commerce retailers too. So, pattern emerging is – the easiest way to predict it is to say, what is it that we do well for the financial institutions that we serve today and who has the most natural need for the same kind of thing. And we are seeing success with that.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Great. Thank you for your time.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Klauber with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Oh, thanks. Good afternoon. One or two questions. First one on expense and margin. As you've sort of let us know that over the last year or so you had this step-up in expenses, as you've been investing in sales and infrastructure. I guess, going forward, are there any initiatives that would cause a major step-up as we look forward over the near term, the next 12 months? And if not, is it possible that 2018 could be more margin-accretive than 2017?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: That's a great question, Adam. So there's no particular categories that are looking like big step-up in expenses in the near- and intermediate-term, and I can't speak to the long-term. But certainly, in the near future, we don't see anything that would be a big uptick. In terms of margin expansion, this is what we wrestle with every day. We're in our 2018 planning cycle right now. We're wrestling with how much to increase margin and how much to reinvest in the business, and it is, frankly, a choice. There is certainly margin that could flow through in terms of market expansion, should we choose to do that. And if we decide to not do that a lot or not do it at all, it will be because the investment opportunities are quite compelling. And so you've caught us a little bit early in the planning cycle. We haven't given guidance for 2018 yet. I'm fairly confident that we're looking at neutral to improved margin for next year, not a shrinkage, but how much margin expansion remains to be determined.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then, on the Scores, B2B growth, and I'm sorry if you mentioned this before, was pretty strong. What was driving that this quarter?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Adam, a lot of it was volume. We've had good volume increases with some of the big banks, especially on the pre-screen side. We also are picking up volume through fintech and some telco providers, call that new volume for us. And then there was a little bit of price increase in there from some of the smaller lenders that all netted into the number.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then, as far as the XD effort, again great news that the first one is coming through. Are there a couple others near the finish line? Or is it more of one's going to jump in and then the others maybe take a look and maybe eventually jump in?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: It's really up to the financial institution when they want to deploy in production. So, typically the rhythm is that they take it in-house, they evaluate it, they decide that it's interesting because it scores a population they don't otherwise score. They decide to test it for a period of time, and then they make a go/no-go decision. So far, no one has ever said no-go. So far we're in the introduction, the education and the testing mode. We've got one that's decided to go live, one big one trying to go live, and we expect that there will be others that follow. But we're still on that getting to know the score and evaluate it phase.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to the presenters.
Steven P. Weber - Fair Isaac Corp.: Okay. That concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining us.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

===== 2017 Q2  (2017-04-29 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Steven Weber - VP, IR Will Lansing - CEO Mike Pung - EVP and CFO
Analysts: Brett Huff - Stephens Manav Patnaik - Barclays Bill Warmington - Wells Fargo Adam Klauber - William Blair Matthew Galinko - Sidoti
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fair Isaac Corporation quarterly earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Steve Weber. Mr. Weber, you may begin.
Steven Weber: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining FICO's second quarter earnings call. I'm Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike Pung. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular in the Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through April 27, 2018. Now I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
Will Lansing: Thanks Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. We're now halfway through our fiscal year, and I'm happy to report that we're driving growth in each of our three segments. In our second quarter, we reported revenues of 228 million, an increase of 10% over the same period last year. We delivered 25 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $0.78 per share. We delivered 34 million of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS of $1.05. And again this quarter, we're delivering balanced growth throughout our business. Our Scores segment was up 7% over the same period last year. Our Applications segment was up 10%, and our Decision Management Software was up 21%. In Applications, revenues were up 10% over the prior year. This is particularly notable as this segment includes many of our more mature products, but we're continuing to drive growth with our Fraud Solutions. And the investments we've made to cloud-enable our other products, like Originations Solutions, have opened new markets, leading to growth. We've also been able to drive growth from acquisitions like Adeptra and TONBELLER. These products are growing 16% and 32%, respectively, year-to-date. In our Decision Management Software, the investments we've made continue to pay dividends. Revenues were up 21% versus the prior year, with particularly good results in our Blaze Advisor and Decision Optimizer products. Bookings this quarter were up 67% over last year. We have a strong pipeline of opportunities in this space and are excited about growth prospects. In the Scores business, it was another quarter of good growth, and we also had some important developments. Revenues were up 7% versus the prior year, with B2C revenues up 16%. As we've been saying, we have a lot going on in this space and we expect revenue growth, particularly on the consumer side, to continue to accelerate as a number of initiatives go live later this year. The expanded agreement announced last quarter with Experian is still in early stages, and we expect to begin seeing its impact as the program rolls out. We also signed some new consumer agreements in second quarter, including an affinity deal for a major card issuer. While these deals will take time to go live and will have little impact on fiscal '17, they will be contributors to fiscal '18 growth, and we are doing exciting things to promote financial inclusion throughout the world. We're working on initiatives in places like China, Peru, India, the Philippines and Russia to help 850 million consumers who are currently credit invisible. These efforts parallel what we're doing in the U.S., leveraging new alternative data sources to help unbanked consumers find a path to access credit. These initiatives will not have an immediate impact on Scores revenue, but they're important in solidifying the brand globally and then laying the groundwork for possible future growth. On the B2B side, we continue to see positive signs. Year-to-date revenues are up 5% from the previous year, and the current economic conditions bode well for moderate sustained growth. And we remain focused on driving shareholder value. We've repurchased nearly 75 million in shares halfway through our fiscal year. And we actively manage our business to efficiently allocate resources, expand margins and continue to accelerate free cash flows. I'll share some summary thoughts later, but now I'd like to turn the call back over to Mike for further financial details.
Mike Pung: Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll emphasize 3 points in my comments. First, we delivered $228 million of revenue, an increase of $22 million or 10% year-over-year. Our cloud revenue was $50 million, up 9% from last year. Second, we delivered $25 million of GAAP net income, up 9% year-over-year. And finally, we had $61 million of free cash flow this quarter, and we used $44 million of it to repurchase shares. I'll begin by breaking the revenue down into our 3 reporting segments. Starting with Applications. Revenues were $134 million, up 10% versus the same period last year. We had a strong quarter in Fraud Solutions, Originations and in our Customer Communication Services product lines. Our application bookings of $49 million is down from last year, when we had a record quarter, but still represent a solid quarter, and we continue to have a strong pipeline of potential deals. In the Decision Management Software segment, revenues were $29 million, up 21% versus the prior year. The increase this quarter was driven by Services revenues and Decision Optimization and Blaze Advisor sales. Bookings continue to be strong in this segment at $23 million, representing a 67% increase over the same period last year. Year-to-date, revenues in this segment are up 14% and bookings are up 46%. We continue to build transactional volumes which will give us predictable recurring revenue streams. And finally, in our Scores segment, revenues were $65 million, up 7% from the same period last year. On the B2B side, we're up 2% versus last year, which included a true-up of under-reported royalties. The B2C revenues were up 16% from the same quarter last year. We expect continued growth from both B2B and B2C in the back half of the year based on current trends and as new opportunities go online. Looking at revenues by region. This quarter's 75% of total revenues were derived from the Americans. Our EMEA region generated 18% and the remaining 7% from Asia Pacific. Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter represented 71% of total revenue. Consulting and implementation revenues were 18%, and license revenues were 11% of total. Bookings this quarter were $91 million, down 31% from the prior year quarter, when we had a record booking quarter. We generated $21 million of current period revenues on those bookings for a yield of 23%. The weighted average term for our bookings was 26 months this quarter. We continue to book more large deals. This quarter, we had 13 deals over $1 million, and we booked six deals over 3 million. In fact, in the first two quarters, we booked 13 deals over 3 million, more than the 10 we booked all of last year. Operating expenses totaled 188 million this quarter compared to 185 million in the first quarter. We expect to maintain our current cost run rate over the back half of the year, while actively allocating our resources to our highest strategic priorities. As you can see in our Reg G schedule, our non-GAAP operating margin was 25% for the second quarter and 25% year-to-date. We expect some margin expansion in the back half of the year, and that the full year operating margin will be 26% to 28%. GAAP net income this quarter was $25 million and included a reduction to income tax expense of about $4 million or $0.11 a share associated with the adoption of FASB standard number 2016-09. Adjusting for that impact, the effective tax rate was about 35% due to increased profits and higher tax jurisdictions. Non-GAAP net income was 34% for the quarter, down 3% from the same quarter last year. We expect the unaffected or normal tax rate to be about 30% for the full year before any impact of the stock-based comp change. The free cash flow for the quarter was $61 million, which included the impact from the new accounting standard. On a comparable basis, free cash flow was 38 million in the prior year. For the trailing 12 months, free cash flow was $191 million. Turning to the balance sheet. We had 116 million in cash on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. Our total debt is 626 million, with a weighted average interest rate of about 4.2%. The ratio of our total net debt to adjusted EBITDA this quarter is 2.1 times, below the covenant level of 3. During the quarter, we returned $44 million in excess cash to our investors, repurchasing 348,000 shares at an average price of $126.97. We have about 155 million remaining on the latest board authorization, and continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. We also continue to actively evaluate opportunities to acquire relevant technologies and products that advance our strategy or strengthen our portfolio and competitive position. Finally, we're updating our previously provided guidance to adjust for the second quarter impact of the new accounting standard on share-based comp. We are not including any impact in future quarters until they are known. We are now guiding the full fiscal 2017 as follows: revenues remain at approximately 925 million; GAAP net income, previously guided at 126 million, is now adjusted to the new total of approximately 130 million; GAAP earnings per share is now approximately $4.03; non-GAAP net income remains unchanged at 158 million; and non-GAAP earnings per share is unchanged at $4.92 per share. With that, I'll turn it back over to Will.
Will Lansing: Thanks, Mike. Halfway through our fiscal year, I'm very pleased with our progress. We have a very strong team in place, which is solidly executing on our strategy. We're driving sustainable balance growth throughout our portfolio and building a backlog of recurring transactional revenue. And we're seeing evidence that there's demand for the new products we've been investing in. At the same time, we're focused on expense management and margin expansion as we continue to deliver increasingly strong cash flows. I'll now turn the call back to Steve for Q&A.
Steven Weber: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we're ready now to take any questions you may have. Operator, please open the lines.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Brett Huff from Stephens.
Brett Huff: Just a quick follow-up on the bookings, it sounds like you had a good Applications quarter. Can you just give us any detail on the kind of win it was? Was it a renewal with expansions? Was it a new logo? It sounds like it was a larger fraud deal. Just any detail on that would be helpful.
Mike Pung: Yes, Brett, in our Applications business, we had strong bookings, really, across the board. I wouldn't say there was any one particular product line that stood out over any others. We typically see larger bookings numbers in areas like fraud banking, which is where we have Falcon, and in our Originations business, where we are seeing a lot of demand for the new Originations manager product we've released.
Brett Huff: Okay, that's helpful. And then any update on the DMS? I know we've got a big telco under our belt. How is that implementation going? I think it went live recently. Any update from that customer? And then in terms of pipeline, you mentioned that a couple of times, any thoughts or insight on the DMS part of that pipeline that you can tell us about?
Will Lansing: So on the telco deal, it's going smoothly, and we're really happy with the progress to date. And DMS pipeline continues to improve every day, a little bit stronger than the day before.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays.
Manav Patnaik: I just wanted to hash out the performance in the Scores business a little bit more. So first on the B2B side, I think you said 2% growth. Can you just explain that? I thought that could have been better than that. And then on the B2C side, maybe you could you give us a little bit more color between myFICO.com and the different pieces of Experian there?
Mike Pung: Sure, Manav. So on the B2B side, we did report 2% growth. You got to realize, last year, we had a true-up of an underpaid royalty that affected last year's number. So if I would pull that out and set it off to the side on an apples-and-apples basis, without that number, the growth rate on the B2B side was between 8% and 9%. In terms of B2C, we had a very strong quarter, 16% growth. Much of it coming through our indirect partner channel. If I look back and take a quick look at our myFICO business, it grew mid-single digits, with the rest of it coming through new products that are starting to go online in our relationship with Experian.
Manav Patnaik: And that relationship with Experian, you had the legacy piece of it and then the new lead gen piece of it. Is that something you guys can parse out and see the growth from the different areas? And has the -- would you say a lot of that 16% came from the newer side of things?
Mike Pung: No, the rollout of the lead gen side is just getting underway. The deal was announced on our last call at the end of January, and so very little impact has been reflected in our numbers so far for that, which means the rest of it by default would come from the legacy agreement we had with them on the consumer side.
Manav Patnaik: Okay, and then, Will, just broadly, I mean, we've talked before about how you guys need to invest in the infrastructure or whether that sale, support services or cloud offerings and so forth for all the different things you guys are working on, particularly DMS. Maybe just any color there. Is it more of the same? There's still a lot left to go? Just some thoughts there.
Will Lansing: There's definitely investments still left to go. I think that what we're seeing is that the market appetite in and outside of the financial services sector for cloud offerings is increasing, and it's increasing very rapidly. So I would say that we're happy that we've invested as much as we have to date in terms of getting our products cloud ready and hardening our cloud infrastructure, but we're not finished. And if anything, I think we're accelerating our plans in terms of being cloud-ready for whatever the market demands. So we're not at a point where those investments are tapering off and you can expect margin expansion, at least not yet.
Manav Patnaik: Okay. And then just last one for me. I guess, we've just seen a bit of PR from you, but is the cybersecurity score something to talk about now or is it just early?
Will Lansing: In terms of revenue dollars and material contribution to FICO's revenue and profit profile, it's definitely early. In terms of opportunity, it's quite interesting. We have couple of things to work with. One is the IP surrounding what we bring to the cybersecurity game. And the second is our brand for Scores. I mean, FICO as a brand stands for respected, trusted, neutral, science-based evaluation of risk. And applied to the enterprise equity space, we had a great opportunity. That market is still wide open. As you know, we made an acquisition in that space recently, and we're pleased with it so far. We're doing additional development and efforts around it right now. But in terms of accounting to dollars, it's very early.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Bill Warmington: So congratulations on the Affinity win. I had a couple of questions about it. You mentioned it was a credit card issuer. So I wanted to ask whether this was what would be called like a traditional Affinity deal? Meaning that you're going to do monthly credit card, credit report, credit score, credit file monitoring or whether this was more of an educational program type deal?
Will Lansing: This is more the former than the latter. I hesitate to call it the traditional Affinity business. But it's the Affinity business that we originally envisioned where through major partner players, we bring the FICO scores part of monthly monitoring by subscription kind of an offering out to the market. And so it has been a long time in coming, but there's a major player and we're quite excited about the prospects.
Bill Warmington: Now is this going to be done on a white-label basis or will we actually see you guys as the implementer?
Will Lansing: You -- well, it's a combination of us and others. But you will certainly see our brand there in a very prominent way.
Bill Warmington: Okay. And then I wanted to ask about the demand you're seeing from credit card issuers in general. It seems like you're basically providing a couple of different solutions on the Score side in terms of providing for lead gen solutions and also retention solutions. And the credit card banks have come out with some reasonably aggressive goals for 2017 in terms of their credit card unit growth. So I wanted to ask whether you're seeing that demand remain pretty stable, whether you're seeing it pick up or slow down versus maybe where it was three months ago.
Will Lansing: I would say, stable to up. I think that what you're seeing is absolutely right, which is there's a lot of activity in the marketplace. And I think that increasingly issuers are recognizing that the FICO brand and FICO Credit Score and the things wrapped around it are a differentiator and are valued by the market. So we're more involved than ever in efforts to win new customers and to retain old ones.
Bill Warmington: Okay. And then on the DMS side, last year was a year of investment in terms of growing the sales force. I think it had gone from around 10 or so in the early part of the year up to about 50. I wanted to ask, where that sales force was now? How the productivity was? And whether you feel like you've started to see the acceleration in the bookings there that you were hoping for?
Will Lansing: So there are few things going on in our DMS business. One is, when we talked about DMS-dedicated sales, it really takes kind of two forms. One is, most of our sales force is organized around reaching business leaders, Credit Risk Officers, Business Unit Heads. Basically, the business owner. And the idea with some of the dedicated DMS sales was that we would also go after the IT shop and after the CIO, kind of demonstrating the value and extensibility of the DMS platform. As this thing has evolved, we've decided -- we continue to obviously serve the CIO and the IT side, but we've decided to broaden the DMS effort so that it's not just the people focus and specialize on DMS, but our generalized sales force is increasingly becoming equipped to explain the value -- the DMS value proposition to customers and obviously they can bring in specialized sales people, presales people as needed. But our ability to take DMS to market, we're now in an effort to broaden it and have it go to our broader sales force and not just specialized DMS sales people.
Bill Warmington: And so what are we looking in terms of headcount for sales approximately these days?
Will Lansing: I think you have to think of it as unchanged. We are adding heads as fast as we can to get the qualified people that we can. But we're not -- I don't feel like we're at a tremendous deficit. I think we're in a constant mode of renewal, we're adding new people and cutting lower performers. And I think you'll see gradual, very gradual incremental increase over time. But we don't feel like we're at a big deficit and we're not in a giant growth push on headcount.
Bill Warmington: Okay, and then I wanted to ask, in terms of -- the revenue growth came in strong for the quarter, the margins were down year-over-year. I wanted to just double-check, you've addressed some of the issues, but I wanted to double back on that in terms of is it a function of mix? Is it a function on the revenue side? Is it a function of investments that you're making in the cloud preparation? What's the dynamic there?
Mike Pung: Yes, Bill, I think the dynamic you're seeing is there was a step function in investment, mainly in sales and distribution that happened last year in our third quarter. That's when we really begin to step up the additional sales heads that we were adding. And, obviously, those sales heads weren't there in our second quarter last year, and you'll see them in our SG&A numbers in this year's second quarter. On top of that or beside that, but to a lesser degree, we put some money into our operations team that we had budgeted and planned for and spoke about at the beginning of the year. So the run rate, if you go back and look from probably quarter three last year, has been pretty stable in terms of expense. The step-up function happened between quarter two and three last year.
Bill Warmington: Got it. Makes sense. And then final question for me was just to touch on the free cash flow; that seemed particularly strong in this quarter. And just wanted to understand what the component to that were?
Mike Pung: Yes, the big source of cash this quarter is our DSO. A drop from what's kind of traditionally been 65 days down to somewhere around 56 or 57 days. And those eight or nine days, if you think about it, one day in a DSO is $2.5 million. And if you have pickup eight or nine days, that's $20-plus million of cash flow. We just had very strong collections across virtually every part of the world we operate in, and that spiked the number quite a bit.
Bill Warmington: You're starting to use your own collections product in-house with Adeptra?
Will Lansing: Hey, you got it.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Adam Klauber from William Blair. Your line is open.
Adam Klauber: Just one or two. Applications, you had some good wins. Are those a combination of existing and new clients? And if I remember, last quarter, you were having some success internationally there, did that continue to follow in this quarter?
Mike Pung: Yes, Adam. So it is a combination. We we've had some very nice wins in our Fraud business, especially in Latin America, over the last couple of quarters. We had a large renewal this quarter in Fraud, which helped the Applications business as well. And we're also seeing a host of new customers that bought Origination Manager from us in the cloud, starting to go online and we're starting to see the revenue flowing through from that. Those are two probably the strongest areas. And beyond that, on the upside, our CCS business, which is the old Adeptra business we acquired a few years back. We're starting to see more and more customers come online on that across the world as well, with particular strength in Asia and North America. So it's a mixed group, but it's across a couple of pretty important product lines for us.
Adam Klauber: Okay. And then a sort of similar question on the Tools side but more core of financial vertical versus nonfinancials, I guess. How is the mix of sales going there?
Mike Pung: Yes. This quarter, we had a couple of strong license deals that were outside of financial services that drove a nice increase in revenue. And then we had kind of the typical deals, especially on the optimization side. One of the real successes so far for us internally here is our optimization practice. We signed an incredibly large mortgage optimization deal this quarter. It's not upfront license, but it's a lot of services and some ongoing licenses. We signed that one down in Asia-Pacific. And we've also, over the course of the year, signed several credit line optimization deals, which are just very nice big and important deals for the banks and nice margin deals for the company. So those have been kind of highlight areas, as I would call them.
Adam Klauber: Okay, okay. And then on B2C on Scores, obviously, a good quarter. You have some of the deals ramping up towards the end of the year. So is this growth level in the range sustainable? Or is for some reason was 2Q just a little too high in B2C?
Mike Pung: Quarter 2 on the B2C side is always a little bit higher than others. It's seasonally high. Not materially, but seasonally high. And I would say, we're starting to see some of the deals we signed earlier ongoing online a little bit heavier, and that's why there was a nice quarter-over-quarter step-up. We would expect the numbers to continue to grow but maybe not on the same step function we saw quarter 1 to quarter 2, but we still see the back half of the year being stronger than the front half of the year.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Galinko from Sidoti.
Matthew Galinko: So appreciate you breaking out TONBELLER growth rate. Just curious how sustainable that is as we move forward?
Mike Pung: Yes, the -- year-to-date, our TONBELLER product is up about 30%. Remember, this was about a $20 million product line, overall. So it's a high percentage on a lower dollar amount. The TONBELLER team are continuing to sell a lot of, I'll call them, legacy deals that they were selling prior to the acquisition. Since the acquisition, we've signed a couple of very large deals that were probably out of the reach of them as a standalone company, and we're working on several others. The deals are more ratable revenue-oriented. They're not big upfront license sales like you typically see in some of our other lines of business. And so we're just kind of grinding away and trying to build a bigger book of business with the AML software we bought. And so far, we're happy with where we're headed.
Matthew Galinko: Got it. And then maybe just a follow-up on your large telco wins from last year. I'm wondering if you're finding that to be repeatable or is that go-live is having any influence on other deals in the pipeline that might be with other telcos?
Will Lansing: I think it is repeatable. The time line for that is uncertain. So there's -- obviously, the experience we're having with that large one is letting us kind of harden the product and understand scalability challenges and so on. The appetite in the marketplace is there, and so we work on it and it's anybody's guess as to when we'll see more in that vertical. But I think it is likely in our future.
Operator: And I'm not showing any questions in queue at this time.
Steven Weber: Thanks, operator. This concludes our call today. Thank you all for joining, and have a good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all have a great day.

===== 2017 Q1  (2017-01-31 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Steven P. Weber - Fair Isaac Corp. William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp. Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.
Analysts: Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc. William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Matthew E. Galinko - Sidoti & Co. LLC Blake Anderson - Stephens, Inc. Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Sarah, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fair Isaac Corporation Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. Steve Weber, you may begin your conference.
Steven P. Weber - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thank you, Sarah. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining FICO's first quarter earnings call. I'm Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike Pung. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate an understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular, in the Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website, or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and the Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through January 31, 2018. With that, I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thank you, Steve, and thank you everyone for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. I'm pleased to say, we're off to a good start, delivering solid growth across our portfolio. In our first quarter, we reported revenues of $220 million, an increase of 10% over the same period last year. We delivered $38 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $1.16 per share. Our GAAP earnings and EPS were positively affected by the adoption of a new accounting standard, which Mike will detail. Adjusting for that impact, GAAP net income and EPS were both up 7% from last year. We delivered $33 million of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS of $1.03 per share, both up 4% from the same period last year. I'm pleased that we're delivering growth throughout our business both our Scores and Decision Management Software segments were up 6% over the same period last year and Application segment was up 12% over the same period last year. We're continuing to see positive signs in our cloud business, where revenues were up 14% and bookings were up 48% versus last year. In fact, it was the second largest quarter ever for our cloud business and the pipeline for our solutions remains strong. As we sign more deals and grow our customer base, we are building a strong transactional revenue stream with recurring predictable revenues. We are seeing more evidence every quarter for increased market acceptance of our Decision Management Software. Bookings this quarter were up 31% over last year and represented the largest quarter ever in that segment. The investments we have made in distribution over the last year are beginning to pay off and we expect solid growth in this space moving forward. In the Scores business, we continue to make great strides towards maximizing the value of this cornerstone franchise. It's been two years since we announced the deal with Experian to add FICO Scores to their premium consumer offerings. The first year of that partnership was dedicated to rolling out Scores across the Experian platform. We continued last year to fine tune the program and pursue other opportunities with Experian. That led to an agreement we signed this month to further expand our relationship. This new agreement broadens the content we provide to Experian's premium consumer offerings. It also includes licensing the FICO Score as a key component in Experian's direct lead generation business. We believe in the value that this lead gen business can create for consumers and lenders by taking the friction out of the process. By including FICO Scores, the scores that are used by lenders to originate new loans, this lead gen business can instantly match consumers with the best pre-qualified offers. Furthermore, offering FICO Scores can produce higher response rates, better conversion rates and increased consumer satisfaction. We're excited about the possibilities of this expanded partnership and we're also pursuing several other meaningful opportunities in the Score space. In partnership with Experian, we're offering consumers world-class financial products in both the lead gen channel and the premium channel. On the B2B side, we're continuing to see positive results. Originations continue to be strong and we're seeing account growth in account management scores as well. In a rising rate environment, it's important to remember that our biggest point of leverage on the B2B side is in credit cards, which drives nearly two-thirds of our B2B scores revenue. Unlike other market participants, we price mortgage scores at the same rate as other credit card scores. Because of this, our exposure to mortgage is roughly only 10% of B2B scores revenue. So we're less affected by mortgage market headwinds. With the current momentum as well as visibilities into new revenue sources, we expect Scores growth to accelerate in the second half of the year. I'll share some summary thoughts later. But now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mike for further financial details.
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thanks Will. Good afternoon everyone. Today, I'll emphasize three points in my comments. First, we delivered $220 million of revenue, an increase of $20 million or 10% year-over-year. Cloud revenue was $50 million, up 14% from last year. Second, we delivered $38 million of GAAP net income, which included the impact of adopting ASU 2016-09, the new accounting standard related to share-based compensation. Finally, we had $28 million of free cash flow this quarter, and we used $30 million to repurchase shares. I'll begin by breaking the revenue down into our three reporting segments. Starting with Applications, revenues were $135 million, up 12% versus the same period last year. We also had a strong quarter in fraud solutions, originations in our Customer Communication Services product lines. Our Application bookings of $62 million represented an increase of 11% from the prior year. In the Decision Management Software segment, revenues were $26 million, up 6% versus the prior year. The increase this quarter was driven by services revenues in Xpress Optimization. Bookings were again strong in this segment at $26 million, representing a 31% increase over the same period last year. As Will said, it was the largest bookings quarter ever in this segment. Finally in our Scores segment, revenues were $59 million, up 6% from the same period last year. On the B2B side, we're up 8% versus the same period a year ago, and are continuing to see some positive trends. The B2C revenues were up a modest 3% from the same quarter last year, but we expect that to accelerate in the back half of the year as the new opportunities Will discussed go online. Looking at revenue by region. This quarter 77% of total revenues were derived from the Americas. Our EMEA region generated 16%, and the remaining 7% was from Asia-Pacific. Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter, represented 70% of total revenue. Consulting and implementation revenues were 20% of total, and license revenues were 10% of total revenue. Bookings this quarter were $96 million, up 12% from the prior year quarter. We generated $21 million of current period revenues on those bookings for a yield of about 21%. The weighted average term for our bookings was 27 months this quarter. We continue to book more large deals. This quarter we had 13 deals over $1 million versus 10 in the same period last year, and we booked 7 deals over $3 million compared to a total of 10 all of last year. We continue to drive strong bookings growth in our cloud-based products and built more backlog this quarter as our transactional bookings were up 21% over last year. Operating expenses totaled $185 million this quarter compared to $191 million in the fourth quarter. The investments we are making in delivery, support and infrastructure are proceeding as we discussed on our last call. As you can see in our Reg G schedule, our non-GAAP operating margin was 24% for the first quarter, we expect that operating margin to be between 26% to 28% for the full year. GAAP net income this quarter was $38 million and included a reduction to income tax expense of $17 million or $0.53 per share associated with the adoption of the Accounting Standard Update 2016-09. Non-GAAP net income was $33 million for the quarter up 4% from the same quarter last year. Under the new accounting standard excess tax benefits or deficiencies generated upon the settlement or exercise of stock awards are no longer recognized as additional paid in capital, but instead recognized as a reduction or increase to income tax expense. Estimating this item is difficult because it's dependent upon our future stock price in relation to the fair value of our awards. However, the largest impact typically happens in our first fiscal quarter because our annual grant vests in December. We expect the quarterly impact going forward to be much smaller over the remainder of the year. As a result of this change, the effective tax rate was negative 32% this quarter. We expect the unaffected or normalized tax rate to be about 29% to 30% for the full year before any impact of the accounting standard. The free cash flow for the quarter was $28 million, which included the impact of the new accounting standard. On a comparable basis, free cash flow was $46 million in the prior year. For the trailing 12 months, reflecting this impact, free cash flow was $168 million. Turning to the balance sheet, we had $88 million of cash on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. Our total debt is $621 million with a weighted average interest rate of 4.1% and our ratio of total net debt to adjusted EBITDA this quarter is 2.3 times, well below the covenant level of 3 times. During the quarter, we returned $30 million in excess cash to our investors, repurchasing 258,000 shares at an average price of $117.91. We repurchased another 158,000 shares in January at an average price of $122.90. We have about 180 million remaining on the latest board authorization and continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of our cash. We also continue to actively evaluate opportunities to acquire technologies and products that advance our strategy and strengthen our portfolio and competitive position. Finally, we are updating our previously provided guidance to adjust for the first quarter impact of this new accounting standard. We are not including any impact in the future quarters until they are known. We are now guiding for the full fiscal year as follows: Revenues remain unchanged at approximately $925 million; GAAP net income previously guided at $109 million is now adjusted by this quarter's excess tax benefit of $17 million to a new total of approximately $126 million. GAAP earnings per share is now approximately $3.92, non-GAAP net income remains unchanged at $158 million and non-GAAP EPS is also unchanged at $4.92 per share. With that, I'll turn it back over to Will for a final comment.
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thanks, Mike. As I said in my opening remarks, I believe we are well-positioned for success as we move into 2017 and beyond. Our Scores business has never been stronger, and is now beginning to build market share on the consumer side to match the dominance we have had for decades among financial institutions. And now, we're beginning to see the tangible impact of the investments we made in our Software business. We developed products; we've invested in sales resources. Now we're producing higher bookings and building a backlog of recurring transactional revenue. We're still working in getting our distribution up to speed, as we train and deploy newly hired sales resources but we're gaining momentum and we're confident we're on the right track. I'll turn the call back now to Steve for Q&A.
Steven P. Weber - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks and we're ready now to take your questions. Sarah, please open the line.
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is open.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Good evening gentlemen. The first question I had was in terms of your expanded agreements with Experian and your commentary on B2C growth should accelerate because of that, could you help us maybe just understand the, I guess, the change in the scope of that agreement? I know you said, I guess it was mainly lead gen and does that include the Discover, I guess, work that you're doing with those guys?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: There is really two pieces to the expansion. One piece has to do with a broader use of FICO Scores with Experian's paid products. And as you know, there is more than one FICO Score and most of the Experian premium products were wrapped around using a single FICO Score as opposed to a broader set of scores. And the new agreement contemplates the broader use of FICO Scores so that consumers can get effectively a dashboard of multiple FICO Scores and have a more comprehensive view of their credit position. So that's one part of it. And we've given Experian a great deal flexibility to construct the products in the way that they see is most valuable to consumers and so it's an expanded flexibility that we have tried to drive here so that the consumer winds up with a better offering, Experian gets better offering and we obviously benefit for that. The second part of it has to do with the lead gen piece and that's a business that we have contemplated for several years now as we've watched other players in the space build lead gen programs. We have always believed that FICO participation in a lead gen program would be more valuable to the lenders than the offerings by these other players because there is a lot less breakage and friction in going from a FICO Score for a prospect to an offer of credit. And so working together with Experian, we're now prepared to offer a lead gen offering to the market that uses a FICO Score as opposed to so-called education scores. So that's really the second part of it.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And does that include the Experian Discover partnership or is that separate?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: That's separate.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. So it's an expanded Experian and then the Discover work you do. Okay. And then I don't know maybe I'm reading too much, but your commentary on evaluating M&A options, the technology and so forth, is that just standard commentary or is there something in the pipeline that we should be looking out for?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: That is our standard commentary. So we continue to love buying back our own stock and we set a very high bar for M&A activity. And at the same time, we're always on the prowl, always looking for opportunities, but as you know and as we've said many times, the alternatives to investing in our own business are obviously being held to a pretty high standard because we're so happy with our own prospects.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. And then just last question from me, any initial read-throughs or comments that are coming from your customers on the impacts from the new administration that you would want to point out?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: No, I think it is a little early to say. But the obvious elements have to do with if there's a reform in regulation that eases the burden on our bank customers, they're likely to benefit from that and if they do, we will.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. All right. Thanks a lot guys.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good evening everyone.
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Hi, Bill.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So congratulations on a strong quarter and especially on the strong bookings. So I wanted to start out by asking about what's new on the affinity side? That's an opportunity that you guys have talked about in the past and see if we could get an update there.
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Yeah, Bill, we are obviously in discussions with others about doing additional affinity programs and work. Those discussions are underway. We're not in a position to announce anything yet. But I think that announcements are coming soon. We feel pretty good about our prospects in the affinity space. And I guess, connected with that, a little bit different from affinity, but related is our activity in the paid education space where we have been exploring paid programs that go well beyond the free open access program and some of those are imminent as well.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So this is – I've heard this referred to as Open Access Plus, sort of a hybrid between the traditional credit monitoring and the Open Access program. Is that the way to think of that?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: I think that's a way to think about it. I think we're careful to distinguish between two only because Open Access is a completely free program designed to let the consumer benefit from a score that the bank is already purchasing. And so this program, it does go above and beyond Open Access, but we don't call it an open access program because it's not a free program. It's a paid program. It's paid by the bank, not by the consumer, but is still a paid program.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So Discover had made some interesting comments on their call last week. It sounded like they're planning to increase their marketing investment to support an acceleration in the credit card loan growth from, looks like they did about 4.7% growth in 2016 and they're talking about talking it up 5.5% to 7.5% in 2017. The other comment they made was that about 75% of that loan growth is coming from newer card members. So I wanted to ask how that was going insofar as you could talk about it and then also ask whether you're in active dialogue with other issuers to replicate that type of an offering?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: So we can't really comment on Discover except to say that we have a program with them today that we're very happy with and we continue to work on expanding it. Don't have anything to announce today, but we're obviously always looking to expand and broaden our partnership with them. And do we have similar kinds of things in discussion with other players? Yes, we do.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yeah. And then separately with Experian's right offer, you had mentioned that goal of better matching consumers with a prequalified credit offer with the thought that that will produce a better response rate and better conversion rate for the lenders. I guess, my question is how is that going? Is the goal of the program actually being met? Is it actually resulting in better conversion? And then how many lenders are working with it, and what kind of a revenue model is it using because it sounds like it is a different model than the traditional per subscriber per month basis.
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Okay. So it's early days to provide data. So, our views about the lower breakage for lenders and the higher utility for consumers that comes out using a FICO Score versus non-FICO Score, we don't have data to present. It's more kind of a logic thing where we just believe that if you give a consumer a real FICO Score and that's the basis for making the decision once the credit offer is made, there is going to be less breakage. That seems like kind of basic. But we don't have data to share there yet. And then with respect to the revenue model, it is a rev share kind of an arrangement. I can't go into a lot of detail on it. But basically, we have completely aligned interest with Experian on this and it's a rev share model.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. And then a question on DMS Telco deal that you guys had announced this past May, I think that had plan to go live in November and I wanted to ask how that have performed during the peak holiday season? And then also ask about the next piece of that implementation on the marketing piece how that was looking? And then ultimately, how we should think about modeling the revenue for that?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Well, so just to take those questions in order, we have gone live. We've gone live without a hitch. We ran smoothly right through the holidays without any kind of outages or failures. Although, I'll say that we were tested. I mean, that's natural, and, this represents a pretty big volume and a big infrastructure play for us. And so we had a lot of work to do to make sure that we're up to snuff. But we sailed through it and we're happy with the results. Too early to talk about the marketing, but we're feeling pretty good about the way that entire operation have gone.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. And then one housekeeping question. Just on the B2C growth, how was the growth within the myFICO piece of that?
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: So this quarter, Bill, year-over-year, we had 3% growth across all of B2C, and myFICO was about mid-single digits and all the rest collectively was a little bit shy of that.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Galinko from Sidoti. Your line is open.
Matthew E. Galinko - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Hey, good afternoon, guys. You called out strength in Customer Communications. Curious, was there just a single large deal that was pushing on that, or did you have number of deals, and, just generally what's your, I guess, outlook for that product?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: It's across the board. It's not a single deal. That's ratable revenue and so it kind of marches upwards smoothly, at least we hope it does and it is now. That's been a multi-year journey for us, getting all of the offering on to a single code base, getting the infrastructure in place globally so we can support customers around the globe, leveraging AWS to get to places that we don't have operations. So it's been a journey. Right now we feel like we're hitting our stride. We think we have the best offering in the market by a fairly right margin. Customers seem to believe that too. And so, it's gone very smoothly. But it's not one single thing, it's kind of everything working together, good execution across the board.
Matthew E. Galinko - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Got it. And if I'm not mistaken, did you acquire that asset?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: We did. It was...
Matthew E. Galinko - Sidoti & Co. LLC: So I think you had about 20%
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: I am sorry, go ahead.
Matthew E. Galinko - Sidoti & Co. LLC: I was going to say I think you had, when you made the acquisition, it was somewhere around low double digit growth rate, maybe around 15% to 20%. And, you talked a little bit about the size of the market for you there. But can you talk a little bit about I know you said you're hitting your stride. Is there a substantial addressable market ahead of you on that and do you see that as being a product that can drive, your Software business over the next couple of years?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Yeah, good question. Okay, so just a bit of history. The company was called Adeptra. We bought it a bit over four years ago. It was a good growing company when we bought it. It had reached some scale limits on the infrastructure on which it was operated. I would say that we spent several years in a retrenchment mode and I don't think it's just kind of post-merger integration blues. I think we really had a lot of rework to do on the code base and on the infrastructure. And so we really didn't have tremendous growth for several years in the middle. I feel like we're back onto a double digit growing kind of trajectory. Where is the growth coming from? It's multiple areas. There is the growth that comes out of appending Customer Communication Services to our existing franchises. So that takes primarily two forms, one is fraud, where we have a very strong franchise and now we have an opportunity to talk directly to our customers' customers about fraud alerts and is that really you and did you make this transaction, and those kinds of things. And then a second franchise where we have natural extension and have a lot of volume is in collections and recovery where our Debt Manager 9 products offering is naturally complimented by an ability to talk directly to our customers' customer. And, of course, there is a feedback loop there that improves the efficacy, improves the outcome. So those are kind of the more natural things for us where we build and extend from businesses we're already in. It does have the potential to open up doors in new areas like marketing and particularly since we now have this DMS platform that allows our customers to use the same data from multiple data feeds but the same data to inform different kinds of activities, whether its origination or line management, or marketing solutions or customer communications, we now can append this Customer Communication Service to many other things. So we anticipate the demand it will grow beyond even the two franchises were strong right now.
Matthew E. Galinko - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks. And maybe a left field kind of question here, but insofar as you have a lot of products that you're I think to some degree experimenting with or testing, that aren't necessarily core at this point, but if you find kind of a non-core product that you think you could better monetize through divesting the product line, I mean, do you think about that at all? Or do you still feel that everything you have today is better taken to market under the FICO umbrella?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Well that's a great question Matthew. I mean, we have a fairly disciplined process here. We've adopted GE's S1-S2 strategy process where we review all of our businesses twice a year, kind of mid-year with a look to what the three year outlook looks like, and we look at the competitive environment and the market and total addressable market, and what the headwinds are, how strong our product is, and what its prospects looked like. And we then we come back towards the end of the year, where we tighten down and lock up the budget for the subsequent year, and that's the S2 part of the S1-S2 process and in that we kind of have the buttoned up tactical next year plan. In the course of that strategy work, we always evaluate whether it makes sense for us to continue to be in the business, whether the business would be more valuable in someone else's hands, and whether we're adequately resourcing some of our young not yet big and widely profitable businesses. And of course, that's a challenge for a company like ours because we have prospects that are really tremendous, far more than we can effectively resource. I think we recognize that we have this kind of feast of riches in analytics and we can't participate in all the great opportunities we have around us. I would say that the businesses that we're in, we have the half dozen or so core franchises where we're typically number one or number two in the business and if we're not number one or number two, we believe we have the industry leading product. And there is only a couple of exceptions to that in our portfolio and where there is an exception, we're usually in it for a different reason or because we believe that there is an opportunity for us to improve it. And so I would say that that's a long way of saying that we're pretty happy with the portfolio. There is nothing in the portfolio today that we're prepared to divest or that we're seriously contemplating divesting. There are some growth opportunities that have to be managed carefully because we can't do everything we'd like to do and so we have to pick our winners. For example, we're putting a lot of investment into cyber right now. That's a money losing business for FICO because we're pouring in resources and the revenue is not there yet. We have every expectation that that's going to be a great business in several years. And so we are resourcing it appropriately. But of course that's going to crowd out some other opportunities and that's what it is doing and those are the hard decisions we have to make.
Matthew E. Galinko - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Got it. I appreciate that color and congrats on the quarter.
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Huff from Stephens. Your line is open.
Blake Anderson - Stephens, Inc.: Hey, guys, congrats on a nice quarter. This is Blake Anderson on for Brett. In Applications, I know you briefly touched on your customer communications, but can you size the license sales in Fraud Management Solutions? Was there anything, any outsized deals in fraud for to you call out?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Just one. We had a scheduled license renewal in fraud that hit this quarter. The scheduled renewal was quarter two and it got signed by end of December at the request of the customer. Beyond that it was kind of routine business in the numbers.
Blake Anderson - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And then your gross margins were down just a little bit year-over-year. Anything to call out there that was driving that?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Not really. The mix of the margin is often dependent upon the mix of how much ratable and services business we have in comparison to license revenue and scores revenue, the latter being higher margin, the former being lower margin, and we had a higher mix of services revenue because of some of the deals we booked last year. Beyond that nothing.
Blake Anderson - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. And then for the margin guidance for the year, are you still attributing that range primarily to your investments and delivering cloud infrastructure, or is there anything that's kind of popped up in the 1Q that might be driving that that we should pay attention to more throughout the rest of the year?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: No, nothing changed from what we said in November when we set the guidance. It really is tied to two things. It's tied to the additional investments we built into our budget that we're making with respect to our infrastructure and our cloud. That's number one. And, number two, it's tied to the ultimate mix of business we have between lower margin ratable and services business compared to the higher margin license and scores. And thus the 300 basis point range. But nothing has changed from November.
Blake Anderson - Stephens, Inc.: All right. And then lastly, how does paying down debt kind of stack up in your uses of cash priorities? I know you said share repo, is number one. I know you mentioned the comments on M&A. But how do you guys think about paying down debt?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Well, so the current debt we have, the blend is at about 4.1%. So it's pretty cheap debt. More than half of it is in a revolver, which is under 200 basis points. And I guess, we could pay that down, but we think we have a better use of cash than paying down 2% debt. On the other hand, the rest of it is in term notes that have scheduled maturities and if we pay those off early we have a penalty, a make whole penalty and as a result we have just simply let the maturities happen and we rolled them into the revolver. So at least under the current kind of regulatory environment and tax environment, what we have been doing is what we will continue to do until we reach a point where we think it's sensible to refinance the entire debt structure and we're a little a ways away from that, probably a year away from that.
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: We don't really think about it as a paying off debt. I mean, we like our leverage where it is in this 2 times to 2.5 times area. And so to the extent that we have maturities, we replace it with lower cost revolving debt. And at some point we could reevaluate that equation. But I wouldn't expect a very big difference in our leverage position going forward.
Blake Anderson - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Klauber from William Blair. Your line is open.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi, good afternoon, and thanks. When we look at the bookings, could you give us a rough idea on the Decision Management? How many of those came from sort of the existing core of financials versus newer verticals?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Yeah. I don't have the exact numbers, Adam. It's probably this quarter more slightly weighed towards financial services than it is outside of financial services. So of our total bookings, I can tell you 60%, 68%, 69% were with our kind of core financial services business. The remainder was outside. As it relates to DMS, I just don't know that level of detail offhand.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Sure.
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: It's probably similar.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. Then just following up on the margin. You know, just on an absolute basis, as you mentioned you've been investing in sales and delivery and expenses are up compared to year ago, but its looks like they're flattening out. So is that a way for us to think about it? Are they at a better run rate today compared to a year ago but you won't see big jumps up over the rest of the year?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Yeah. Our current run rates are around $185 million plus or minus.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah.
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: You usually see a little bit of uptick in our second quarter, the one we're in right now, simply because our annual salary increase happens in December and so you see the first full impact of 2% to 3% salary increase in our fiscal second quarter. And then oddly enough, you see a payroll tax reset. Most people have hit their payroll tax maximum by the end of the year and it gets reset January 1. So we see actually $2 million, $3 million increase in that. So that kind of will put the number up a little bit higher than $185 million. But we're kind of locked in, in this range, and are kind of managing our business at that level as we pursue a more top-line growth.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. And that sounds like more normalized growth going forward then sort of jumps we've seen over the last couple of quarters then?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Yeah.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Okay. Then as far as the Experian, obviously a great sign. Is that a couple of quarters that we'll see some of the impacts from those new agreements or can we see that more near term?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: I think a couple quarters is pretty near term, but I think you'll see it grow throughout the year. It's going to start smaller and ramp up.
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: And remember it's kind of tied to Experian's marketing budgets and marketing plans which are outside of our area of control. And so it can vary, the speed and pace at which the, basically tied to their new fiscal year coming up here in April.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Right. Right. Okay. And then as far as cyber you mentioned and obviously that's a long-term effort and it's still very, very early. Any chance we'll see even a little revenue this year or is that probably more of an 2018 type occurrence?
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: It's really more than 2018 occurrence, although little bit of revenue trickling in. There is a lot of interest. There is a lot of interest. There are lot of conversations going on. We've got a little bit of business going. We've got business going with our iboss partnership. So things are coming along, but it's way premature to expect any kind of revenue in 2017. Could it be meaningful in 2018? It will be visible. It will be visible in 2018 and meaningful in 2019.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, great. That's great to hear. Thanks, guys.
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thanks, Adam.
Operator: And there are no further questions in the queue at this time. I will now turn the call back over to the presenters.
Steven P. Weber - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thank you. This concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Amanda and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Fair Isaac Corporation Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Steve Weber. Please go ahead.
Steven P. Weber - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thank you, Amanda. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining FICO's fourth quarter earnings call. I'm Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike Pung. Today, we issued a press release that describes our financial results compared to the prior-year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular, in the Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website, or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and the Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through November 07 of 2017. And now, I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. I'll summarize our financial results for the quarter and full fiscal year. And then take a step back and talk about the progress we made this fiscal year on our growth initiatives. And finally, I'll discuss how these initiatives have us poised for growth in 2017 and beyond. In our fourth quarter, we reported revenues of $236 million, an increase of 1% over the same period last year. We delivered $32 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $1 per share, which included a favorable tax adjustment that Mike will walk through. We delivered $41 million of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS of $1.28 per share. It's a great finish to an outstanding fiscal year. Our full-year revenue growth of 5% beat our guidance and even adjusting for the tax benefit we still beat our guided net income and EPS. On the software side, our Applications business was up 1% for the full-year over last year and our Decision Management Software business, which we historically called Tools was up 2%. I'm pleased we were able to show growth at the time when we're shifting to radical cloud based revenues. The real growth story in our software is our bookings, which grew 23% from last year for these segments. In cloud revenues which increased 14% in fiscal 2016 and an indication of we're building more and more committed backlog for the coming periods. Our Scores business was up 9% this quarter versus the prior-year quarter and 16% for the full-year versus the prior-year. Consumer revenues were up 27% for the full-year and B2B was up 12%. It was a very good year for us and I am happy with the progress we're making in a number of areas. In our Scores segment, we continue to expand our industry leading business-to-business FICO Scores into the larger faster growing U.S. consumer market. The FICO Score Open Access program continued its expansion during the current year. Through this program we now have more than 180 million consumer accounts with access to their free FICO Score. The partnership agreement we launched in fiscal 2015 with Experian continued to accelerate during the current year. And we are looking at ways to expand that partnership. We also announced partnership with Progrexion and the non-bank affinity deal, which we expect a ramp throughout 2017. And we are in discussions with additional partners to further expand the FICO Score sold directly to consumer. We also introduced a lead generation program used by financial institutions and credit card lenders to identify new customers. On the software side, we've made and continue to make significant investments in innovation. We've invested in growth initiatives that expand our addressable markets. We've taken our core IP coupled with the QuadMetrics acquisition to bring cyber analytics solutions to market. We expanded our traditional on-premise software into cloud-based solutions in our Applications and Decision Management segments to provide growth opportunities with customers that can benefit from the affordability and simplicity of these solutions. Our software solutions are now available through our private cloud, the FICO Analytic Cloud, and we are adding delivery of our solutions through large vendors like AWS and geographic locations across the world. And this year, we introduced the FICO Decision Management Suite 2.0, which provides an easy way for customers to evaluate, customize, deploy and scale state-of-the-art analytics. The Decision Management Suite allows customers to quickly integrate our tools and components with their data, helping organizations of all sizes, realize the promise of Advanced Analytics and Decision Management in a cost-effective scalable cloud or on-premise solution. These have been important strategic investments, and we're now beginning to see the signs of the path. In fact, I believe the second half of 2016 was an inflection point for our Decision Management Suite and for FICO as a whole. We're seeing signs of it in our revenues as we continue to build recurring cloud revenue streams and committed backlog. And we're seeing it in our bookings, where our recurring revenue bookings increased 38% in fiscal 2016 versus the prior-year. Most importantly, we're seeing it in the discussions we're having with our customers and prospective customers. We're working closely with the broader group of industries than ever before. We continue to be a go-to-vendor for financial services, but more and more we're talking with a wide variety of industries and governmental entities to help them use data to make their most difficult decisions. As we look ahead to 2017, we will continue to invest in areas of our business where we see the greatest growth potential. Last year, I said we would concentrate on sales and distribution in 2016 and we've done that. We've increased our sales force by about 50 people and we grew our bookings in 2016 by 20% from the prior-year. Our current year cloud bookings doubled from last year, representing just over one-fourth of our total bookings. In addition, our cloud pipeline is healthy and growing fast. As a result of this growing demand, we're accelerating investments in our delivery support and infrastructure operations during 2017 to ensure successful deployment and improved customer experience with our solutions. We remain focused on balancing prudent investment with the return to our shareholders expect from us. And we're very thoughtful in how we deploy our strong cash flow. In 2016, we paid down some debt, as some of our (7:21) matured. And of course, we remained committed to our stock repurchase program buying back 1.3 million shares in 2016. We are strong believers in our own prospects and we're investing in repurchases as an excellent use for the cash we generate. We are increasingly confident about our future. We still see occasional lumpiness due to uneven license sales, but that volatility gets muted as licenses become a smaller percentage of the overall revenue. It's also difficult to predict timing of many of our larger go-live dates or new partnerships, but we have more opportunities in more areas than we've ever had. I'll talk more about our outlook for 2017, but first I'll turn the call over to Mike for further financial details.
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll emphasize three points in my prepared comments. First, we delivered $236 million of revenue this quarter, up 1% over the same period last year and a total of $881 million for the year, up 5% from the prior-year. Full-year revenue derived from our cloud products were $192 million, up 14% from the prior-year. Second, we delivered $32 million in net income this quarter, which included a reduction to income tax expense of $3.3 million. Net income for the full-year was $109 million. Finally, we delivered $14 million of free cash flow in the quarter and $161 million for the fiscal year. We repurchased 1.3 million shares during the year or 4% of our outstanding shares. I'll begin by reviewing the results in each of our three reporting segments. Our Applications revenue were $149 million, up 5% from last quarter and flat versus the same period last year. Full-year revenues for Applications were $533 million, up 1% from last year. The increase in revenue was driven from our recurring businesses, primarily our originations management cloud solutions, customer communication services and compliance solutions, partially offset by higher term license revenue last year in our Fraud Solution. In our Decision Management Software segment, which we formally called Tools segment, revenues were $24 million, down 34% from last quarter and down 8% from the same period last year. In both cases, due to fewer upfront license deals. Full-year DMS revenues were $108 million, up 2% from last year, DMS bookings were $15 million this quarter and $70 million for the year. And finally in our Scores segment revenues were $63 million, up 3% from last quarter and 9% from the same period last year. B2B was up 13% over the same period last year, driven by strong consumer lending and B2C revenues were up 4% from the same period last year. For the full-year Scores revenues were $241 million, up 16% from last year. Looking at revenue by region. This quarter, 70% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region, our EMEA region generated 20% and the remaining 10% was from Asia Pacific. Recurring revenues which are derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter represented 65% of total revenues. Consulting and implementation revenues were 22% of total and license revenues were 13% of total revenue. For the full-year 69% of our revenues were recurring compared to 67% last year. We generated $16 million of current period revenue on bookings of $80 million, a 20% yield. The weighted average term for our bookings was 37 months this quarter. For the full-year, bookings were $378 million, up 20% from the prior-year, giving us good visibility into our revenue as we head into fiscal year 2017. Also let me provide some additional details around our cloud products, which include our CCS Solutions, our cloud enabled franchises such as Origination Manager, the Decision Management Platform, Debt Manager and our Legacy Custom Hosting Products. Cloud revenue totaled $192 million for the year versus $168 million last year, an increase of 14%. Bookings related to these products were $99 million compared to $45 million last year. We have customers in a variety of industries with the largest concentration in financial services, Telco and insurance. We've been pacing our investments as the business grows and plan to increase our infrastructure cost modestly in 2017 to stay ahead of the growing demand. Our operating expenses totaled $191 million this quarter, up $7 million from the prior quarter. The increase relates to performance-based incentives and some additional software development and professional services head count. As you can see in our Reg G schedule, non-GAAP operating margin was 26% for the quarter and 27% for the year. We expect that our operating margins will be between 26% to 28% in 2017. GAAP net income this quarter was $32 million, down 4% from the prior-year. We had a reduction to income tax expense of $3.3 million, or about $0.10 a share associated with one-time foreign tax credits. Our non-GAAP net income was $41 million for the quarter, down 19% from the same quarter last year. For the full-year, net income was $109 million, up 27% from the prior-year and non-GAAP net income was $155 million, up 15% compared to the prior-year. The effective tax rate for the full-year was 24%, below our previous guidance due to the foreign tax credit and other benefits derived from foreign entity restructuring. We expect the effective tax rate to be 29% to 30% for our full-year fiscal 2017. It's important to note, we're early adopting FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09 in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. This standard changes the accounting for share-based payments and our expected tax rate excludes the impact related to these changes. Under this pronouncement, excess tax benefits or deficiencies which were previously recorded as an adjustment to paid-in capital will now be reflected as reductions or increases to income tax expense. In fiscal 2016, we reflected an excess tax benefit of $25 million as a credit to paid-in capital, whereas under the new accounting; this amount would have been reflected as reduction to income tax expense. The free cash flow for the quarter was $14 million compared to $39 million in the same period last year. For the full-year, free cash flow was $161 million compared to $105 million in the prior-year. Turning to the balance sheet, we had $76 million in cash at the end of the quarter, down $42 million from last quarter, due to debt reduction in share repurchases, partially offset by cash generated from operations. Our total debt is now $571 million with the weighted average interest rate of 4.1%. The ratio of our total net debt to adjusted EBITDA is 2.2 times, below the covenant level of 3 times. We bought back 308,000 shares in the fourth quarter at an average price of $123.19. In fiscal 2016, we repurchased a total of 1.3 million shares at an average price of $103.65 for a total of $138 million. At the end of the quarter, we still had $230 million remaining on the latest board authorization, and continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. We also continue to actively evaluate opportunities to acquire relevant technologies and products that advance our strategy, our strength in our portfolio and a competitive position. With that, I'll turn it back over to Will for his thoughts on 2017.
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thanks Mike. As I said in my opening remarks, I believe we're well positioned for success as we move into 2017 and beyond. We continue to find new ways to leverage our Scores assets and have significant opportunities to further expand usage of the industry-standard FICO Score among consumers. Our investments in software innovation, our Decision Management Suite is showing signs of market acceptance and early signs of corresponding revenue growth. And our Applications for years available is on-premise solutions had been refreshed and are expanding into new markets as cloud-based solutions. We have focused and invested in innovation. And as I've said in the past, I'm confident that we have multiple paths to growth in our future. As we signed larger deals, it's difficult to know the exact timing of the launch, but we are committed to putting resources behind the implementations to get them live and producing recurring revenue. With all this in mind, we're providing the following guidance for fiscal 2017. We are guiding revenues of approximately $925 million, an increase of about 5% versus fiscal 2016. We are guiding GAAP net income of approximately $109 million flat with 2016 due to the impact of the lower tax expense in 2016. GAAP earnings per share of approximately $3.39, net GAAP net income of $158 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.92. The EPS guidance excludes the impact of ASU 2016-09 and assumes current share counts; although as Mike said, we continue to view repurchases as an attractive use of our cash. I'll now turn the call back to Steve to handle the Q&A.
Steven P. Weber - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks and we will now take your questions. Amanda, please open the lines.
Operator: And your first question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Good evening, gentlemen. First question is just on the Tools or now DMS business. The first, I think just to clarify, I think you guys had called out high single-digit growth for the end of the year, it sounded like you said a lot of the stuff might have got pushed out, was the underperformance this quarter just purely because of timing around there, just some color if you could add there? And then just to clarify, the renaming of Tools to DMS. Is that just a rename or are you going to move some numbers out of Tools into Apps or something and this is purely a DMS sale number now?
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: Hi, Manav, it's Mike. The DMS is just purely a renaming. There's no change in any other way any of our products are being rolled up between our DMS and our Applications business. As it relates to the revenue for DMS, you are right, we were calling high single-digit. We came in low single-digit for the year and it's a combination of deals that we signed that are ratable and a combination of the timing of license – upfront license revenues. The amount of bookings, the amount of backlog continues to be really strong in the health of the business is strong as well.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And just some – maybe just some logic again just on the Tools to DMS, because isn't there more than just DMS in there or are you guys selling it differently now?
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: No, there's no change. We're rebranding the segment to be called Decision Management Software. The Decision Management Software includes what was previously called our Component Tools, but it also includes a lot of the products that we've been talking about that we've added to this table of products in the segment. And so, we felt it was just a better way to describe the work in process of building out the product suite into something much more broader than just a simple toolset.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then just on the – again on the margin commentary or the guidance of 26% to 28%, you ended this year 27%, it's a wide range, and I think at least the assumption was – Will, I think you talked about 2017 being the inflection point, and we thought obviously margins would be high, so what are the variables that have you at such a high range in that margin guidance?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Great question. It really has everything to do with the amount of investment we put against cloud infrastructure to support more and more cloud deals. So, you can see that the ramp in our cloud deals is climbing, and frankly, climbing even a little faster than we expected. And as a result, we find ourselves in a situation where we want to really get ahead of the curve in terms of having cloud infrastructure to support these new cloud customers as they come on. Frankly, it is a bottleneck and a constraint for us today. We could do more than we're doing because we have some capacity constraints. So we're making the investments to make sure that we have all the infrastructure we need to support these new deals. And the range has to do with how fast we have to do it. So, we have – what we think is a pretty realistic estimate of the investment we need to make for next year, and it could go up or down from the estimate based on really how quickly the business comes in.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And how about just comments around the investments you are making in the sales force and maybe R&D like are those going to step up as well this year?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Well, R&D remains roughly the same. We remain committed to refreshing and continuing to expand the innovation in our product, and so that's not going to stop. But I don't think you will see as a percentage, it's not going to grow either. And then on the sales side, we did step up in sales last year, and we did spend more there, and we wound up with more coverage than we've had in the past. I mentioned that we'd added 50 heads and not that we're going to stop. That's a work in progress, and we continue to add and lose people as is natural. But I think that in terms of where is the most investment going on a relative basis, the most investments is going into delivery and into cloud infrastructure.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. I appreciate that. I'll get back in the queue.
Operator: And your next question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good evening everyone, and congratulations on a strong quarter.
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thanks, Bill.
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Thanks.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So I wanted to ask about the Discover deal. Just in watching some of the World Series notice some ads for the Discover product, the Scorecard and wanted to ask how that relationship was going. I figured if, Discover was out there aggressively promoting it on a major sporting event that you guys had reached agreement in terms of the revenue model and just wanted to get some further thoughts there?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Well, I would say, we're delighted with our partnership with Discover. And the fact that they're doing the promotion that they are doing ought to give you some sense for how satisfied they are with the initiative. Clearly, this notion of using FICO Scores with non-customers with potential customers' prospects, the idea of using FICO Scores to win fresh business for the banks is a big idea. And traditionally historically, we've had FICO Scores using the credit decisions on the B2B side. We have FICO Scores in the paid business as in our Experian partnership. We just started to toe in the water with the affinity business, affinity paid business. We have FICO Scores and Open Access, which is not a big revenue item, but it really cements our positioning with the consumer. And the one big gap really has been using FICO Scores with prospects. And so the idea of doing that is a big idea. Discover is first in this. They are partnering it and it's going really well.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Now as you mentioned Discover is an early adopter, they were an early adopter of Open Access as well. Are you talking with other banks?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: We are talking with other banks; yes. And I think you can expect that this program will expand through 2017 and beyond. The alternative that the banks have is to get leads from other lead providers who don't use FICO Scores. And as a result, there is breakage in the model where they get into score, that turns out to not to be the score that the big bank uses for making its credit decision. So obviously, there is a big benefit to using the same score in the customer acquisition than used (25:32) for making the credit decision. It enables you to make an offer of credit with a lot more confidence. Beyond that the FICO Score has such a strong brand identity that's actually a nice – it's a nice tool for customer acquisition that brings in the traffic, brings in the volume in a way that a non-FICO Score does not. So, we anticipate tremendous interest from other banks as we go forward.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: One of your wins last year had been a large Telecom client for Decision Management Suite. You had been doing implementation for that, has that DMS client gone live now? Is that actually generating the main piece of the revenue the $10 million to $12 million per year?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Yes, I'm happy to report that it has gone live. It's gone live smoothly. We have a happy customer and we have a lot of people who are working around the clock to make sure that it continues to run smoothly. But it is – the early returns are really excellent. We're really excited about the way it's gone. And in terms of the revenue that builds over time, most of it's transaction-based.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. A couple housekeeping question just on the Scores business, very strong growth there. On the B2C side, in the past, you've talked about the – how the myFICO piece has done versus the rest of the B2C business. I was hoping if we could get that detail?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Yeah. We'll give you that detail in a second. I would say that the thing to keep in mind with myFICO, myFICO is doing great. So let me start with that. We're really proud of what we have there and we have it positioned as really as the premium offering in the marketplace. That said, we will never be able to put the marketing muscle behind myFICO that our partners can put behind leveraging FICO for their brands. And so, we wind up living with a certain amount of cannibalization of the myFICO business, because we work so closely with partners like Experian.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yeah.
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: So, obviously that would be – the headwind is the cannibalization that we've created for ourselves and notwithstanding that we continue to be very successful with it and it winds up being kind of the industry-leading offering. And also a little bit of a lab for testing out new ideas, which we then share with our partners and encourage them to adopt. So, that's the broad picture. Let me give you a little bit of detail, do you have that handy?
Michael J. Pung - Fair Isaac Corp.: Yeah. For the quarter Bill, year-over-year, the myFICO part grew about mid single-digit and the rest of it was low single-digit growth year-over-year.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. Excellent. Well, thank you very much. I'll get back in the queue.
Operator: Your next question comes from Matthew Galinko from Sidoti.
Matthew Galinko - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Hey, good afternoon guys. Will, you talked about hitting an inflection point in the DMS business in the second half of this year. So, I was hoping you could maybe drill a little bit more on to that of what you think has changed, is it just the product readiness or just a combination of that and the reps you're putting in place or just market acceptance, in general, just what's changed?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: You know, I think it's all the above. It's not one single thing, but what we have is, (29:12). The product is more mature. It's very usable. The product is not a product as such, it's a set of capabilities that underlies a lot of our Applications and Solutions. And so, what we're seeing is that, it gives us the ability to get up and running faster with the customer. It used to be that to install a big application on-premise could take 14 months, could take 16 months multiyear deal, big expensive complex; and while of course, we still have some deals that are structured that way because of their complexity, being able to do things with DMS is definitely (29:55) our implementation process. Such that, we're now doing very big deals in eight months and nine months and smaller deals we can get up in two months, three months, four months. So, I would say, speed to market, speed to go live, overall cost of implementation, market acceptance, all those kinds of things are what's in play here.
Matthew Galinko - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Got it. And then you mentioned the 50 sales reps, I assume quota carrying that you added this year and I guess can you just qualify if that was in line with what you are targeting? Are you satisfied with their performance as a whole and is there anything that you are tweaking along the way in terms of structure of comp or how you incentivize them that you were aim to get – to I guess optimize what you get out of your sales force?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: Yeah. Good question. Well, if you asked the CEO of Software company, how the sales force is doing? He'll answer, they can always do better. And that's the case today too. I would say that, we're happier and happier with the performance of our sales force. The number of heads it's 50 is right in line with what we were looking for. Would I be delighted to hire another 50 or 100 or 200? I would. The challenge is that until we get them productive it winds up being a cost item. And so, we kind of – we do it on a measured basis as we bring them in. We continue to refresh the sales force. There's a lot of focus on productivity these days. And bringing people up to speed and getting them the right training. Ours is not a simple sale. This is not software that comes in a suitcase. It's a technical sale, it requires domain expertise. And so, our sales people are really, really high quality domain and technical product experts. Those people are hard to come by and when we grow them on our own, which is a very successful strategy, it takes long time. But that's working very well for us. So, the long answer to your question is, we're happy with the progress we've made. We're not satisfied that we're done. We'll continue to work at it. And I expect that the sales force will get stronger, both in terms of coverage and in terms of technical depth and quality.
Matthew Galinko - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Got it. Maybe just one more on that – what is the time to get a new sales rep productive that has experience or domain expertise?
William J. Lansing - Fair Isaac Corp.: The sales cycle takes the better part of half the year, almost three quarters of the year, like 270 days sales cycle. And then if you figure that it takes months, several months, three months to six months to get a salesperson sufficiently familiar with our products to be effective, we're talking about really a year – when we onboard them and turn them into highly productive salespeople. Occasionally, we do better than that when we bring in people with deep experience. As I said, a very successful strategy for us has been to grow them internally, so if we can bring in people on, we have them as business development reps or inside sales or in marketing and they learn our products and become familiar with what we have and then we move them into the field. We find that that is a really nice transition and we have them productive little quicker when we do it that way.
Matthew Galinko - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And there are no further questions.
Steven P. Weber - Fair Isaac Corp.: Okay. Thank you, Amanda. This concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. And we'll talk to you next quarter.
Operator: That does conclude today's call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Kelly and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fair Isaac Corporation Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Steve Weber, you may begin your conference.
Steven P. Weber - Vice President, Treasurer & Investor Relations: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining FICO's third quarter earnings call. I am Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike Pung. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular, in the Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website, or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through July 28, 2017. With that, I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. I'll briefly summarize our financial results for this quarter, and then I'll discuss the progress we're making on our strategic initiatives. In our third quarter, we reported revenues of $239 million, the highest single quarter in company history, up 14% from the same period last year. We delivered $35 million of GAAP net income or $1.08 per share, both up 76% from the prior year. We delivered $47 million of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS of $1.45 per share, both increasing 45% from the same period last year. We continue our strong cash generation with $78 million of free cash flow this quarter. Most importantly, we had strong quarter across the board, with growth in each of our segments. Our Scores segment delivered $61 million of revenue this quarter, an increase of 10% over the same period last year. Our Applications segment revenue of $142 million was an increase of 11% over the same period last year. Finally, our Tools segment, which includes our Decision Management Suite, delivered a record $36 million, up 36% from last year. Much of the growth this quarter came from an exceptionally large number of license deals, but we also continue to add to a recurring revenue base. We've made tremendous progress on our strategic initiatives and we're starting to see the results of our hard work. Our B2B Scores business continues its healthy growth. Volumes are up across all life cycles and revenues are up 11% year-over-year. FICO Score use among lenders is as strong as ever and increase volumes prove that financial institutions rely on the Score to find new customers, as well as manage and monitor risk. We are also continuing to make progress with our consumer business. We recently announced an agreement with Progrexion, a market leader in credit report repair services to provide FICO Scores to consumers. We also signed our first affinity deal through a license with Experian. The non-bank deal is smaller in size, but it is an important proof point for us. We expect both of these to ramp-up by the end of the calendar year. And earlier this month, we partnered with Discover to power their first of its kind credit scorecard, which allows consumers, even those who are not Discover customers, to see their FICO Score for free. With over 150 million accounts accessing their FICO Scores through Open Access, it's now easier than ever for consumers to regularly see their FICO Score. This is good for consumers, as they can understand and improve their credit worthiness, and it's good for FICO as consumers understand that the FICO Score is overwhelmingly the score that matters for lending decisions. Because of this, we believe that FICO Scores can be a key differentiator for businesses marketing various financial services. We are continuing to make progress with opportunities in this market, as evidenced by the deals we completed this quarter, and we expect more to follow. On the software side, our investments are continuing to pay off. We are winning deals and are building a nice pipeline. This quarter, we closed a number of license deals with particularly strong sales in our Banking Fraud and Blaze product lines. Overall, we had a strong sales effort this quarter. Our bookings this quarter were $79 million, up 31% over the prior year. Fiscal year-to-date, our bookings are up 42% over last year. Many of these bookings are enabling our recurring revenues growth. This quarter, our recurring revenue is up 6% from last year, and year-to-date, recurring revenues are up 9%. This has been a key part of our strategy as we build out our cloud business and increase predictable recurring revenues. And we continue to innovate. Last quarter, I gave an update on Version 2.0 of the Decision Management Suite. We generated a lot of interest at FICO World in April and we're now meeting with potential customers to help them solve their toughest decisions. We also announced the introduction of our Enterprise Security Score, which will help rank an organization's level of cyber security risk. To further this effort, we acquired QuadMetrics, an innovative cyber risk security scoring company. QuadMetrics leverages predictive analytics to monitor signals from open source and proprietary data sources to provide an overall security score for an enterprise, helping security professionals address gaps and enabling partners and insurers to understand a firm's security risk. QuadMetrics will complement our own FICO Falcon Cybersecurity Analytics for threat detection and will create an easy-to-understand metric that will facilitate board level risk assessment, third-party vendor management, and cyber breach insurance underwriting. Along with a score, the product will provide current threat profile characteristics and granular insights into potential security issues. As always, we remain focused on driving shareholder value. This quarter and year-to-date, we've increased our margin by 400 basis points, and our strong cash flow has enabled us to bring our leverage down this fiscal year, while still returning 118 through our share repurchase program. I'll share some summary thoughts later, but now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike for further financial details.
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll emphasize three points in my prepared comments. First of all, we delivered $239 million of revenue, up 14% over the same period last year, and $1.08 of GAAP EPS and $1.45 of non-GAAP EPS, an increase of 76% and 45% year-over-year, respectively. Second, we delivered $78 million of free cash flow this quarter and $147 million year-to-date, an increase of 122%. We completed our most recent share repurchase plan and today we announced that our board reauthorized a new $250 million plan. Finally, we are updating our bottom-line guidance to reflect the higher margin revenues and resulting lower than expected expenses we are driving this year. I'll begin by breaking the revenue down into our three reported segments. Starting with Applications, revenues were $142 million, up 11% versus the prior year. This was driven by increased license sales in Fraud Management Solutions, increased transactional volumes in Customer Communication Services, and increased license and services revenues in Origination Solutions compared to last the year. The quarter Applications bookings were up 59% versus the same period last year. In the Tools segment revenues were $36 million, up 36% versus the prior year. This is the largest revenue quarter ever for Tools, led by increased license sales of Blaze Advisor and the FICO Decision Management Platform. Finally, our Scores segment was also strong, with revenues of $61 million, up 10% from the same period last year. On the B2B side, we're up 11%, and on the Consumer Scores revenue, we're up 7% from the same quarter last year. Looking at revenues by region. This quarter, 72% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region, our EMEA region generated 20% and the remaining 8% was from Asia Pacific. Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter represented 64% of total revenue. Consulting and implementation revenues were 19% of total and license revenues were 17% of total revenue. We signed $79 million of bookings this quarter, up 31% from the prior year. We generated $22 million of current period revenue on those bookings, for a yield of 28%. The weighted average term for our bookings this quarter was 28 months. Year-to-date, we have signed $298 million of bookings, up 42% from last year. Operating expenses totaled $183 million this quarter compared to $168 million in the prior quarter. The increase relates to variable costs associated with the increased revenue, wages and performance-based incentives and the cost related to FICO World. As you can see in our Reg G schedule, our non-GAAP operating margin was 30% in the third quarter and 27% year-to-date. We expect that operating margin to be between 27% and 28% for the full year. GAAP net income this quarter was $35 million, up 76% from the prior year. Non-GAAP net income was $47 million for the quarter, up 45% from the same quarter of last year. The effective tax rate was about 30% this quarter. We expect the effective tax rate to be about 28% to 29% for the full year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $78 million, compared to $34 million in the prior year. For the trailing 12-month, cash flow was $186 million, up 42% from the previous year. Turning to the balance sheet, we had $118 million in cash at the end of the quarter. Our total debt is $601 million, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.4%. The ratio of our total net debt to adjusted EBITDA is 2 times, which is below the covenant level of 3 times. During the quarter, we returned $32 million in excess cash to our investors, repurchasing 289,000 shares at an average price of $111.06. We also repurchased an additional 154,000 shares in the month of July for a total of $18 million. Year-to-date, we have returned $118 million to shareholders through our repurchase plan. Today, we announced our board has approved a new authorization for $250 million, as our previous authorization was exhausted this last month. We continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. We also continue to actively evaluate opportunities to acquire relevant technologies and products that advance our strategy or strengthen our portfolio and competitive position. Finally, we are updating our previously provided guidance for the fiscal year. We're now changing our revenue guidance, which we expect to be $860 million to $870 million. To achieve the top end of this guidance, we will need to sign about $28 million of license revenue in the fourth quarter. We now believe GAAP net income will be between $98 million to $102 million, up from the previously guided $94 million to $98 million. We expect GAAP earnings per share of $3.03 to $3.15, up from $2.89 to $3.02. Non-GAAP net income, we expect to be $145 million to $149 million, up from $144 million to $148 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.50 to $4.62, up from $4.43 to $4.55. With that, I'll turn it back to Will for some final comments.
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Mike. Next quarter, we'll talk about our expectations for 2017, but for now I'd like to step back and summarize our strategy. In Scores, we're looking to extend our B2B leadership and brand value into the consumer market. At the same time, we're pursuing innovations such as FICO Score XD to open new markets with financial services institutions. In Applications, we've developed cloud-enabled versions of our products, while expanding sales coverage and productivity to reach new markets. And in our Tools business, we've invested in our Decision Management Suite to provide a simple cost-effective method for customers of any size to develop and deploy analytics. At the same time, we're very focused on making appropriate investments throughout the portfolio and using excess cash for share repurchases and M&A. So far, we've been happy with the results, and I firmly believe that we have the management team in place to succeed in the months and the years ahead. I'll now turn the call back to Steve so we can do questions-and-answers.
Steven P. Weber - Vice President, Treasurer & Investor Relations: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks and we're ready now to take any questions you may have. Operator, please open the line.
Operator: Our first question comes from the line of Brett Huff from Stephens. Your line is open.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Good afternoon, guys. Congrats on a nice quarter.
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Just wanted to ask if you could characterize a little bit more some of the big license wins. It looks like it came in both in Tools and in Applications. And then maybe more specifically, were any of those a continuation of the DMS win from last quarter or was there a new DMS win in there?
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: So, Brett, this is Mike. So you're right. We had two large renewals on the Applications section for our Falcon Fraud product. One of the two new renewals had additional services, additional licenses associated with it, and the other was a straight renewal. In the Tools business, we actually had a large Blaze renewal that drove a lot of that increase. That one also came along with an up-sell.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. And then just given that the guidance didn't go up on revenue, did some of this just happen earlier maybe than we on the Street had modeled them or was this incremental in any way and is there just sort of conservatism in the rev guidance?
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: No, I think your first point is right. I mean as we all know, it's hard to determine what period a license occurs, including renewals. Sometimes they happen a little earlier, sometimes they happen a little later. And what we saw this quarter is some nice big renewals, some of which earlier than what we had expected. So I think what people were modeling in the fourth quarter likely happened in the third quarter, and probably the reverse is true.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. And then last question, and I'll get back in the queue. Could you just comment on DMS progress? How the win from last quarter is going? And then if you did have a chance to close additional ones of those or how the pipeline is looking?
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: Yes, so the deal we closed last quarter were in the implementation cycle right now for a large customer. That will happen as we described last quarter through the fall and into the end of the calendar year when the expected go-live will happen. The project is going great. It's on track. Things are moving along very well. In terms of the rest of the DMS in the cloud business, we're also seeing continued progress being made very positively. The revenue year-to-date in cloud is up 12% year-to-date. Bookings, about 30% of our year-to-date bookings are related to the cloud, much of which is DMS. And so, the progress is coming along nicely, probably never fast enough, but very nice at that.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Great; that's what I need. I'll jump back in the queue.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good afternoon, everyone.
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: Hi, Bill.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So, congratulations on a strong quarter, I'll say.
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: Thank you.
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: Thanks.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So, a couple questions for you. One is just to ask about how things are going in the affinity market. You had mentioned the Progrexion deal whether – and then to ask whether there's revenue being generated from that. And then also, if you could talk about how the pipeline of opportunities looks in that space now.
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: The Progrexion deal will unfold in the course of the year. So it's started, but the full impact won't be felt until later on, but that's going very smoothly. Our efforts in the affinity space continue and we're in discussions. I would say that in general, the whole affinity business, as you know, has gone more slowly than we expected. We thought that it would have a much more steep ramp in 2016 then it's had. Some of that I think is related to just kind of slow adoption, but sounds likes it's also that the market is evolving in different kind of ways. And I think that our Scores people are coming up with some innovative programs that complement some of things that are place now that – I hate to call them a substitute for affinity, but there are different kinds of programs and they represent different directions that the affinity business has gone. So I think you're still going to see FICO Scores in the center of all this. It may not all lined up in the affinity business as we originally envisioned it.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yeah. These transactions – there's been speculation that a large deal would be somewhere in the $40 million in revenue arena, maybe netting out $8 million in EBITDA. Is that about the level to think about for these types of deals or is it just -
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: I think it depends on whether we're the general contractor or whether we're just supplying FICO Scores to someone else who does it. I think that the economics that you just described would represent a large deal, if we were the GC. I do think that we favor working through partners and where there is others, for example, Experian, who can do a good job on offering the service, we're happy to partner with them, provide our Scores and value add that way. And obviously, at that point, it's much smaller revenue, but much higher margin. (20:47)
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: I'm sorry, Bill. In fact, today, in Will's prepared comments that he made reference to the fact that we did sign our first affinity partner today through Experian. So we did sign an affinity deal. We're a provider of the FICO Score to Experian and their servicing that deal. It's rather small for us on, but it was the first and a good proof point.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Excellent. And then there's been a lot of talk about trended data and I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the new product that you guys are coming out with on the trended data side in the auto space with TransUnion.
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: Yeah. We're making progress with TransUnion. We announced that deal last quarter. We're working with them to bring it into the marketplace. And beyond that, I really don't have anything new to discuss around that. We've been involved with or in discussions with each of the bureaus and a variety of ways on their trended data initiatives. But for us, it frankly isn't as big of a driver as some of the other activities we have going on.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. Thank you very much. I'll get back in the queue.
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: Great.
Operator: Your next question comes from line Robert Mattson from Dougherty Markets. Your line is open.
Robert Mattson - Dougherty & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you and congrats on the quarter as well. I wanted to circle up in a couple things. One is kind of an admin thing. I missed that number you said that the high end of the guidance would require on license?
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: It would require about $28 million of license revenue to hit our high end in the guidance range.
Robert Mattson - Dougherty & Co. LLC: Okay. I wanted to circle up with the Decision Management. You got 2.0 out now. A lot of – historically, a lot of enterprise is a little hesitant to do a 1.0 until 2.0 comes out. Have you seen a change in the discussion, a willingness of people now to engage around Decision or has this not really changed and things are cruising along?
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: No, things are going very smoothly with a lot of customer interest in Decision Management Suite and actually, we're at work on 3.0 and the move from 2.0 to 3.0 is very fluid and easy. And so although you're right that customers are reluctant to be the guinea pigs on a 1.0, we're well past that. We have DMS deployed in a lot of places now. It's working really well. We have happy customers. And so we're kind of through all that early pains.
Robert Mattson - Dougherty & Co. LLC: Okay. And outside if you could talk a little bit about additional traction outside of your core markets on the Decision Management Suite? Any – I don't know whether you want to talk about in terms of pilots or whatever color you can give on how you're getting traction outside there?
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: Well, last quarter, we did this big telecom deal, which would be outside of kind of our core markets. But frankly, telecom is becoming a core market because we have a lot of telecom customers. So we continue to be heavily focused on financial services. I think that's the reality, but it is the case that our stuff works elsewhere, we're getting interest from other verticals. I think there's more rapid adoption outside of financial services of cloud-based solutions. So what we're seeing is a disproportionate cloud mix when you go outside of financial services. That would be one difference.
Robert Mattson - Dougherty & Co. LLC: Okay. And then I guess the last question more of a ad hoc question. Any update on the progress in terms of continuing to hire sales people?
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: Oh, yeah. Well, we're continuing to pound away at it and we're happy with our efforts. I would say that never enough. So we still have open head count. We're still hiring and we'll hire every talented salesperson that we can find. But as you know we obviously hold these candidates to a very high standard and so it never goes fast enough, but yes, continued progress.
Robert Mattson - Dougherty & Co. LLC: Thank you and congrats again.
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Klauber with William Blair. Your line is open.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good afternoon. Just a couple of follow-up. In Applications, you mentioned that Falcon had a pretty good renewal and then an upgrade. Could you just give us a flavor or what's the nature of the upgrade?
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: Yes. The nature of the upgrade is we have a variety of broad related products that go along with the Falcon product. There are additional analytic models and additional analytic technologies. And we had a client, a very large non-U.S. client, renew their Falcon platform. And in the process of doing the renewal, they purchased some additional technology that complemented Falcon.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. I guess that up-sell is that newer technology or is that just core product that they haven't been using before?
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: It's a newer version of core product that they hadn't been using before.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Okay. That's helpful. Then you mentioned cyber, your cyber security offering, and I realize that's new, but can you give us an idea of what we could look for next year to see if that effort is ramping up?
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: Sure. So we're quite serious about our cyber security initiative. What we have is an opportunity to take our really fabulous Falcon Fraud IP and apply it in the cyber security space. And so where we had little missing pieces, we went out and bought QuadMetrics. But I would say that it's a pretty nascent effort. The product is coming along very rapidly. We announced the enterprise security score and we ought to be in a position to be selling it by the end of the year. But I think that realistically it's going to be small dollars and in the greater scheme of things in 2017, only because it take a while to ramp a specialized sales force and to get traction, but the product'll be ready and will be in the marketplace, and it's just going to take a while to get recognition.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, okay. That's helpful. And then finally on capital – cash, capitalization utilization, as the stock price has clearly done well in the last six months or so, does that change your view on buying back stock?
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: No, not at all. I mean, you could have made that comment every quarter for the last 20 quarters and it would've been true that the stock price had done well and you could be questioning whether it would make sense for us to keep buying back our stock at these levels. So far it's been a winning bet for us and we remain as optimistic about our future as ever. And every time we think about alternate uses of cash, when we measure them against investing in our own business, we really love our own prospects. And so we wind up coming down over and over and over in favor of stock purchase over M&A. That's not say we never would do it, but so far the stock repurchase really looks great. I guess a corollary to that embedded in your question is a little bit of a question around market timing. We're not market timers. We can't really speak to whether the overall market is frothy and will continue or will it get the correction. You guys are in that business, we're not. But we feel strongly that our business is strong today and it's going to be better in the future. And so we think it's a good use of cash to keep buying back our own stock.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then actually one final follow-up. You obviously had a strong quarter all around, but particularly your net – your free cash really jumped up. Should – I mean it's much, much higher level. Is that just reflecting a lot of the momentum in the quarter or is that continual (28:51)
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: It's a couple of things. Yeah, I wouldn't multiply it by four, put it that way.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Right. Yeah.
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: But the contributing factors are, one, yes, the strong license revenue had an effect. And two, we had improvement in DSO. So, those two things were the things that gave us the outstanding result this quarter. So, I wouldn't expect that that would be that kind of strong in the future.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So one follow-up for you. Just wanted to make sure to ask about the Discover opportunity that you announced last quarter. Just ask how that's ramping? When – have you started to generate revenue from it? If not, what do you think the timeline is likely to be?
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: We're super excited about this. So the program, just to be clear what it is, Discover Scorecard, is a Discover driven website where consumers, both Discover customers and non-customers, can come and get their FICO Score. And then, Discover obviously works through that, making credit offers. And so it's a prospecting kind of an opportunity. That's kind of a new space for us. We haven't really used our FICO Scores for any kind of lead gen or prospecting in the past, not this directly. And so this is a new opportunity. We're very excited about doing it with Discover. They leaned into it with radio advertising and with television advertising. We're very happy about the messaging in the program, because they are focused on, among other things, pointing out the differences between a genuine FICO Score and the other scores that lenders don't actually use for making lending decisions. So, Discover has some uniqueness in their offering. It's too early to speak about the results and I wouldn't be in a position to do it. It would be for Discover to discuss that. But early returns are good and we're happy.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. All right. Thank you very much.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to presenters.
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: Thank you. Now this concludes our call for today. Thank you all for your interest and joining. And we will see you next quarter.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Alex and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fair Isaac Corporation quarterly earnings call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Steve Weber, you may begin your conference.
Steven P. Weber - Vice President, Treasurer & Investor Relations: Thank you, Alex. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining FICO's second quarter earnings call. I am Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike Pung. Today we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this quarter, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular, in the Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website, or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through May 4, 2017. With that, I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. I'll briefly summarize our financial results for the quarter, and then I'll discuss the progress we're making on our strategic initiatives. In our second quarter, we reported revenues of $207 million. We delivered $23 million of GAAP net income, $0.72 per share, both up 23% from the prior year. We delivered $35 million of non-GAAP net income, up 18% from last year, and non-GAAP EPS of $1.09 per share, an increase of 20% from the same period last year. Most importantly, we signed $132 million of bookings, up 67% from the previous year. This included a large cloud-based engagement that will drive significant recurring revenue for the next several years. In fact, our transactional bookings this quarter were up 234% over the same period last year. This is a validation of our cloud products strategy and also an important driver of our recurring revenue in future periods. Our Scores segment delivered $61 million of revenue this quarter, an increase of 22% over the same period last year, and the highest Scores revenue quarter in the history of the company. The consumer piece grew 42%, and now represents one-third of Scores revenue. Our B2B business is also performing well and is up 14% year-over-year. Our Applications segment was down 9% over the same period last year, which included two very large up-front license sales. Many of our sales this quarter were transactional, with revenues to be recognized in future periods. Our Tools segment was up 4% over the same period last year. We're now just past the halfway mark in our fiscal year, and we're making significant progress on our strategic initiatives. Our B2B Scores business is experiencing healthy growth, with volumes up across all life cycles over the prior year. And we just announced the general availability of FICO Score XD last week, at FICO World. There is substantial interest among lenders for this innovative product, and we'll keep you posted on how that interest unfolds in the coming months. We continue to make significant progress on our B2C business. We recently announced that we crossed another milestone in our Open Access program. 150 million consumer accounts now have regular access to FICO Scores for free. We recently added Wells Fargo and Bank of America to the program. We're also pursuing new opportunities in Consumer Scores. This quarter, we signed an agreement with a specialty reseller of reports and scores to provide FICO Scores to consumers. This agreement will ramp over the course of the year, and is expected to be fully implemented by the end of calendar 2016. We believe that FICO Scores can be a key differentiator for businesses marketing various financial services, and are pursuing a range of opportunities in this market. We expect to soon announce programs that will allow lenders to make FICO Scores available for the first time to non-customers. While the potential of this is difficult to quantify at this point, we are excited about it, and we'll update you in the coming quarters. On the software side, our decision management products are continuing to gain traction. As I mentioned, we had a record number of bookings this quarter. One large deal bundles elements of the FICO Decision Management Suite, including our marketing, originations and other analytic applications, into a SaaS solution that will produce profitable recurring revenues when it goes live this fall. Recurring revenues from our cloud-based offerings continue to grow. Year to date, revenue growth was 8%. More importantly, bookings have grown over 300% compared to the previous year, so those bookings point to a recurring revenue stream that will propel revenue growth in future quarters. This cloud strategy has been a key long-term growth initiative. We've focused investments on expanding our cloud offerings, and more recently, our distribution channels. The FICO Decision Management Suite 2.0, unveiled at FICO World last week, represents a major leap forward in the practice of prescriptive analytics and decision management. It provides everything businesses of all sizes need to rapidly develop innovative analytic applications and improve business decisions. The expanded suite of analytic tools offers a unified and more intuitive user interface. Business analysts can now model a decision using FICO Decision Management Notation Modeler, and put it into production with the Decision Management platform, without involving IT. Our new FICO Strategy Director gives users control over decision flow structure. We also announced a partnership with iboss, to combine their web security platform with patented FICO Cyber Analytics for detecting and remediating cyber attacks. We believe this solution will reduce the dwell time before an attack is recognized, which is often months in duration. These were among many announcements at our FICO World Conference last week, where I heard directly from our customers around the world how these products are helping them transform their businesses by making better decisions. There's, for example, the insurer that is using the FICO Decision Management Suite to reduce enrollment time from 22 days to six minutes, enabling it to double volumes while keeping cost flat and improving the quality of customer interactions. For another customer that used FICO Text Analytics solutions (7:16) take millions of unstructured legal documents and incorporate analytics and machine learning to improve fraud and abuse detection. We helped a European Bank put Agile Champion/Challenger, Simulations which previously required IT development, into the hands of business users who were able to define, configure and control the solutions themselves quickly, and thereby gain important competitive advantage. Another bank I heard from is now deploying Enterprise Fraud Management at the customer level across the lifecycle to significantly decrease fraud and reduce false positives. We're in the beginning stages of delivering tremendous innovation to our customers, and much of it's cloud-based, generating recurring revenue. If you have not already done so, I would encourage you to watch the FICO World webcast on our website by our Chief Technology Officer, Stuart Wells and his team. It's a great overview of how our technology is enhancing the way customers manage decisions. Of course, we do all of this with an eye toward driving shareholder value. We were again able to increase year-over-year margin by 200 basis points, even with more ratable bookings as opposed to upfront license fees. We do this by remaining disciplined about cost control and by pursuing high-margin revenues. Combined with our ongoing repurchase program, we continually look for ways to leverage our growth and ways that maximizes value for our shareholders. I'll share some summary thoughts later, but let me now turn it back over to Mike.
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: Thanks, Will. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll emphasize three points in my comments. First, we delivered $207 million of revenue, flat with last year, due to fewer upfront license deals but with a 9% increase in recurring revenue. Second, we had $132 million of bookings this quarter, much of it transactional, which will generate around $12 million to $15 million of annual recurring revenue beginning next year. Finally, we delivered $0.72 of GAAP EPS and $1.09 of non-GAAP EPS, which is an increase of 20% year-over-year, driven from growth in our Scores revenue and improving margins in our Implementation Services. Now, I'll begin by breaking the revenue down into our three segments. Starting with applications, revenues were $122 million, up 1% sequentially but down 9% versus the same period last year. This decrease was due to a decline in license revenue this quarter. The prior year included two large term license agreements with upfront revenue associated with them. As we continue to sell more cloud-based deals, our transaction-based applications bookings and revenue will continue to grow. This quarter, application bookings were up 112%, versus the same period last year. In the Tools segment, revenues were $24 million, up 4% versus the prior year. We continue to invest in sales and distribution in order to drive growth in this part of the business. Finally, we had our largest Scores quarter ever, with revenue of $61 million, up 22% from the same period last year. On the B2B side, we're up 14% from last year. In the Consumer Scores revenue, we're up 42% from the same quarter last year. As a reminder, our agreement with Experian will lap in our third quarter, making for tougher comps going forward. Looking at revenues by region, this quarter, 74% of total revenue were derived from the Americas. Our EMEA region generated 19%, and the remaining 7% was from Asia Pacific. Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter represented 73% of total revenue. Consulting and implementation revenues were 19% of total, and license revenues were 8% of total revenue. We signed a record amount of bookings this quarter, at $132 million, up 67% from the prior-year quarter. We generated $18 million of current period revenues on those bookings for a yield of 13%, which means we've built a significant amount of revenue that will be recognized in later periods. This quarter's bookings should drive $12 million to $15 million of new annual recurring revenues, starting next year. The weighted average term for our bookings this quarter was 55 months, reflecting the large multi-year agreements we signed in comparison to prior periods. Operating expenses totaled $168 million this quarter, compared to $169 million in the prior quarter. Entering the year, we restructured our expenses in order to reinvest the savings in sales and distribution of our products. We expect the rate and pace of these investments to grow in the back half of the year proportionately with the growth in our pipeline and associated revenue from our new products, and as we incur the implementation costs associated with the deals that we have booked to date. As you can see in our Reg G schedule, our non-GAAP operating margin was 27% for the second quarter and 26% year to date. We expect that operating margin to be in the 26% to 28% for the full year. GAAP net income this quarter was $23 million, up 23% from the prior year, and non-GAAP net income was $35 million for the quarter, up 18% from the same quarter last year. The effective tax rate was about 28% this quarter, and we still expect the effective tax rate to be about 28% to 30% for the full year of fiscal year 2016. The free cash flow for the quarter was $34 million, compared to $37 million in the prior year. For the trailing 12 months, free cash flow was $143 million, up 17% from the previous periods. Turning to the balance sheet, we had $85 million in cash at the end of the quarter. Our total debt is $611 million, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.3%. The ratio of our total net debt to adjusted EBITDA is 2.3 times, well below the covenant level of 3 times. During the quarter, we returned $40 million in excess cash to our investors, by repurchasing 420,000 shares at an average price of $95.26. Year-to-date, we have returned substantially all of our free cash flow to the shareholder. We still have $51 million remaining on the latest board authorization, and continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. We also continue to actively evaluate opportunities to acquire relevant technologies and products that advance our strategy and strengthen our portfolio and competitive position. Finally, we are reiterating our previously provided guidance for the full fiscal year. With that, I'll turn it back over to Will for some final comments.
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Mike. Halfway through our fiscal 2016, I'm pleased with the progress we're making on several fronts. Our Scores business is delivering record revenues, and we're pursuing additional growth opportunities as we expand into new markets and distribution channels. On the software side, the last few years have been an innovation renaissance at FICO. Our technologies have been refreshed, expanded and cloud-enabled, to serve a broadening market that's eager to use analytics to make more precise decisions more quickly. We've made substantial progress in the last five years, but I believe the best is ahead of us. We're on the cusp of a revolution, as companies everywhere look for ways to use data and analytics to automate and improve their decisioning. This is the promise that FICO was founded on 60 years ago. And with our portfolio of industry-leading technologies, we're better positioned than ever to deliver on that promise. With that, I'll turn it back to Steve for Q&A.
Steven P. Weber - Vice President, Treasurer & Investor Relations: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we're now ready to take your questions. Operator, please open the line.
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is open.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Good evening, gentlemen. I wanted to first just get some color from you guys on the 14% growth on the B2B side of things. If you can just flesh out the drivers of that growth, were there any one-time big contracts or projects like we've seen in the past, or just if you can break down that 14% for us, that would be helpful.
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: Sure, Manav. So the 14% was driven primarily from across-the-board volume increases in what we call the lifecycles of how we sell the scores, so ranging from prescreened to new account openings through account management. Across the board, the range grew somewhere in that 10% to 14%. We did have a one-time true-up of a prior-year number that was relatively minor and even if you back that out, we were still – are a high-single digit growth across the Scores business.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So when we think about the next couple of quarters, and we look at comps and the one-time true-up and everything, is high-single digit probably then the reasonable number we should be modeling?
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: Well, on the B2B side, that would continue to be a very ambitious number for us to see, and it is really dependent upon continued health in the consumer lending that's going on in the U.S. This is probably the fourth quarter in a row where we've had high-single digit or greater. And it's hard to predict whether that trend stays there for the next couple of quarters, but so far, reports are coming in quite strong.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then, Will, in your prepared remarks, I think you talked about, it was on the B2C side, a contract, I think it sounds like a new contract you signed with a reseller to sell your Scores. And then I think you also mentioned something else in the works in terms of giving your Scores to non-lenders, I believe. If you can just clarify those two, if they were separate, and maybe a little bit more color on each?
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, it's not non-lenders, it's to non-customers. So the thought there is, our Open Access program is to share scores with our customers' customers. And so this is more in the category of acquiring new customers, so it's a little bit of an exploration of a new business model for us.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. So – sorry, so were you talking about two different opportunities when you referred to something around the resellers, or were those tied together?
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: No, those are different opportunities.
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: Yes, so there were two thoughts, Manav. The first thought was, we signed a second deal to distribute our FICO Score for a fee through a distributor. It's not a bureau, it's a – other kind of participant in the marketplace who uses scores and reports as a central part of their business model.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay.
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: That deal was signed, and it's beginning to get tested and will be rolled out towards the end of our fiscal year. So our first meaningful revenue will begin to hit next fiscal year for us on that. And the second thought is the one that Will talked about, which is expanding the use of the FICO Score beyond a limited use for Open Access, providing a free score and a couple of reason codes. This would be providing that type of information to non-customers for things like pre-qualification and other activities. The testing that we're doing in that area and that we plan to do are not for free; they're for service fee.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So is the latter one more like lead generation?
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. You could call it that.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And so just – sorry, on both these then, I guess, we'll get more color as the testing continues? Or (19:32)...
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: No, that's exactly right.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: ...that we missed? Or just trying to understand how we should model or size this.
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: Well, I don't know there is anything to model yet, but we have our toe in the water, is a way to think about it. And I think it looks promising, and we'll have to see over the coming quarters, whether this turns into a new line of business for us or not. It's new for us, so we're exploring it.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then last one for me. Clearly, your PR team was busy during FICO World. I mean we saw a whole bunch of press releases coming out, which was probably expected, but if you could help us just narrow it down to the key takeaways from FICO World, how much of that is more – just sort of lead gen with your customers, versus how much new business you really got? Is that why the $132 million of backlog?
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: Well, I would say, they're related but not really related. So the FICO World is a huge event, and it's been going on for 40 years. And it's our goal for it to be the Davos of analytics. We take it ever-more seriously every year. And this year, this program that we've put on for a thousand bankers and data scientists and analysts and people focused on decisioning who come together to explore the latest and greatest in technology, was really an incredible event. Of course, a lot of business gets done at the event, and we have – the majority of the people who are at the event are our customers, and we explore ways in which we can use our technology to expand our relationship with the customers, but there is also a ton of people we have not yet done business with, and we spend a lot of time working with them on how to – again, how to use our products and solutions to move along their business. So it's – I'm not sure how to answer your question, except to say, it's a big event in its own right, and it is a big driver of business for us.
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: Okay. None of the bookings this quarter, though, came from FICO World. FICO World was last week, so...
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: (21:38).
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: It would be a future booking.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Fair enough. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Huff from Stephens. Your line is open.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions.
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: No problem.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: First question is, can you give us a little more detail on the big – I think you said it was an applications deal, and it was – it sounds like it was more SaaS focused. First of all, is that right? And can you just give us more detail on that? And is that the kind of deal that – I know that you all are striving for – and is that kind of the model going forward? And are there any others kind of in the pipeline of that size? I know it sounds like it was a big one.
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, Brett. Thanks for asking the question. It's probably worth putting a little more color around it. The deal is a very large one, in the tens of millions. It's large by any standard for us. And what's interesting for us and what I think is notable is not so much the size of it, which of course we're all delighted about, but the fact that it leverages our latest and greatest technology. So it's built on Decision Management Suite, which is our latest offering where we've taken all of our analytics, IT and put them into a platform. And the beauty of this platform is that it's incredibly flexible. It's really easy to hobble (22:52) together different pieces of functionality to have a solution that crosses a lot of different things. So in this case, yes it is a SaaS offering. It's a cloud offering. It straddles different areas of our IP, so it's originations as well as marketing solutions, and it's also outside of financial services, so it's a pretty major step in terms of diversifying beyond financial services. So on kind of a bunch of our strategic desires, this deal really is tremendous: diversification and cloud and Decision Management Suite, all at once. And then with respect to the size, Decision Management Suite is not just designed for a monster deal, it's highly flexible, and can be used for small deals as well. And so we are focused at FICO at having a pretty wide range of solutions. And singles and doubles are also terrific, and we do lots of deals for $100 million dollars and are delighted to do it. We can create a ton of value for our customers with pretty fast to implement and pretty easy to build solutions wrapped around Decision Management Suite. At the same time, the power is there to do really, really monster deals.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: And are there others like this? Is that the new platform? Is that opening some doors? And should we – is this the kind of thing where there is a big one every – periodically, I know it's hard to predict, but are those the kind of discussions that you're finding that you're having? And are those moving down towards (24:21)?
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: I think that's exactly and it's hard to predict. There is no question that the capability is there, and certainly the desire on our part to do very large deals is there. We like to do deals that are transformational for our customers, and so how frequently will these occur? Will they become a regular part of our business? I sure hope so. But I don't think you can model it. This is quite a big one.
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: Brett, I think it's safe to say that DMS has made us a fairly new and unique vendor in these kinds of offerings, wherein the past we likely wouldn't have made the final cut on it, and now we're seeing wins.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then on the – just kind of stepping back on all SaaS revenue, I know that you've got a number of different sort of SaaSification methods (25:08) or projects going on. Can you just give us an update of where we are, if you can quantify that on a percentage of your revenue that SaaS, and maybe distinguish that from hosted, and maybe distinguish that from the other versus maybe last year or sequentially?
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: Yeah. I'll be happy to do that. So all-in or all of our cloud business, which includes some of our legacy managed services business, so all-in our cloud business is around 22% of our total revenue, growing at about an 8% rate. If I put the managed services piece off to the side, which is on a small decline, the other parts of the business, which include products like Adeptra, Origination and Debt Manager on a cloud, examples that Will had given here, that's growing in the mid-teens, and in some cases greater than that. As a percent of bookings year-to-date, so halfway through the year, about one-third of our bookings are actually coming from cloud-related deals that we have signed over the past six months. And looking at our pipeline, we expect that to continue to be a pretty solid percent going forward as well.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: That's helpful. One other detailed question on that. Have you split sort of the managed services versus the SaaS? Can you give us – the 15%-plus grower, is that half of that 22%, or I mean (26:33) ballpark?
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: No. I'll give you ballpark. We haven't given that in the past. Give me a quick minute. I would say it's probably more like one-third managed services, one-third Adeptra, one-third the other Fair Isaac cloud – FICO Analytic cloud-type offerings, roughly.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: That's helpful. And then one question on the Scores. It sounds like the Experian deal is going well. And if I'm remembering right, that's fully ramped on all of their sites, or the majority of their sites? Or is there sort of more, whatever, organic kind of within that to go even before you start lapping it?
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: Well, it is fully ramped, but there is more (27:13), to go because they're doing – their business is going well.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. And then, I think you mentioned doing work with another partner that wasn't a bureau, but it is another person who uses your IP as sort of key to their business model. When you look out, I mean, how does that pipeline look? I know that maybe there are bigger, smaller deals, et cetera. How does that opportunity continue to look for you all now that Experian is kind of in the door has a big nice base on that extension?
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: There's continue – there continue to be opportunities on the horizon, more of the same kinds of things we do with Experian potentially, and then new business models as well, so there is a pretty wide range out there.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Great. That's exactly what I needed (27:55). Thank you for your time.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good afternoon, everyone.
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Bill.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: First of all, congratulations on the quarter. I mean with the booking and landing an affinity deal in the same quarter, congratulations. So...
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: Well, Bill – thanks. Just, Bill, just to clarify, it wasn't an affinity deal in the way we've been talking about affinity. It's a new kind of deal but it's not exactly an affinity deal. But yes, thank you, we'll take the congratulations all the same (28:34). Thanks.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So help me understand the new deal and how it differs from an affinity deal then. Maybe that would be a good place to start.
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: Well, how to distinguish it without getting into a level of detail that we don't really want to get into. So...
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Sorry.
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: No, so Bill, this is kind of maybe an off-the-radar kind of provider of credit report and credit score support organization for consumers around the U.S. And so they use scores and reports on a regular basis in coordination with the business that they do to their end-customer. And in the past, they have been using a educational score, and in order to improve their offering, they struck a deal with us to include the FICO Score. So we're not trying to be real vague on purpose, but we expect they'll be making their own announcements down the road. And we don't want to steal their thunder. On the other hand, we thought it's important to at least make our investors aware of the fact that we're continuing to make good progress in this area.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. So this would be, just to – in terms of putting it into buckets, this would be more in keeping with the Experian-type relationship. I mean, I don't...
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: ...know Experian is bureau, but I'm saying that would be more or like that.
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: I mean, you can characterize this as an affinity deal if you wanted to, it's just not the same players that we normally think of when we go thinking about that affinity business that we've talked about in the past.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it.
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: So it's a new player.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Well, on that topic of traditional affinity deals, how is that pipeline looking? Are you beta testing any of these – any of these – we've been talking about large banks as being some of the likely first movers in that space. Are you beta tasting with any of those large banks?
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: The pipeline continues to look good and we're in conversations, and some very early testing, but we're not really ready to talk about anything.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it.
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: Next quarter.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: That's right. Now, on the DMS side, maybe you could give us an update in terms of the number of customers that you have there, the number of salespeople there. It sounded like the sales cycle was relatively short compared to the other parts of the business.
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: So, everything about DMS is shorter. The sales cycle is a little shorter. The implementation cycle, for sure, is shorter. We can give you a sales – a dedicated sales number in a second, but I would caveat it by saying, DMS is becoming so much part of the fabric of our business, that we sell solutions to customers and we lead with the solution, not with the technology. We talk about what the solution is going to do for the customer, and not the underlying technology. And so, increasingly – and this shouldn't be a surprise to anyone, customers say, they look at the technology as part of the diligence afterwards, but it's not – we're not selling DMS. We're selling a solution, and then DMS is the way that we fulfill it. And, as a result, in addition to the dedicated sales staff that we have for DMS, we also have a ton of people who are not dedicated to DMS, but they know our solutions well, and they're out selling our solutions, and DMS as a service (32:04). So, I would say the dedicated sales number is misleading, because we actually have a lot more of our sales force selling DMS than just the people who have DMS on their hats. That said, we're in the high-20s, is that right?
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: On dedicated.
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: On dedicated DMS salespeople.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So it sounds like what's happening is that the DMS, basically, is broadening its appeal as a solution, so that more and more of your existing sales force is able to sell it and leverage it. Is that a way of -?
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, that's exactly right. I think what you're seeing is, what you're seeing is our business is starting to blend together. So we have – you could call it cannibalization, you can call it blurring of the lines – but basically, applications and tools and DMS are all blurring together. And what you have is decisioning and analytics IT, which we have incorporated in DMS and we like to sell it that way, although we still sell tools, and you can buy Blaze Rules engine all by itself. And you can buy applications dedicated to a particular solution all by itself. But the line is getting blurrier, so you're going to continue to see some amount of cannibalization. And we're actually careful to – we don't want turf wars internally with our salespeople. We want them to go put the best solution in front of the customer. And so they'll get paid whether it's DMS, or whether it's an application, or whether it's a custom tool solution.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And so the poster child for this new way of selling, so to speak, is this large applications deal, the SaaS deal, the one – tens of millions a deal.
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: Yes, the one we just did. That's right, that's a good example. Although it's not the first, and we've actually done others that were large deals also, not this large, but this is not the first. We now have quite a few DMS deals behind us. It's (34:00).
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Are these deals – I think one of the thoughts was that these deals were going to be outside of the financial services space, is that actually coming to fruition?
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I'd say that's mostly true, although DMS works for financial services just as well. So it's both. We happen to have done more deals outside than inside the financial services to-date, but I'm not sure how it's going to be in the future. I now would expect that lots of banks would be very interested in us.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And then, I wanted to ask for some help in terms of the modeling, in terms of where you thought expenses were going to come out by quarter over the next couple of quarters.
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: Yeah. Well, so we're sticking with our guidance for the full year. And what that would imply is that you'll see a step-up in our spend beginning in quarter three and into quarter four, kind of commensurate with the revenue ramp-up that we have built in to the plan for the back half of the year as well. There is a few things that are driving the ramp-up and the expenses. I'd say the main one is the hiring that we have done on the sales side. Since the beginning of the year, we've added about 48 salespeople across various parts of the company, and they have been layered in over the last six months with many of them coming in, in the last three months. And so you'll start to see a full quarter's worth of salary and commission expense associated with that hiring. We also held FICO World, which is kind of a one-time expense you'll see in our third quarter, from our last week's event. That's a fairly expensive event for us. And in addition to that, with the sizable bookings that we've done, there is a fair amount of implementation costs that are going to begin to hit our cost-to-revenue, along with the top-line implementation revenue. It will scale as the revenue does. So there'll be a noticeable increase in the back half of the year expenses for kind of those reasons and to the degree we continue to find a few good salespeople.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Well, again, congratulations on a really strong quarter. Thanks.
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: Thank you.
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Bill.
Operator: Your next question comes from Matthew Galinko of Sidoti. Your line is open.
Matthew Galinko - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions.
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Matt.
Matthew Galinko - Sidoti & Co. LLC: First one being how should we think about the pace of adoption of FICO XD over the next two quarters?
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: It's in test. It's been in successful test with 12 institutions and they're happy with their early returns. And so I would imagine that people are going to start turning it on. That said, I don't think that we can expect it to be a massive revenue driver any time soon. And I think we have to be realistic in our expectations. These things are long, slow build. In terms of who it applies to, we think that there is about 50 million people who were previously un-scoreable who are now scoreable with XD. So that's a pretty big TAM if you want to think about it that way. But I just think it's going to take time to build; it will ramp slowly. It's also more expensive than traditional FICO Scores, which is a little bit of a barrier.
Matthew Galinko - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Do you see a secondary distribution strategy for that going B2C like you do the traditional score? And...
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: We've...
Matthew Galinko - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Sorry.
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: We have thought about that. We don't have any immediate plans to do it, we've thought about it and we've been asked about it.
Matthew Galinko - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Okay. And then probably won't answer me on this, but excluding a large cloud deal, can you say what bookings growth looked like this quarter?
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: Matt, we're not going to break it apart, but you can probably back into it if you do a little bit of head scratching. I mean it was a very large deal.
Matthew Galinko - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Okay. Fair enough. And then you kind of alluded to your Decision Management 2.0 release and you called out the user interface getting a little bit more simple, can you just kind of qualify how important that is to your customer, to the people who have kicked the tires on this? Is it important that business users can implement models without going to the IT department?
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I mean that's – those are just a few little words, like doing models without going to the IT department, but they're pretty important words. A lot of things are going on with the Decision Management Suite, but essentially we've gotten to the point now where you can take decisions and break them down using Decision Model and Notation, and record the decision in a way that you can go back to afterwards. And so what you're doing is you're creating a knowledge repository in a business around its decisioning that opens up all kinds of possibilities. It lets you audit, it lets you go back and see what worked and what didn't work, and it gives – suddenly you're not at the mercy of whether an employee walks out the door carrying all the decisioning intelligence of the firm. The UI is quite important from a usability standpoint. So it's – when you don't have to go to IT to change things around, things get a lot easier. And that promises to be a pretty big deal for us. So I would say, yeah, that's not a trivial thing, it's a huge thing.
Matthew Galinko - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Great. All right. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Katelyn Young from William Blair. Your line is open.
Katelyn Young - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone.
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Katelyn.
Katelyn Young - William Blair & Co. LLC: First question, it sounds like you guys are continuing to invest in the sales and distribution side on the Tools segment. My question is do you think you'll be hiring more people than you thought you would have maybe a quarter ago or at the end of last year?
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: I wouldn't say more. Here is what I would say. I would say I wish it could be more, okay? I think we hire as many people as we can that we can bring in productively and that we think have the qualifications to sell our quite sophisticated offerings. We're probably hiring a little more slowly than we anticipated, and that's probably a little bit of wishful thinking on our part on how fast we could get people up to speed on our products and services and our IP. This is not a simple sale. This requires a really intelligent, highly-trained, sophisticated salesperson. It's a very complicative sale. We have a 270-day sales cycle, on average – now, of course, some things are much faster – but it's a different kind of sale than your average software sale. And so it's – I would say it's going more slowly than we would like. I wish we could make it go faster.
Katelyn Young - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then secondly on the one large contract, are you able to tell us which industry that client is in? It sounds like they are outside of the traditional FS space.
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: This is a telecom client. We've actually started to do a lot of work in telecom. FICO had a robust telecom business some years ago, and then telecom went through a downturn, and FICO went through a downturn, and we put a lot less focus on it. In fact we sold off some of that business. And more recently, especially with Decision Management Suite, we have offerings that are highly relevant and useful to that industry. And so we're seeing a lot of appetite both in the U.S. and overseas. And so we have quite a few telecom clients now, and that large one was a telecom deal.
Katelyn Young - William Blair & Co. LLC: That's great. And then, I guess just thinking more broadly about the pipeline, I know it's a lot of moving pieces to think about, but is there anything characteristically different about the pipeline now or that you're learning more about it than you had seen maybe six months or a year ago in terms of size, or types of customers who have a larger demand appetite?
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: I think one of the things that we're seeing that's really encouraging is that, in the past, people would – they'd have an analytics problem, a decisioning problem, they have a very high-stakes decision that needs to be made, and they'd come to us for a point solution for that kind of decisioning. It might be originations or line management and site triad (42:40) or some other kind of application decisioning. But usually some kind of point solution. And customers still think that way and buy that way. They come to you with their specific problem that we're trying to solve. But what's interesting is that with Decision Management Suite, because all of the IP is common underneath and you can do so much more than just solve a particular decision with it, what we're seeing is the discussion around deals and the scope of disillusion is expanding. And so I think the deals, they might be getting a little bit more complicated. They're certainly getting broader in function and in solution. That's a little bit different in the pipeline, but I wouldn't read too much into that. It's just early days on that but it feels good.
Katelyn Young - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Fair enough. Well, thank you. That's all I had.
Operator: No further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to the presenters.
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Steven P. Weber - Vice President, Treasurer & Investor Relations: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. This concludes our call.

Analysts: Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc. William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC James Rutherford - Stephens, Inc. Matthew Galinko - Sidoti & Company, LLC
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Caitlyn and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fair Isaac Corporation's Quarterly Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Steve Weber, you may begin your conference.
Steven P. Weber - Vice President, Treasurer & Investor Relations: Thank you, Caitlyn. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining today's FICO first quarter earnings call. I'm Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike Pung. Today we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to prior quarter, in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular in the Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website, or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through January 28, 2017. And now I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: Thanks, Steve, and thank you everyone for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. I will briefly summarize our financial results for this quarter and then I'll discuss some of our strategic initiatives and their expected impact. In our first quarter, we reported revenues of $200 million, an increase of 6% over the same period last year. We delivered $19 million of GAAP net income, up 34% from last year and GAAP earnings of $0.59 per share, up 36% from last year. We delivered $32 million of non-GAAP net income, up 42% from last year and non-GAAP EPS of $0.99 per share, an increase of 45% from the same period last year. Our Scores segment was up 27% over the same period last year. Much of this was due to growth in consumer scores but our B2B business is also growing nicely due to higher volumes. Our Applications segment was up 4% over the same period last year and our Tools segment was down 21% due to a one-time favorable settlement last year. It's a strong start to our fiscal year and I'm pleased with the results. Our top line revenue growth of 6% over last year continues our growth trend and I'm pleased to report that recurring revenues were up 12%. As Scores revenue continues to grow, and we expand our cloud-based business, we expect recurring predictable revenues to be a bigger percentage of our total numbers. And as our revenue growth trend continues, we are beginning to see how we can leverage that revenue growth to the bottom line. Last year, I talked about some large implementations that encountered cost overruns. Those overruns had a negative impact on our margins and masked much of the progress we were making. This quarter, by contrast, we drove 6% revenue growth, much of which is very high margin revenue. Because of this, and our focus on cost controls, we were able to increase our non-GAAP operating margin by 600 basis points and we were able to super-size that leverage by our ongoing program of share repurchases. At the same time, we remain focused on driving growth. As promised, we're shifting resources towards distribution. While our overall head count is down 22 from last quarter, our quota-carrying sales force grew by 23 people, to help bring our products to market more quickly and broadly. Our sales force will continue to grow as the year progresses. Bookings this quarter were up 24% over the same period last year and our pipeline looks strong. Demand is growing for advanced analytics that enable better decision making and we are committed to marketing our technology aggressively to capitalize on that emerging opportunity. While these distribution investments are primarily in our Tools and Applications segments, we are also pursuing growth in Scores. We again delivered significant Scores revenue growth. Much of this was on the consumer side where the combination of our Experian partnership and growth from our myFICO business continues to drive our high margin recurring revenue. And we're also growing our B2B business. We're seeing two important trends in Scores B2B. First, we're seeing increased volumes of origination in Scores, as the macro credit market continues to improve. And second, we're seeing significant volume growth in account management scores as customers pull more scores to support their risk management initiatives and customer loyalty programs. Finally, we remain focused on expanding our market share in all areas of our business and we remain disciplined in our investment strategy. I'll share some summary thoughts later. But now I would like to turn the call over to Mike.
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll emphasize three points in my prepared comments. First, we delivered $200 million of revenue; that's an increase of $11 million over last year, primarily driven by high margin recurring revenues. Second, we delivered $19 million of GAAP net income and $32 million of non-GAAP net income, which is an increase of $10 million year-over-year. Finally, we had $36 million of free cash flow this quarter and our trailing 12 month free cash flow number was $146 million. We used $28 million to repurchase shares this quarter and improved our net leverage position. I'll begin by breaking the revenue down into our three reporting segments. Starting with Applications, revenues were $120 million, up 4% versus the same period last year. Much of the increase was driven by our acquisition last year of TONBELLER, a provider of financial crime and compliance solutions. But we also had a strong quarter in fraud solutions, adding two new Falcon customers, and also signed a new Collections and Recovery customer. Our Applications bookings increased 24% from the prior year, with strong growth in transactionally based products. In the Tools segment, revenues were $24 million, down 21% versus the prior year. The decline this quarter was driven by a onetime favorable settlement last year related to underreported royalties on our Blaze Advisor rules product. More important though is our Tools bookings increased 9% from the prior year, adding to our backlog of revenue that will be claimed going forward. And finally in our Scores segment, revenues were $56 million, up 27% from the same period last year. We're continuing to see very positive trends in both parts of our Scores business. On the B2B side, we're up 8% versus the same period a year ago. As Will mentioned, volumes are increasing, particularly in originations and account management, as we've added some new customers and have also seen existing customers increase the frequency of score pulls. The B2C revenues were up 88% from the same quarter last year, as we've now completed a full year since initiating our partnership with Experian. Looking at revenues by region, this quarter 76% of total revenues were derived from the Americas. Our EMEA region generated 17% and the remaining 7% was from Asia-Pacific. Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter represented 74% of total revenue. Consulting and implementation revenues were 17% of total and license revenues were 9% of total revenue. Bookings this quarter were $86 million, up 24% from the prior year quarter. We generated $23 million of current period revenue on those bookings for a yield of 26%. The weighted average term for our bookings was 24 months. Operating expenses totaled $169 million this quarter, compared to $192 million in the prior quarter, which included a $16 million restructuring charge. Adjusting for that charge, operating expenses were still down about $6 million compared to last quarter when we had high cost of revenue associated with certain professional services engagements. We remain focused on managing costs tightly while still investing responsibly in growth. And we expect our OpEx run rate to be approximately $170 million to $175 million over the next few quarters including amortization expense. As you can see in our Reg G schedule, our non-GAAP operating margin was 25% for the first quarter. We expect that operating margin to be between 26% to 28% for the full year. GAAP net income this quarter was $19 million, up 34% from the prior year and non-GAAP net income was $32 million for the quarter, up 42%. The effective tax rate was about 19% this quarter and was positively impacted by a catch-up from the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. As a result, we expect the effective tax rate for the full year to be about 28% to 30%. The free cash flow for the quarter was $36 million compared to a negative $5 million in the prior quarter. For the trailing 12 months, cash flow was $146 million, up 13% from the prior period. Turning to the balance sheet. We had $91 million in cash at the end of the quarter. Our total debt is $619 million with a weighted average interest rate of 4.3%. The ratio of our total net debt to adjusted EBITDA declined this quarter to 2.4 times, below the covenant level of three. During the quarter, we returned $28 million in excess cash to our investors by repurchasing 319,000 shares at an average price of $89.11. We still have nearly 91 million remaining on our latest board authorization and continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. We also continue to actively evaluate opportunities to acquire relevant technologies and products that advance our strategy or strengthen our portfolio and competitive position. And finally, we are reiterating our previously provided guidance for the fiscal year. With that, I'll turn it back over to Will.
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: As I've been saying for several quarters, I believe FICO is in unique position with tremendous prospects. This year, we celebrate 60 years in business. We built the legacy of high quality products that are industry leaders, particularly in financial services. Yet there is increasing demand for our IP from our markets. Our build-out of the Decision Management Suite allow businesses to take the same decision making capabilities that our financial services customers have used for decades and apply cutting-edge analytics to improve their decisions. And our FICO Score continues to demonstrate why it's the industry standard. Among both our existing financial services customers and consumers were increasingly understanding that the FICO Score is indeed the score the matters. I'll turn the call back now to Steve to cover Q&A.
Steven P. Weber - Vice President, Treasurer & Investor Relations: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks and we're ready now to take your questions. Operator, please open the lines.
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is open.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Hi, good evening, gentlemen. My first question was going to be around sort of what you guys were hearing in the economy but I think you sort of answered it with your comments around origination activity. I was hoping if you could give us a little bit more color maybe by the different origination lending areas, like what was driving the growth? Was it broad based? And also when you said the account management score pulls were increasing, just curious, what drove that because it sounded like the pulls in account management were already increasing for quite some time because of just the increased risk management by the banks?
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: Yeah, Manav, what was driving originations this quarter is a lot of what we've seen leading up to this quarter, which is the auto scores that are being pulled for auto sales, along with more credit card pulls, that are starting to appear within the underlying numbers. As it relates to account management, we have been seeing a trend of an increase in scores pulled; in fact, this quarter was one of the largest we've seen in a number of years. And what's been driving that in part is enhanced credit risk management going on within the banks, as well as more and more banks who are rolling out open access programs, are beginning to pull scores more frequently in order to provide that to their customers in the form of a monthly report.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then just stick on Scores, and it seems like obviously everyone is pulling the FICO Score more and more. I was hoping you could provide some of your thoughts on – we've seen in the recent press obviously you've had someone like SoFi take pretty aggressive stabs in the marketing of the FICO Score. And then there's also been some noise around making sure FICO is not mandated to be used, or however you want to phrase it, in the mortgage market? I was hoping we could hear your views on that.
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: Sure. The very short answer to your question is the FICO Score franchise has never been stronger. It's very healthy and what we're seeing is more and more customers coming to FICO, not customers departing from FICO. As you know, in the U.S. we have a 90% share in credit decisioning in situations where scores are used. And what we're seeing is, in the 10% we don't have, we're seeing customers come back rather than departures. I'm glad you raised the question because it's worth commenting on some of these recent articles and the discussion with the alternative lenders. When we put together a FICO Score, our goal is to provide precision credit decisioning with the most predictive power possible across as large a population as we can, an actionable population for our clients. And so the FICO Score that we're all familiar with is designed to do that. It's designed to provide a high level of prediction across a large population. There are always situations where you can take a very narrow population and find some dataset that has high predictive power for a credit decision for a very narrow population. And that's not a problem for FICO, in fact, we do custom scores for our bank clients and we're happy to use all sorts of alternative data in a custom score to provide a more precise decision with respect to a particular population. But when you get into some of these alternative lending situations, you see players who are focused on very narrow populations and so they look at data beyond the tradeline data that we tend to focus on. Now of course we can look beyond that too and we do. And we're always on the lookout for new and different data sources that can score populations that are previously unscored. And so for example, we've launched this FICO Score XD which lets us score on the order of 50 million consumers who were previously unscorable. And that's leveraging utility payment data, telecom payment data, some rental payment data. And although it's not as broad as the tradeline data that we use in the traditional FICO Score, it is predictive and useful for a smaller population that wasn't being picked up before. So where we can do it, we do do it. I think some of the headlines reflect a bit of a desire by some of these alternative lenders to stir up controversy. We're not really seeing it in our numbers. We're not selling fewer Scores. In fact, we sell our Scores to many alternative lenders and those volumes are going up not down.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then just last one. Thank you. That was really helpful. Just the Experian contract looks like it's going pretty well. I just wanted an update, I think last time you had said that you had a few other sort of things in the pipeline with respect to D2C, any updates there for us?
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: We do have things in the pipeline but we don't have updates for you at this time. We continue to have bigger prospects there and we have very strong partnership with Experian but nothing to announce right now.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, fair enough. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good afternoon, everyone.
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: Hi, Bill.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So congratulations on a solid quarter.
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: Thanks.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So one of the themes that seems to be coming across in the number of different segments is new customers and you mentioned that for Falcon. You mentioned it for Collection and Recovery. You mentioned it for B2B. And I was hoping if you could just go to those segments and talk about what is it that suddenly in what's perceived to be a relatively mature market, highly penetrated, you're actually bringing in new customers?
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: Yeah, absolutely. Some of it is increasing capability and additional features around our core offering. Some of it there is some amount of international expansion that's going on. With questions on recovery what started out as being a bit more of a focus on third-party collections has really broadened so that we believe we have the premier offering for both banks and third party. So there's a broadening there and an expansion of our Collections and Recovery franchise. And then B2B Scores, we touched on it earlier. You're seeing some activity that just comes from the economy picking up and more attention to risk management from the banks but also we believe that banks are pulling the scores much more frequently to support their communication of the scores to consumers. And so as they put FICO Scores on to bank statements, they're reaching out for scores on a more frequent basis and sometimes for more accounts than they were pulling before.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. So question for you on DMS. You mentioned that you'd added 23 quota-carrying sales people, what's your total up to now?
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: Our total, Bill, I got to check. Give me a second to check.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. While you're checking – my question is going to be, you were selling previously. It sounded like average sale was running about $0.5 million. You were seeing some of your existing customers come back and buy more. What have been the trends there? Are you adding new customers? Are you able to – are the existing customers coming back and buying more?
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: We're adding new customers and we're seeing existing customers buy more. Although we don't position DMS as a platform when we sell it, and we position it as a solution to a problem, the fact is the way it's architected, we're putting in a lot of platform capability when we sell the very first solution. And so the ability to expand on that, and to broaden the solution and to move into adjacent areas for our customers is pretty high, flexible and fast. And so we are seeing initial DMS sales followed by follow-up sales.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So on the Tools side, what was the size of the one-time royalty settlement? I'm just trying to get at a normalized growth rate for Tools?
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: It was just under $6 million a year ago.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got you. So that was the onetime royalty settlement?
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: Yes, so if you pull that out, you'll get a sense for where we are.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. And what was driving the increase in the transactional and maintenance revenue on a year-over-year basis from 69% to 74%?
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: A lot of it, Bill, was the myFICO Scores and the B2B Scores business, along with the Experian revenue as well as fraud and TRIAD revenue that comes through our channels on a transactional license basis. So it's kind of the big products.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: And I wanted to ask about your – you mentioned potentially using your free cash for repurchases and M&A. I wanted to ask, given the pullback in the share price, what your leanings were now and whether you guys have been out in the market in January.
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: We have been in the market and we continue to view our stock as just a terrific opportunity especially at these levels. And so you can imagine and expect that we'll continue to participate in stock repurchase at these levels in a fairly aggressive way.
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: We are, though, Bill, just as a remainder, blacked out during the period leading up to our call, but beyond that we're in the market.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. Thank you very much.
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: And Bill, just to close off on your first question on sales, at the end of this last week, we have roughly 345 people in all of sales and roughly 190 of them are field sales quota-bearing reps.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Huff from Stephens, Incorporated. Your line is open.
James Rutherford - Stephens, Inc.: Hey, this is James Rutherford in for Brett. Congratulations on the quarter. I just want to ask on Affinity, and I apologize if you talked about this for the first couple of minutes that I was actually absent from the call. But have you guys made any kind of headway in those discussions you've been having with financial institutions on Affinity?
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: Headway, yes, but we have nothing to announce.
James Rutherford - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Are there any expectations in the guidance for the year in terms of Affinity acceleration? I'm trying to get kind of a feel for how your expectations are on that?
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: No. No, we did not build Affinity into our guidance.
James Rutherford - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. And then I wanted to follow-up on Bill's question on Tools, if we take out that settlement benefit last year of $6 million, growth would have been...
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: It was closer to $5 million, it was under $6 million. Just around $5 million.
James Rutherford - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. So growth would have been roughly flat, I think by my math. I just wanted to clarify what the expectations are going to be for the remainder of the year? I assume we're still expecting growth but kind of what's going to drive that change?
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: Yeah. So James, we built into our guidance, which is the number we reconfirmed today, for Tools high single digit, and we still expect to get there through a combination of license deals and any SaaS offerings that we sell through the DMS.
James Rutherford - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. I was actually going to ask about SaaS next. You guys won couple of Falcon deals; that's a nice sign. Were those SaaS, and even if not, can you give us an update on kind of how the sales in the SaaS business are going in general?
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: Yeah. So on the Falcon deals, those were on premise deals with some European customers. So they were not SaaS. They were sold under the classic Falcon model. Though on a SaaS basis, we had another strong quarter. We had almost $8 million of booked deals across a variety of our products, including the Collections and Recovery products and the Debt Manager products, and of course the Adeptra product line which is all SaaS basis.
James Rutherford - Stephens, Inc.: Okay, excellent. And then just a question on Scores, very, very nice growth on the B2C side. I was curious, are you guys breaking out sort of what the growth would have been excluding the Experian contract, just to kind of get a flavor for how to model that once that sort of lapse?
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: Yeah, it lapsed. What we did is we built into our guidance the run rate exiting the year our fourth quarter. That's what we built into the guidance. It essentially lapsed in our quarter ending in June which is when we had almost the first full rollout of all of the Experian subscriber base. And let's see, the other part of your question was do we break that out separately? We don't but I will tell you that our myFICO business grew at very high double-digit rates this quarter compared to last year.
James Rutherford - Stephens, Inc.: Great, okay. I just had one more quick one, if I may. Are there any quarters this year that have a hard licensed comp in Applications or in Tools that might make growth outsized in one direction or another, so we can get an expectation for how that might flow through?
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: Yeah, well our fourth quarter last year the one ending in September was a record quarter where we had I think it was roughly $40 million, $45 million of license revenue. So if there is a tough comp that'd be it.
James Rutherford - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Galinko from Sidoti. Your line is open.
Matthew Galinko - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. My question is, are you actively marketing myFICO at this point, or is it simply benefiting from some of the other promotional activities like Open Access or Experian's efforts?
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: We do actively market it but as you can imagine, we don't have anything like the war chest that our competitor have for marketing their offerings. And so you don't see us on television for example. We're footing the tab for the advertising costs but we do market it. It's not a hobby, it's a business.
Matthew Galinko - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Sure, fair enough. And in terms of your goals on hiring out the quota-carrying sales force, how far along are you in that process? Are you still looking to hire? Are you satisfied with the pace that you've been able to bring people on board to push your Applications strategy?
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: We're not quite satisfied with the pace and we are pushing to hire and we'll continue to hire. What's happened is we're getting traction with the products and the services. We've got this terrific offering. And we're really in the mode now hiring – hiring confidence sales people to sell this kind of stuff as quickly as we can and we still have openings.
Matthew Galinko - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Got you. All right. That's all for me. Thank you.
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: Thanks, Matt.
Operator: We have no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to the presenters.
William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: Thank you. This concludes today's call. We'd like to thank you all for joining.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2015 Q4  (2015-11-05 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Steven P. Weber - Treasurer, VP & Investor Relations Officer William J. Lansing - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations
Analysts: William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Courtney and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fair Isaac Corporation's Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. Thank you. Mr. Weber, you may begin your conference.
Steven P. Weber - Treasurer, VP & Investor Relations Officer: Thank you, Courtney. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining FICO's fourth quarter earnings call. I'm Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike Pung. Today we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter, in order to facilitate an understanding of the run-rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular in the risk factors and forward-looking statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website, or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through November 5, 2016. Now I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
William J. Lansing - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks Steve, and thank you everyone for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. I'll briefly summarize our financial results for the quarter and full fiscal year and then talk about the progress we made this fiscal year on our strategic initiatives. Finally, I'll discuss our outlook for 2016. In our fourth quarter, we reported revenues of $233 million, the largest ever in company history and an increase of 5% over the same period last year. We delivered $33 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $1.03 per share, which included restructuring and tax adjustments which Mike will walk through. We delivered $51 million of non-GAAP net income, up 15% from last year and non-GAAP EPS of $1.57 per share, an increase of 18% from the same period last year. It's another great finish to a fiscal year. Our full year revenue growth of 6% beat our guidance. And adjusting for the restructuring and tax benefit, we were within the guided range for net income and EPS. Our Applications business was up 2% for the quarter and 4% for the full year over last year. We are encouraged by the reception for the cloud-based versions of our applications. In fact, our cloud-based products overall were up 13% in fiscal 2015, much of which was due to growth in cloud applications. Our Tools segment was down 9% versus the same quarter last year due to lighter license sales this quarter, but was up 7% for the full year. More importantly, recurring revenue in our Tools segment was up 19% in fiscal year 2015 versus the prior year. As more of this business is sold in the cloud, we will see recurring revenues grow, resulting in a more predictable business model. Finally, our Scores business was up 24% this quarter versus the prior year quarter and 11% for the full year versus the prior year. Much of this was on the consumer side, where full year revenues were up 45% over the prior year. But we also continue to see positive trends on the B2B side as credit markets continue to thaw. I'd like to take a step back and focus on a few of the initiatives we've been working on in fiscal year 2015 and explain why I'm so excited about our prospects. Our Decision Management Suite, DMS as we call it, is set to build on the momentum of 2015. We added 25 new customer logos during the year. Furthermore, all existing Decision Management platform customers have contracted for additional projects, resulting in repeat business from each and every customer. Hundreds of new opportunities have been added to the pipeline and we are winning a significant number of the deals. Additionally, we're winning in less than 90 days with an average of $500,000 per opportunity, rate and pace that fortify the confidence we have in our DMS strategy. Given the strength of our product portfolio, our theme for 2016 is to focus on expanding distribution, which will contribute to accelerating growth. We'll be adding more sales people to supplement those already added in 2015 and our sales team under the strong leadership of Wayne Huyard is focused on execution and boosting productivity. During 2015, Wayne built a strong leadership team that is now focusing on identifying key stakeholders, buyers and influencers. They're zeroing in on places where our decisioning technology is most valuable and communicating FICO's unique ability to provide that value. Supported by field marketing, our sales team will target new logos and continue to expand the portion of our business coming from beyond financial services. On the Scores side, we delivered strong growth in fiscal 2015 and we have several more growth initiatives on the way. We continued to make huge strides with our Open Access program. Just last month, we announced that we had crossed a new milestone. 100 million consumer accounts now have regular access to FICO Scores for free. And we'll be adding many more in 2016. This program has proven beneficial for both consumers and lenders. Lenders have reported that consumers viewing their FICO score demonstrate higher engagement, more visits to bank websites, lower attrition, lower delinquencies, and higher FICO scores. In fact, in a new report published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's Payments Cards Center, based on data from the Barclaycard participation, some of those benefits were outlined. 84% of enrolled cardholders check their FICO scores every month. Credit card utilization by the riskiest cardholders generally declines after they enroll in the program and delinquency rates of the people enrolled in the program remain below those of their non-participating peers for up to nine months after enrollment. While the program has raised consumer understanding and awareness of FICO scores, many consumers remain confused about the various credit scores provided to consumers by others. A recent study found that a majority of consumers, 62%, who have received non-FICO credit scores online believe they have in fact received actual FICO scores. Further, 82% think these non-FICO credit scores are also widely used by lenders. Formulas used by others to create credit scores for the same consumers that are often significantly different from their FICO scores, sometimes 100 points or more. Consumers who know their actual FICO scores have an accurate understanding of how lenders will evaluate them when they apply for a loan. We will continue to work for consumer credit education and transparency. Overtime, we expect that consumer awareness about FICO scores will reduce confusion. Marketers selling non-FICO credit scores will be unable to leave their customers with the impression that they're receiving FICO scores when they are not. This transparency and brand awareness will also help us as we move forward to pursue other opportunities in the consumer space. We're currently pursuing innovative ways to further grow our business in the consumer space including through partners. The Affinity market is one we've spoken about in the past and we continue to expect to participate significantly in this market. While we don't have any revenue expectations built into our 2016 numbers, due to uncertainties around timing we do expect to be making announcements in this space in the coming months. We also announced this year, a pilot of our new alternative data score called FICO Score XD. This product is a great example of how we leverage our technology and expertise to support our banking clients by bringing new products to market. This new FICO Score is focused on expanding access to credit, not simply scoring more people. We've created a way to provide a FICO Score for millions of additional consumers, many of them credit worthy. Based on the results of the pilot program the new FICO Score XD can be a lifeline for millions of previously unscorable people. Validations of actual applications show better than expected results. We can score nearly 60% of in the door applications. We expect the FICO Score XD will be available for commercial use in fiscal 2016. Looking ahead to 2016, we continue to invest in areas of our business where we see the greatest growth potential. As we said last quarter, 2015 has been a year of significant product innovation and 2016 will be a year where we expand our distribution to leverage that innovation. Obviously, it's not either or, we will continue to build innovative products. That said we see significant opportunities in the market today for expanding distribution for the products and capabilities available for their customers today. As always, we're diligent in how we just deploy our strong cash flow. We made one acquisition in fiscal 2015 TONBELLER, which gave us critical risk-based financial crime prevention and compliance capabilities that we expect will be increasingly important to our clients. And we continued our stock repurchases. In fiscal 2015, we repurchased 1.7 million shares and in the last five years, we've repurchased nearly 16 million shares. We are strong believers in our own prospects, and view investing and repurchases as an excellence use for the cash we generate. In short, we are very excited about our future. There may be bumps in the road as we continue to experience quarterly lumpiness due to uneven license sales. And it's difficult to determine the timing of revenues from many of our new initiatives. But we are in a unique position in the marketplace on both the Analytic side and the Scores side, we have products and capabilities that the world needs, and those needs are growing. It's up to us to execute on our plans to serve those needs and expand our scope and I'm confident we have the team in place to succeed. I will talk more about our outlook for 2016, but first I will turn the call over to Mike for further financial details.
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: Thanks Will. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I'll emphasize three points in my prepared comments. First, we delivered $233 million of revenue this quarter, up 5% versus last year and a total of $839 million for the year, up 6% from the prior year. Our fourth quarter included $43 million in license revenue. Second, we delivered $33 million in net income this quarter, which included restructuring expenses net of tax of $11.5 million and a reduction to tax expense of $5.4 million. Finally, we delivered $39 million of free cash flow in the quarter, which we used to pay down our revolver. We repurchased 1.7 million shares during the year or 5% of our outstanding shares. I'll begin by breaking the revenue down into our three reporting segments. Starting with Applications, revenues were $149 million, up 17% from last quarter and 2% from the same period last year. The increase over the prior year was primarily driven by increases in Customer Communication Solutions, Collections and Recovery Solutions, and revenues from the TONBELLER acquisition and included a large license renewal. Full year revenues for Applications was $526 million, up 4% from last year. In the Tools segment, revenues were $26 million, flat with last quarter and down 9% from the prior year. The year-over-year decline was due to fewer Blaze and Decision Optimizer license sales this quarter. Full year Tools revenue were $106 million, up 7% from last year. And finally, in our Scores segment, revenues were $57 million, up 3% from last quarter and 24% from the same period last year. B2B was up 5% over the prior period, driven by strong originations and B2C revenues were up 86% from the same quarter last year. For the full year, Scores revenues were $207 million, up 11% from last year. Looking at our revenues by region, this quarter 65% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region. Our EMEA region generated 27% and the remaining 8% was from Asia Pacific. Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter represented 64% of total revenue. Consulting and implementation revenues were 18% of total and license revenues were 18% of total revenue. We generated $23 million of current period revenue on bookings of $105 million, a 21% yield. The weighted average term for our bookings was 18 months this quarter. For the full year, bookings were $315 million, down 13% from the prior year. Our operating expenses totaled $192 million this quarter, up $19 million from the prior quarter. This quarter included a $16 million restructuring charge, which was driven primarily from the write-down of several facilities, as well as the reduction of some head count that will be redeployed to distribution roles. As you can see in our Reg G schedule, non-GAAP operating margin was 32% for the quarter and 26% for the year. We expect that non-GAAP operating margin will be between 26% to 28% in 2016. GAAP net income this quarter was $33 million, down 9% from the prior year due to this quarter's restructuring charge of $11.5 million which is net of tax or $0.35 per share. In addition, we had a positive tax adjustment of $5.4 million or $0.17 per share. Our non-GAAP net income was $51 million for the quarter, up 15% from the same quarter last year. The effective tax rate for the full year was 21%, below our previous guidance, due to the favorable tax resolution of a state tax audit and an increase in earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. We expect the effective tax rate to be between 29% to 30% for the full year of fiscal 2016. Free cash flow for the quarter was $39 million compared to $65 million in the prior year. For the full year, free cash flow was $105 million compared to $160 million in the prior year. Moving on to the balance sheet, we had $86 million in cash at the end of the quarter, which is up $2 million from last quarter due to the cash we generated from operations, partially offset by the payments on the revolver. Our total debt is $608 million with a weighted average interest rate of 4.3%. The ratio of our total net debt to adjusted EBITDA is 2.5 times, below the covenant level of 3 times. We did not repurchase any shares in the fourth quarter, but we bought back 226,000 shares in October at an average price of $88.41. In fiscal 2015, we repurchased a total of $1.7 million shares at an average price of $76.39 for a total of $131 million. We still have $99 million remaining on the latest board authorization and continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. We also continue to actively evaluate opportunities to acquire relevant technologies and products that advance our strategy or strengthen our portfolio and competitive position. With that, I'll turn it back over to Will for his thoughts on 2016.
William J. Lansing - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Mike. As I said in my opening remarks, 2015 was a pivotal year for us. We made significant strides in improving our products and capabilities, and expanding the delivery options. Our applications are now available to customers to either run on premise or access from the cloud. And we now offer customers through our Decision Management Suite, an easy way to evaluate, customize, deploy, and scale state-of-the-art analytics and decision management solutions. Finally, we found new ways to leverage our Scores assets, and we'll continue to expand usage of the industry standard FICO Score among consumers. We've laid the foundation and are confident we have multiple paths to grow in our future. The difficulty is predicting the timing of these initiatives, in the near-term we do still face some uncertainty in the marketplace. Many of our financial services customers are working in a difficult interest rate and regulatory environment and in some cases its effecting our sales cycle, and lower bookings in 2015 caused some headwind as we head into 2016. With all this in mind, we're providing the following guidance for fiscal 2016. We're guiding revenues between $860 million and $870 million, an increase of about 3% to 4% versus fiscal 2015. We're guiding GAAP net income between $94 million and $98 million. GAAP earnings per share between $2.89 and $3.02. Non-GAAP net income between $144 million and $148 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.43 to $4.55. The EPS guidance assumes current share counts although as Mike said, we continue to view repurchases as an attractive use of our cash. I'll now turn the call back to Steve for Q&A.
Steven P. Weber - Treasurer, VP & Investor Relations Officer: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks and we're ready now to take your questions. Courtney, please open the line.
Operator: And our first question comes from Bill Warmington.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good evening, everyone.
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: Hey Bill.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Congratulations on a strong finish to the year.
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: Thank you.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So I wanted to start off by asking about the build out of the sales force for this past year and next year, if you could just talk a little bit about how many sales people were actually added in 2015? How many you plan to add in 2016?
William J. Lansing - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Bill, I'll give you the actual numbers. So, we started to shift internal dollars that we were spending primarily in development into our distribution channels in around the third and the fourth quarter. So for the last quarter and a half, we probably added about 30 people and onboarded 30 sales people and in the meantime we have reduced our head count in other areas by just over 100. We expect between now and the next month or two to probably add at least another 30 to 40 people in the sales capacity and all-in we're expecting to bring our sales team up by roughly 60 people, most of which are hired from the outside, but some we actually have redeployed from areas like product management into our sales force. So to some degree, we are reshifting already existing spend as opposed to adding new spend to the organization.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And then, if you could talk about the – you mentioned the Affinity market being a source of potential opportunity for you. Could you talk a little bit about the pipeline that you see in terms of the number of transactions that you're considering participating in, what types of industries they're in and then maybe even talk about what such a potential deal might look like?
William J. Lansing - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, so we have a – we're in conversations with probably half a dozen potential Affinity customers and we're looking at it in a couple of ways one is directly where we would be, for lack of a better word, the general contractor, and also in other situations where we provide the FICO Score to a partner participating in that space, who would serve the bank or the retailer or whoever it is providing the Affinity services to their customers. And that is kind of the range it's, it is very typically banks, it's retailers, it's anyone who has a large customer base that are good candidates for credit report monitoring services. In terms of the timing, these things take a long time to negotiate and they take quite awhile also measured in quite a few months to turn on, to implement and turn on, and so although we have conversations that are quite far along right now, it's not clear that the revenue will flow in 2016, we'll just have to see how that plays out.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. And then I wanted to ask the top line guidance, it looks like it's about roughly 2.5% to 3.5% times. If you could talk a little bit about the growth assumptions within each of the three segments, Applications, Scores and Tools?
William J. Lansing - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. I think that we expect continued growth in Scores, strong growth in Scores. We expect continued strong growth in Tools, although as some of that shifts to cloud and recurring revenue, it may not appear quite as strong in the revenue as it has historically when it was license sales. So we are a seeing a shift from Tools being predominantly license to being more of a mix with SaaS and our DMS offering. And then Applications is clearly the slowest growing of our major business segments. I do think it's probably worth pausing on this for a moment and talking a little bit more about the relationship between Tools and Applications. The fact is that the IP that underlies our Applications, and the IP that underlies our Tools is the same IP. And we solve the same kinds of problems, whether it's originations or questions on a recovery or any other kind of decisioning. And at some level, the way we've gotten to where we are is Tools were a more flexible and a more custom solution. And when there were enough customers who had the same kind of a problem, we would build an application, which was kind of a somewhat standardized solution for a group of customers sharing the same kind of a problem. And so, the distinction between Tools and Applications is a little bit of a fuzzy one because you can use either Tools or Applications to address the same problem. What we're seeing today is much more fuzziness between the two. Our sales people are not compensated to sell one over the other. We are really focused on selling the right solution to the customer, whatever that may be. And as Tools have become more easy to use, as our DMS suite has developed more functionality, more features, it's become more of an alternative to some of our applications and I think what we're seeing is in certain situations, customers opt for a Tools solution where they might previously have opted for an Applications solution. So, this is a case of some amount of cannibalization of our Applications business by our Tools business and it's not a bad thing. You have to look at it holistically and look at the two on a combined basis to have an accurate picture of how our business is doing.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: Okay. And your next question comes from Manav Patnaik.
Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Good evening, guys. So, just on the revenue growth and I guess the margins, we're still in this low single-digit range in revenue growth. Margins still look like they'll be flattish. And I guess you've talked about your long-term targets for quite some time now to do well beyond that. So, I was just wondering in the context of that, like when is that breakout year in your view, where we start getting close to those ambitions?
William J. Lansing - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Manav, I think that is a very fair question, and I think that 2016 is on our way to a breakout year in 2017. I think that the only reason you see the caution that you see today, is we really do have uncertainty about when some of the stuff hits, but I don't think it's three to five years out. I think it's in the next couple of years. And so, what doesn't happen towards the end of 2016, I think we will start to see happening in 2017. We fully expect that 2017 will be a year of stronger revenue growth and expanding margins.
Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then in the context of this quarter probably being the first full quarter ramp of the Experian deal, we were hoping you guys could provide a little bit more color on what the baked-in assumptions are for Scores and maybe that segment in 2016 to try and sort of gauge what the moving parts really are?
William J. Lansing - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So, Manav embedded in the guidance that we provided for Scores is high-single digit growth. And what we did not try to bake in to the guidance for Scores is any incremental revenue that would run through the Experian channel as we have it today, the direct-to-consumer channel beyond the run rate that we are starting the year with. There are other opportunities and other products that could get added along the way if Experian chooses to do that, and if the customer demand exists for it, and that could provide something beyond what we have built in to our guidance. And as Will mentioned in his comments the Affinity programs and any revenue that could come through a partner like Experian or directly through the customer has not been built into any of the guidance as it also is quite uncertain as to when a customer is ready to launch a program like that. I guess I'd lastly say that we also very purposefully have left to the side the alternative Score XD and not included any of that in our plan for fiscal 2016, though from the latest feedback we've gotten from the test group there is certainly is a high degree of interest to bring that into their credit risk management processes. And those things also take a little bit of time and so in order to be prudent we thought we would hold that off to the side and see that how that plays out. So we think there is some upside opportunities along the way in our Scores business that provide some of the tailwind if you will that may offset some of the headwind we saw this year in our software businesses and the late bookings.
Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then just one more from me, so just on the Tools side obviously, historically you've shown it and you've always guided to sort of low double-digit growth. It seems like I guess momentum didn't carry on in the last quarter here, but should we still see low double-digit in 2016?
William J. Lansing - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, inherent in our guidance is much higher growth in Tools along with high single-digit in Scores and then relatively low single-digit in the biggest part of our business, Applications.
Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And on that Applications, would it be fair to say that if it's conservative it's because you just don't know when those license deals hit?
William J. Lansing - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's very true with Applications. We also have some tough comps in the Fraud area where the last two years we've had some pretty large Fraud revenue quarters because of the timing of license revenue. And so with that being harder to predict , we think you blend it all together and this is a reasonable range to operate from and set our cost structure around.
Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. All right. Thanks guys.
Operator: The next question comes from Brett Huff.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. One thing that looked really good in the quarter was the bookings, they really turned around. Is that just a typical seasonality or was there some things in the works that finally came through or is there any color there that you can give us and then may be anything, any thoughts as you move into 2016?
William J. Lansing - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. There was no real seasonality in it. it was more some things that have been in the works for a while that finally came through. The bright spot embedded within the bookings numbers, the $105 million of bookings is that a larger percentage of those bookings than we've seen in recent quarters relates to transactional volume revenue and so that's part of the recurring revenue stream that, once they go live we'll start seeing that revenue quarter-after-quarter. There's a less of beginning an end point if you will like there is in License and Services. So, not only was it a larger number I would say from my perspective the quality of those bookings were better than we've seen certainly over the last few quarters.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: That's helpful. And then, on the Affinity you were talking about I just want to make sure, did you – have you signed any of the Affinity programs to the new FICO Scores, either directly or through partners or are these the ones that are still in discussion?
William J. Lansing - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, these are still in discussion.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. And then last question from me is given the success of the Experian reseller agreement or partnership, how do we feel about the other credit bureaus or even other ways to distribute that that FICO Score not the Open Access, but through another similar credit bureau or other similar partner?
William J. Lansing - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You know, we continue to look for other ways to take the FICO Score to market. I'm not in a position to comment on the specifics of our discussions with credit bureaus, with the other credit bureaus. But we're always interested in expanding the use of FICO Scores.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. That's exactly, and thank you for your help.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time.
William J. Lansing - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. This concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining.
Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Investor Relations: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2015 Q3  (2015-07-29 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Steve Weber - Vice President, Investor Relations Will Lansing - Chief Executive Officer Mike Pung - Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: Greg Bardi - Barclays Bill Warmington - Wells Fargo James Rutherford - Stephens Inc.
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Latvia and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fair Isaac’s Third Quarter Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Steve Weber, you may begin your conference.
Steve Weber: Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining today’s FICO’s third quarter earnings call. I am Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I am joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing and our CFO, Mike Pung. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run-rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation maybe characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements may involve uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company’s filings with the SEC, in particular in the risk factors and forward-looking statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company’s earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company’s website at fico.com or on the SEC’s website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through July 29, 2016. And with that, I will turn the call over to Will Lansing.
Will Lansing: Thanks, Steve and thank you everyone for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. Today, I will brief you on our financial results for this quarter and how we are doing year-to-date. Then I will take a step back and reiterate our strategy overall and in each operating segment and how we are doing executing against that strategy. In our third quarter, we reported revenues of $209 million, an increase of 6% over the same period last year. Year-to-date, revenues were up 7%. This quarter, we delivered $20 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $0.62 per share. We delivered $32 million of non-GAAP net income, up 10% from last year. During the past year, we brought down our diluted shares from 35 million to 32 million, accelerating our non-GAAP EPS to $1 per share, an increase of 20% from the same period last year. Our applications revenues were down 2% over the same period last year due to lighter license sales this quarter. The segment has performed well this year, up 5% year-to-date. Our tools segment was up 18% over last year, driven primarily by increases in both recurring and license revenues. Growth has been steady in the tools segment and year-to-date tools revenues are up 14% over last year. Our scores segment continues to do very well. Total scores revenue was up 23% compared to last year. Our B2C business was up 73% and our B2B business was up 5% versus last year. Year-to-date, the scores business is up 7%. As we move through our fourth fiscal quarter, it’s a good time to review our strategy and our success in executing on that strategy. In our applications segment, we have invested heavily in order to increase the addressable market for our market-leading analytic applications. We have made available cloud-based versions of our solutions. We have built out additional functionality in our products and we have acquired additional capabilities through a number of acquisitions. In some cases, we have strengthened the motor under our market leading products. In fast-moving markets like fraud prevention, our acquisitions of Infoglide with its identity resolution engine and of TONBELLER with its financial crime and compliance technology have enabled us to offer a much broader, more responsive fraud prevention solution to our customers. We have improved our strong offerings in the customer account management, originations and collections in recovery spaces and have expanded the addressable markets by offering cloud-based versions of them. We believe that over time these investments will drive growth that we couldn’t achieve by simply selling to customers buying on-premise solutions. With a strong portfolio of products now in place, we are shifting our focus to distribution. In fact, this quarter, we had a small restructuring charge as we moved some expenses from building our products to distributing those products. We are working on refining our distribution and go-to-market for both the applications and tools segments. This includes significant sales training and increasing sales resources to reach new market segments. We are confident about our prospects, but also understand that our banking clients are operating in the constrained environment. So, even as our ability to compete and win is growing, it remains difficult to predict the timing of individual deals. In our tools business, we have also been working on ways to expand distribution to a much larger market. The challenge is similar to the one we faced in the applications business, but the approach is different. Essentially, we are actively pursuing ways to get our best-of-breed products into the hands of the disparate markets and disparate industries that are looking to use analytics to extract value from data. Furthermore, we are growing recurring revenue in our tools business as over time, we had more subscription-based cloud revenue. In our scores segment, we are beginning to realize the results of our strategic initiatives. The $56 million of revenue this quarter was the highest since Q4 of 2007. As we look ahead, we see opportunities to continue to grow. In B2B scores, we are seeing increased volumes, including another quarter of growth in origination activity. As this score used by lenders, we are well-positioned to benefit from a macro expansion of consumer lending. And our consumer scores business continues to deliver outstanding growth. In fact, this quarter that business is up 73% over last year. We are driving growth at myfico.com as consumers continue to receive a premium value in our FICO score-based products and services, including access to the most widely used FICO score versions across all three bureaus. And our partnership with Experian delivers a premier financial monitoring product, where Experian provides the FICO score with their data. Consumers are beginning to understand that the FICO score is the store that lenders use, and therefore, the score they need to know. We continue our efforts to educate and inform consumers with the expectation that they will ultimately choose products that include the same analytic used by the overwhelming majority of financial institutions, the FICO score. As we review our strategies, investments and results, we continue to carefully evaluate uses of cash. In our third quarter, we repurchased 327,000 shares. So far this fiscal year, we have repurchased around 1.7 million shares. As I said before, we are committed to a core strategic business model, focused on growth and profitability while giving shareholders an even greater return by reducing shares outstanding. I will share some final thoughts later, but now I will turn the call over to Mike for further financial details.
Mike Pung: Thinks, Will. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will emphasize three points in my comments. First, we delivered $209 million of revenue, up 6% from the same period last year. This quarter includes a 23% increase in scores segment and an 18% increase in tools. While our applications segment was down slightly, this segment is up 5% year-to-date. Second, we delivered $20 million in net income, which included restructuring and acquisition-related expenses of $2.3 million. While we continue to invest heavily in our growth initiatives, our emphasis is shifting from new product releases to refining our distribution capabilities. Finally, we delivered $34 million of free cash flow and repurchased 327,000 shares during the quarter. I will begin by breaking the revenue down into our three reporting segments. Starting with applications, revenues were $127 million, down 2% versus the same period last year due to lighter license sales this quarter in our marketing solutions and fraud management products. This was offset somewhat by our acquisition of TONBELLER. Year-to-date, our applications revenue are up 5% versus the same period last year. In the tools segment, revenues were $26 million, up 18% versus the prior year. The growth this quarter was driven by our rules and models products and our data management platform. Year-to-date, tools revenues are up 14%. And finally, in our scores segment, revenues were $56 million, up 23% from the same period last year. B2B was up 5% driven by another strong originations quarter and B2C revenues were up 73% from the same quarter last year. Revenue increase this quarter had a double-digit rate on myfico.com and our Experian partnership continues to evolve with virtually all their subscribers now receiving a FICO score as part of their bundled offering. Looking at our revenue by region, this quarter, 74% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region; our EMEA region generated 18%; and the remaining 8% was from Asia-Pacific. Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter represented 69% of total revenues. Consulting and implementation revenues were 18% of total and license revenues were 13% of total revenue. We generated $16 million of current period revenues on bookings of $60 million, a 27% yield. The weighted average term for our bookings was 21 months this quarter. Year-to-date, our bookings are pacing below our expectations, which is important as bookings generate future revenue. Our operating expenses totaled $172 million this quarter, down slightly from the prior quarter. This was higher than the amount we got in last quarter due to the $2.3 million charge for restructuring and acquisition related expenses. The restructuring expense resulted from moving resources to distribution roles. As you can see in our Reg G schedule, non-GAAP operating margin was 26% for the quarter. We expect the full year that operating margins will be between 25% and 27%. GAAP net income this quarter was $20 million, down 3% from the prior year. Non-GAAP net income was $32 million for the quarter or up 10% from the same quarter last year. The effective tax rate was about 35% this quarter, higher than previous quarters due to higher U.S. based profits. And it’s 29% year-to-date, which approximates where we expect the effective tax rate to be for the full year 2015. Free cash flow for the quarter was $34 million compared to $25 million in the prior year. Now moving on to the balance sheet, we had $84 million in cash at the end of the quarter. This is down $2 million from last quarter due to repurchases of shares and some debt reduction, partially offset by cash generated from operations. Our total debt is $648 million with a weighted average interest rate of 4.2%. The ratio of our total net debt to adjusted EBITDA is 2.7 times, below the covenant level of 3 times. During the quarter, we returned $30 million in cash to our investors by repurchasing 327,000 shares at an average price of $91.72. We still have remaining $119 million on the latest Board authorization and continue to do share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. We also continue to actively evaluate opportunities to acquire relevant technologies and products that advance our strategy or strengthen our portfolio and competitive position. And finally, we are reiterating our previously provided guidance for the fiscal year. This implies quarter four revenues of between $224 million to $229 million and net income of $39 million to $42 million. This requires us to close at least $35 million of license revenue in quarter four compared to the record $46 million we delivered in quarter four of last year. We have several large deals and a strong pipeline of mid-sized opportunities in our pipeline for quarter four that supports our current forecast. With that, I will turn it back over to Will for some final comments.
Will Lansing: Thanks Mike. With less than one quarter to go in our fiscal year, I am pleased with our progress towards our targets for the year. More importantly, I am pleased with how the company is positioned to deliver value to our shareholders now and in the future. We laid our first strategies through our business. For our software assets, we have invested to maintain our deeply embedded market leadership and to expand our IP assets under broader markets. We are beginning to see results, but there is much more yet to come. On the scores side we are just now seeing how we can take a brand that is so strong in financial services and create substantial value among consumers. Even as we operate in markets with significant stress and turbulence, I believe we have never been better positioned to make the most of our significant opportunities. We will have much more to say next quarter as we talk about our expectations for fiscal 2016. Rest assured we will remain focused on execution. And while 2015 was the year of innovation, 2016 will be a year where we expand our distribution to leverage that innovation. And all that we do will be with an eye towards providing value to our shareholders. I will now turn the call back over to Steve for Q&A.
Steve Weber: Thanks Will. This concludes our prepared remarks and we are ready now to take any questions. Operator, please open the line.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
Greg Bardi: Hi, this is actually Greg calling on for Manav. Just wanted to ask about myfico.com, nice to hear that it’s growing double-digits, I think that might be a step up from at least, anecdotally, what you were saying last quarter, just wondering what’s driving the strong growth there and what you are seeing, at least in the direct channel?
Will Lansing: Well, in the direct channel, we are seeing a lot of volume coming through along with some of the enhanced packaging that we put together last year. We took and added several products, including identity theft product last year and we are seeing the benefits of that increased volume against the higher price point.
Greg Bardi: Okay, that makes sense. And then also just wanted to ask about the – you talked about the distribution for both applications and tools, when we think about the cost base, is that a shifting of costs from product development into that sales or are we going to see a step up from the added distribution?
Will Lansing: I would say that you are going to see a little bit of both. So what we have is a situation where over the last several years, we have invested extremely heavily in our product portfolio both through organic development and also through acquisitions. And we are now in the fortunate position having a really robust set of products and services to offer. And our distribution doesn’t match the breadth of our product portfolio. We – I suppose I am not alone as CEO of a software company who feels like you can never have enough distribution for great product. But it is really very much the case with our company that our product portfolio exceeds the coverage that we have and the ability to distribute it. So we are taking some resource from the products side and shifting it in the direction of distribution – sales and distribution. And we will also be increasing the expenses associated with sales and distribution because we think it represents a pretty big opportunity.
Greg Bardi: Okay. And then maybe one more sort of on the same line, just an update on the integration of TONBELLER and where you are in the process of taking that outside of its core markets to some of the other European markets?
Will Lansing: It’s very smooth. The integration is very smooth. We have retained all the personnel. We are really thrilled with the management team there. The growth is still being driven primarily and probably will for the foreseeable future, will be driven primarily by the TONBELLER’s sales and distribution arm selling their products. But we are starting to take it out to the FICO parent side of the house.
Greg Bardi: Okay. Thanks guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.
Bill Warmington: Good afternoon, everyone.
Will Lansing: Hi, Bill.
Bill Warmington: So, I was asked for a little additional color on the bookings numbers. And you saw it in terms of what are the headwinds that you guys faced this quarter that just passed and then also what gives you confidence that you can go ahead and – that you will be able to source new transactions and also, close the ones that are in the pipeline for this coming quarter?
Will Lansing: Great question, Bill. So this is a couple of quarters in a row now where bookings is underperformed at least our internal targets. And as a reminder, bookings represent net new deals that are signed, new revenue associated with it, not standard renewals. Lighter bookings tends to create a headwind because we rely on deals that we signed to generate future revenue for us. And so with a headwind in the bookings numbers that provides or creates a situation where we have to go and get more net new revenue in order to fill that – to meet our objectives and our plans. The environment that we have been operating in, both in the U.S. and at least in the third quarter EMEA, have been what’s driven to the lighter amount of bookings. In other words, we have been dealing with this challenge in North America for some time. In the last quarter, we had a very light quarter in EMEA, which is quite unusual for the team there. And so, we are actively working towards getting some deals closed that we accounted on and planned for certainly within the fiscal year and in a certain case in the third quarter. Some of the work that we are doing to refine the sales organization includes some new blood that we have brought in over the past few months, including leaders in our fraud line of business and in our marketing line of business. And we are using all those efforts to close the gap here for this fiscal year and as we look at next year’s plan.
Greg Bardi: Got it. And then on the scores side of the business, on the B2C side, wanted to ask about what kind of activity you are seeing in the affinity market, that’s been a market that’s really been pretty quiet now for a number of years, what’s going on there and are you guys participating?
Will Lansing: It’s good news. And we are participating, but I would also say it’s going slowly. So what we see is an increase in the number of RFPs out there. We find ourselves on the receiving end of the RFPs and we are definitely a player in the market and considered so by the people we are looking for affinity [ph] channel. I am very confident about our prospects in this space. That said, recognize that these are complex deals that take a long time to put together and they take even longer to implement. So the revenue impact of doing deals in the affinity space will be delayed, but the early signs are extremely promising.
Greg Bardi: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens Inc.
James Rutherford: Hi. This is James Rutherford in for Brett. Thanks for taking the question. Just got a couple here first, on scores, should we expect that kind of strong growth to continue in the fourth quarter and then how should we think about the tough mortgage comps in the fiscal fourth quarter to impact that growth? And then I have one more follow-up after that.
Will Lansing: You can expect the growth to be continually strong in the fourth quarter. We are on a trajectory upward in the third quarter while the best quarter we had in a very long time, it’s not a one-off, its part of a trend and you can follow the dots. It’s a booming business and growing and the fourth quarter should be there in the third. Mortgage is not a big part of the story so I wouldn’t spend a lot of time talking about it.
James Rutherford: Okay. On distribution, the new kind of strategy of shifting spend there, how should we think about the margin impact of those investments, given that I would assume some of the product spend was capital spending versus it sounds like more OpEx, is there an impact to the margin, how should we think about that?
Will Lansing: No, I don’t think you should – I don’t think you should think that there will be a big margin impact, because in fact, our R&D spending expense is not capitalized. So moving the dollars from the product side of the house to the sales of side of the house is not going to have a big margin impact. And these are not dramatic changes that we are talking about. These are measured changes on the margin.
James Rutherford: Got it. Okay. Thanks for the help.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And there are no further questions at this time.
Steve Weber: Okay, thank you very much. Thank you everyone for joining today’s call and for your interest in FICO. This concludes our call. Thanks.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Sherlyn, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fair Isaac Corporation Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed to mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Steve Weber. Please go ahead sir.
Steve Weber: Thank you, Sherlyn. Good afternoon and thank you for joining today's second quarter earnings call. I'm Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike Pung. Today we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the private securities litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular in the Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO Web site or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's Web site at fico.com or on the SEC's Web site at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through April 23, 2016. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
Will Lansing: Thanks Steve and thank you everyone for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. Today, I will briefly summarize our financial results for this quarter, and then I will talk about where we stand half-way through our fiscal year, and why we are so confident about our strategy and our execution of it. In our second quarter, we reported revenues of $207 million, an increase of 12% over the same period last year. We delivered $19 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings at $0.58 per share. We delivered $30 million of non-GAAP net income up 3% from last year and non-GAAP EPS of $0.91 per share an increase of 12% from the same period last year. Our application segment was up 16% over the same period last year. The results included our TONBELLER acquisition, but we also drove growth across our portfolio specifically in fraud solutions, marketing solutions and customer communications solutions. The margins in applications were negatively affected this quarter by a non-recurring charge that Mike will explain in a few minutes. Year-to-date applications revenues are up 10% over the previous year. Our tool segment was up 4% over last year driven primarily by recurring transactional and maintenance increases. Year-to-date tools revenues are up 12% over last year. Our score segment was up 4% compared to last year. Our B2C business was up 24%, our B2B business was down 2% versus last year, but after adjusting out a royalty true-up in the prior period our B2B revenues were up 7% because of our increases in originations. I'm pleased with the revenue growth we are now driving across our business. We believe we can continue and even accelerate that growth while managing our expenses and expanding our margins. We are doing this by carefully executing the strategies we have outlined in each of our segments. In our application segment, we have invested over the past 18 months to deliver cloud-based versions of our solutions. We have had early success selling our originations and collections from recovery product. Just last week, we introduced TRIAD cloud addition. This new offering give smaller and specialty lenders the ability to use advanced customer focused analytics and strategies to increase revenue, share wallet and customer satisfaction. The addition of TONBELLER in January gives us entry into the financial crime and compliance solutions space, and combined with our strong fraud management franchise makes our offerings more valuable to financial institutions as they view risks across their enterprise. In our tools business, we have been working on ways to expand our distribution to a much larger market. In a world that's increasingly looking for ways to extract value through analytics, we have IP and expertise to help make better decisions. When we introduced our decision management suite last year, we put that IP in the cloud and greatly expanded our addressable market. The pipeline analytic cloud now includes all the building blocks needed to build, deploy and manage predictive analytics for growth profitability and competitive advantage. It's beginning to open eyes in the analytics community and while we are still early, we believe we can become a significant growth driver in the years to come. In our score segment, we are now beginning to see the results of the strategic initiatives we have been working on for the last two years. We had a good quarter. In fact, the highest revenue quarter since Q4 of 2008. But more importantly we are positioned to drive significant revenue and earnings growth well into the future. The FICO Score Open Access program continues to expand. This program is good for consumers, good for financial institutions, and addresses consumer confusion between educational scores and FICO scores. This week we announced the expansion of the program to provide FICO scores to approximately 1 million consumers annually who are in need of credit and financial guidance through qualified non-profit credit counselors and participating government entities. In B2B scores, we are beginning to see increased volumes particularly in originations, which will provide a nice tailwind if the trend continues. Finally, our consumers' scores business is on a strong growth trajectory that we believe will continue. We are driving growth at myfico.com. Also this quarter, we have started to see the impact of our partnership with Experian, which has been migrating subscribers to products with the FICO score. That conversion will continue over the next few months and we expect the subscriber base to grow as more and more consumers look to Experian for genuine FICO scores. As I said before, we are particularly pleased to partner with Experian to provide a premier financial monitoring product to American consumers. And we believe that as we continue our efforts to inform consumers, they will ultimately choose products that include the same analytic overwhelmingly used by financial institutions, the FICO score. We are proud of our latest innovations which came out of several different areas of the business. We recently announced the launch of a FICO score based on alternative data to identify creditworthy Americans who are not able to be scored with traditional credit bureau data alone. FICO on partnership with Equifax and LexisNexis Risk Solutions has launched a pilot program with 12 of the largest credit card issuers. The new FICO score has been well-received by the media, consumer advocacy groups, regulators and large and small lenders. This quarter we released an enhancement on myfico.com, which for the first time provides consumers with a 19 most widely used FICO scores. Continuing our efforts to provide an unprecedented level of transparency and help consumers navigate a complex credit environment in which lenders use different versions of the FICO score for different types of lending decisions. Last month, we announced that 11 of China's leading alternative lending companies have signed on to the new FICO alternative lending platform as part of industry-wide efforts to upgrade risk management across China's booming peer-to-peer and micro loan sector. The 11 companies represent an estimated $10 billion in P2P and micro loans. By using the FICO platform, these lenders will be more stable, viable and profitable than ever before. In February, we announced the availability of the FICO data management integration platform as streaming analytics and real-time distributed processing platform that ingests, normalizes, correlates and distills Big Data as it is being generated. The platform collects filters and aggregates batch and streaming data from hundreds of sources and analysis it on the fly providing applications with greater agility and responsiveness to deliver high impact decisions. We also rolled out the FICO Big Data Analyzer, a purpose built analytics environment for a new generation of data professionals. Big Data Analyzer empowers a broad range of users to collaboratively explore data and discover new insights from any type and size of data on Hadoop. Built-on technology acquired from Karmasphere last year, Big Data Analyzer equips teams of business users and analyst and data scientists with access to their organizations new frontier of competitiveness, data and analytics. Finally, shortly before participating in the White House summit on Cyber Security, we announced the availability of the FICO Cyber Security Analytics Solution. This solution leverages decades of research and streaming analytics technologies as well as new advances in self-learning models to detect emerging and evolving cyber threats in real-time. As the leading provider of fraud detection solutions for financial institutions world-wide, we see first hand how today's cyber security breaches becomes tomorrows payment card fraud and account compromise headlines. We have adopted our real-time streaming analytics technologies to provide the unique analytic layer of event detection and monitoring. Our solution can help organizations of all kinds, protect their data assets and stop damaging data breaches and theft attempts in their tracks. These innovations are just the latest examples of ways in which we are unlocking the value of our core IP, developed from decades of analytics research and development to efficiently and effectively meet the burgeoning market demand for better decisions through analytics. At the same time, we continue to carefully evaluate uses of cash, in our second quarter we repurchased 540,000 shares. In April, we repurchased another 327,000 shares bringing our total to around 1.7 million shares repurchased so far this fiscal year. We remain confident in our strategic business model focused on growth and profitability while giving shareholders an even greater return by reducing shares outstanding. I will share some final thoughts later, but now I will turn the call over to Mike for further financial details.
Mike Pung: Thanks Will. Good afternoon everyone. Today I will emphasize three points in my prepared comments. First, we delivered $207 million of revenue up 12% from the same period last year with growth in all three segments. This quarter includes initial revenue generated from our Experian partnership. We expect revenue from this partnership to ramp up as the program is rolled out across the various Experian platforms. Second, we delivered $19 million of net income, which was negatively impacted by a non-recurring pre-tax charge related to a loss contract and the TONBELLER acquisition costs both of which totaled $4 million in the aggregate. Finally, we funded the acquisition of TONBELLER, and also repurchased 540,000 shares in quarter two and another 327,000 shares in April. I will begin by breaking the revenue down into our three reporting segments. Starting with applications, revenues were $134 million up 16% versus the same period last year. This included about $3 million in revenues from our TONBELLER acquisition. The biggest gains came in our fraud and marketing solutions. License revenue was particularly strong at $23 million this quarter more than doubled the prior year. In the tool segment, revenues were $23 million up 4% versus the prior year. The growth this quarter was driven by our optimization products and our data management platform. And finally, in our score segment revenues were $50 million up 4% from the same period last year which included a royalty true-up. Adjusting for that true-up B2B was up about 7% primarily due to increased originations. Sequentially B2B is up 5%. The B2C revenues were up 24% from the same quarter last year and 40% sequentially due to increased sales at myfico.com and to the first revenues from the Experian partnership. We expect B2C revenues will continue to grow this year while Experian converts its existing subscribers to the FICO score and with new subscribers being added through the ongoing marketing efforts. Looking at our revenues by region, this quarter's 73% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region, our EMEA region generated 20% and the remaining 7% was from Asia-Pacific. Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter represented 67% of total revenues consulting and implementation revenues were 18% of total; and license revenues were 15% of total revenue. We generated $24 million of current period revenues on bookings of $80 million up 30% yield. The weighted average term for our bookings was 22 months this quarter. Our operating expenses totaled $173 million this quarter compared to $165 million in the prior quarter or up $8 million. This was higher than the $165 million to $170 million we guided last quarter due to a non-recurring $3.2 million charge from a cost overrun on a large implementation project and about $500,000 in legal and tax charges related to the TONBELLER acquisition. For quarter three and quarter four, we expect our operating expenses to be approximately $170 million per quarter including amortization expense. As you can see in our Reg G schedule, our non-GAAP operating margin was 24% for the quarter, we expect the full year that operating margin will be between 26% to 28%. GAAP net income this quarter was $19 million down 9% from the prior quarter but non-GAAP net income was $30 million for the quarter up 3% from the same quarter last year. The effective tax rate was about 28% this quarter. We expect the effective tax rate to be about 29% to 30% for the full year fiscal 2015 slightly lower than we previously estimated. Free cash flow for the quarter was $37 million compared to $44 million in the prior year. Moving on to the balance sheet, we add $87 million in cash on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. This was down $8 million from last quarter due to the purchase of TONBELLER and repurchases of our shares partially offset by cash generated from operations and draws on our revolving line of credit. Our total debt is $658 million with a weighted average interest rate of 4.6%. The ratio of our total net debt to adjusted EBITDA is 2.8x, which is below the covenant level of 3x. During the quarter we returned $40 million in cash to our investors repurchasing 540,000 shares at an average price of $74.30. Additionally, we repurchased 327,000 shares in April. We still have $119 million remaining on the latest Board authorization and continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of our cash. We also continue to actively evaluate opportunities to acquire relevant technologies and products that advance our strategy, our strength in our portfolio and competitive position. Finally, we are reiterating our previously provided guidance for the fiscal year. With that, I will turn the call back to Will for some final comments.
Will Lansing: Thanks Mike. As I said, last quarter, it's a special time in the history of FICO. After refining our strategy and investing in our future, we are now beginning to see signs of sustainable growth returning to the business. Our score segment is poised to unlock the value that's been built over 25 years of leadership in the financial services system. Our applications remain industry leaders and we have the opportunity to reach new markets by offering these solutions in the cloud. And our decision management suite takes the proven value of IP we built and delivers it to markets that are just now looking to use data to make better decisions. We need to remain focused on execution. We will invest carefully in opportunities for growth and ensure that we deliver a high-quality products and technology on-time. And we will continually look for ways to monetize our IP and expertise and to provide value to our shareholders. I will now turn the call back to Steve for Q&A.
Steve Weber: Thanks Will. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we're ready now to take your questions. Operator, please open the lines.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
GregBardi: Yes. Greg calling on our Manav. So the B2B score looks like it came in pretty strong at the 7% and you talked about some mixed benefits from origination scores. I was wondering if you could just touch on which markets you are seeing that strength whether it would be in a mortgage, credit cards et cetera.
MikePung: Yes. Greg, it was virtually across the board this quarter on the origination side led by cards and followed by mortgage and auto, which were both strong as well.
GregBardi: Okay. And then looking at B2C, I was wondering if you could to the extent that you can help us parse out, how much of that growth is coming from the core myfico versus the Experian deal and even if there is anything coming from the indirect market which you guys have talked about a little bit?
MikePung: Yes. Greg, so we saw growth as we mentioned both across myfico and across Experian coming from the experian.com rollout that happened on December 29. We are not going to break down the numbers further between one or the other, we are just saying that overall we are starting to see some of the acceleration on the consumer side that we have been talking about here since November.
GregBardi: Okay. And the indirect I guess at this point, you guys are attacking that but haven't seen anything flow through to revenues.
MikePung: Yes.
GregBardi: Okay. And then, I guess one more from me just on the kind of under banked FICO score, just wondering, how you guys are thinking about that, is it more of a public goodwill initiative, or is it really something that you think could start to generate revenue and what your strategies there?
Will Lansing: I would say its both. I mean there is a pretty large group of customers that are been found no file and hard to score with traditional bureau data. And in a world where we can start to use the other kinds of data to make these decisions, it makes all the sense in the world to produce scores on it. And we have been working with Equifax and LexisNexis for some time on putting this thing together. We are really pleased with the results. It took a while to bring it to market because we wanted to maintain the integrity of what the score represents. And so we feel pretty good about the decision makers wrapped around these new scores. Is it, do we think we are generating goodwill with that? I hope so. And we are hoping to open up credit markets for the under banked. How bigger market will this be? Time will tell. I think that there is definitely an appetite from lenders to reach these consumers and we will just see how long it takes. But I think there is definitely a business there.
GregBardi: Okay. It makes sense. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.
Bill Warmington: Good afternoon, everyone.
Will Lansing: Hi, Bill.
Bill Warmington: So a question for you on the B2B score side. You did about 11 billion scores last year, if I remember correctly. What's the run rate currently based on this quarter?
Mike Pung: Yes. Bill, the overall volumes are up modestly. They are up higher on originations and a little bit lower on acquisition scores primarily due to a large client or two that have paired back on some of their marketing activities. But overall, we are running up about 3% or 4% in volume wise.
Bill Warmington: Got it. And then the – I wanted to ask about the – on the application side, and the SaaS offerings there. If you will give us a sense for about how much revenue was actually being generated on a SaaS basis, and then also a sense for your success selling into the small and mid-size clients in the U.S., and then also internationally?
Will Lansing: Yes. So I don't have the exact number on the SaaS revenue this quarter, but I will tell you our SaaS business, the revenue that we are claiming is growing at around 5% clip. So mid-single digits. The backlog is growing at a rate slightly faster than that. In terms of kind of market penetration and market acceptance. We are continuing to work pipeline opportunities. We are seeing a lot of larger opportunities as well as smaller market opportunities come across our plate. But it's kind of slow as you go in terms of being able to get those deals in place, get them signed and then obviously convert them over to revenue.
Bill Warmington: Okay. And then jump back to the scores business, on the B2C side, with the Experian implementation on the direct subscribers, I wanted to ask what inning are we in, in terms of that process currently?
Will Lansing: Well, for the quarter we just ended, our quarter two the revenue that is a component of our B2C from Experian came exclusively off of experian.com, which was launched on the 26 of December. Since the end of the quarter, other properties are becoming to convert over. And its – Experian game, they haven't reported any of those crossover numbers subscriber numbers to us yet that reporting will start coming across probably in about a month from now. But just for the knowledge here, we reported the numbers exclusively from experian.com.
Bill Warmington: Got it. Okay. And then, as you look down the road, I know that currently the arrangement is for solely the FICO score, is there – what do you think about the opportunity of being able to sell other products into that subscriber base over time things like the multiple scores that you had mentioned or maybe the score simulator or maybe something else that you are in the process of developing?
Will Lansing: Yes. Bill, I think those are all good examples. We very much have the intension of continuing to enrich the offering to the consumer and those are all good candidates. With the multiple scores we have them up on myfico.com today; I guess that would put us in the forefront of sharing multiple scores with consumers. But, we are certainly willing and happy to have other partners share multiple scores with the consumers and from our standpoint we hope the market goes there. It would be a great thing. In terms of the simulator absolutely that's another natural and we have also talked about consumer card control as a potential offering. So there is a handful of things that are in the works.
Bill Warmington: Got it. And then one housekeeping item, on the buybacks you mentioned the – for the April buyback what was the actual dollar amount on that?
Mike Pung: It was $30 million that was [certainly down] [ph] there, shares we brought back in April.
Bill Warmington: Okay. All right. I will see if anybody up – go back in the queue. Thank you.
Will Lansing: Thanks Bill.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Brett Huff with Stephens Inc.
Brett Huff: Good afternoon.
Will Lansing: Hi, Brett.
Brett Huff: Wanted to ask, a nice work on the apps growth that was obviously a really strong number, can you – I think you mentioned last quarter that you expected some renewals to happen maybe in the back half of the year and you talked sort of how the margin might go up as a result of some of those renewals in the back half, I think is how you described it. Is that still going to happen in the back half is – was the app strength to this quarter related to that or was this something from the pipeline, just kind of give us a sense of kind of what was the nature of the app win this quarter?
Will Lansing: No. We had in terms of the win this quarter, we had one renewal that happened this quarter and then we had several other pretty healthy deals that we signed. That renewal happened in the second quarter and we had anticipated that in our guidance. The renewals we talked about in the back half of the year are still scheduled. And we expect them to come through as a component in the guidance that we have given for the full year.
Brett Huff: Okay. And then question on the B2C direct to consumer agreement with Experian, it sounds like that's potentially really nice channel, what is the pipeline look for you all in terms of other outlooks where other partners you might be able to distribute through or work with in similar nature?
Will Lansing: I can't speak to partnership discussions that are in the works. But, I will say that its our fervent hope that the entire industry adopts FICO scores instead of education scores because as you know FICO scores are the scores that lenders use and so many of the education scores that are being given to consumers are really not being used for credit decisioning purposes. So our goal is to see FICO scores, wherever consumers interested in and how their credit worthiness is being evaluated, we want the FICO score shared with them. And we are exploring all channels to make that happen including the most successful one so far which is Open Access.
Brett Huff: And then last one from me, I think somebody asked this about SaaS before, but and I'm not sure that this question was asked. The percentage of rev that is composed of SaaS products, if we get that number of percentage on – I forgot – I may have just missed that.
Will Lansing: No. I didn't have the number directly in front of me. I said the SaaS revenue was growing about 5% year-over-year that's claimable revenue. In general, I would have to look at up at our SaaS revenue was roughly 20% of our overall total revenue on an annual basis.
Brett Huff: Okay. That's it for me. Thank you.
Will Lansing: That would include hosted and SaaS by the way.
Brett Huff: Oh, hosted and SaaS, okay. Thank you.
Will Lansing: Correct.
Operator: Your next question comes from Matthew Galinko with Sidoti.
Matt Galinko: Hey, thanks for taking my question. I guess – last quarter you talked about TONBELLER acquisition making a sort of the combination making FICO more strategic of vendors for compliance. I'm just curious where you are on technical integrations now around that acquisition and what the timeframe is, that we might see the benefits of becoming more strategic?
Will Lansing: The technology that we acquired with the TONBELLER acquisition is being held in tact. We haven't done a lot of work to try to merge that with our products because it's not necessary. What we are doing is focusing on the sales and distribution piece. And what we have seen is that the way anti-money laundering products are increasingly being bought is in connection with the Chief Risk Officer with a broader view of the risk facing the financial institution. And so we are lining up our TONBELLER capabilities along with our Falcon Fraud capabilities and our Infoglide and so on to bring it to the same decision maker just really on the sales and distribution side more than on the technology integration.
Matt Galinko: Fair enough. And then I guess one other quick one, just curious how if you could talk a little bit more also about the go-to-market plan with the cyber security technology.
Will Lansing: Good question. The interest thing that's going on with the cyber security and how we play in that market is that our – our cyber solutions, which are a directly across our Falcon Fraud capabilities addressed cyber issues in real-time, which is not typical for the industry. And are able to score degree of threaten away that's not typical for the industry, usually the alerts are binary. And so we think we have some fairly distinctive capabilities in cyber. What we do not have is a strong self and distribution built there. And so right now we are working on more of an OEM basis with some of the major players to bring our technology to market along side theirs. A decision for us remains in the future whether it makes any sense to go direct. But right now our plan is to go through partners and channels.
Matt Galinko: Got it. That's helpful. And do you have any kind of timeframe to just think about on when we might start seeing not necessarily meaningful, but any sort of revenue contribution from that.
Will Lansing: Well, I think certainly not before next year.
Matt Galinko: That's great. All right. Thank you.
Operator: Next question is a follow-up question from Brett Huff with Stephens Inc.
Brett Huff: Thanks. Just one quick follow-up, did you guys in your guidance it didn't change I know, have your perceptions, or your assumptions in your guidance changed since last quarter on the piece guidance in revenue that is Experian driven based on kind of the early returns, or is it kind of coming in as you guys expected it and it just kind of take some time to get these conversions done.
Will Lansing: No. It's coming in as we expected. We didn't make any kind of resource all of our guidance based upon the first three months worth of activity from Experian.
Brett Huff: Okay. And then in terms of the after-tax or the charge, I think you said was $4 million, you guys called out, did that end up being where just from how its taxed, is that about a $0.08 hit to the reported numbers is that about, right?
Will Lansing: Yes. It's between $0.08 and $0.09 a share and it related to the two pieces, the contract write-off and then just the cost of the acquisition at TONBELLER.
Brett Huff: And the contract write-off that -- just describe that again for me, I know you mentioned it, but I'm not sure understand kind of what that is?
Will Lansing: Yes. We are working on a large program outside the U.S. with a customer of ours, who are consolidating a number of legacy platforms and systems into a FICO platform. And the complexity of the project is driving some cost overruns and the accounts requires us to take any loss on – any estimated loss on a program like that when we know about it and that's why we booked this quarter.
Brett Huff: Got you. Okay. That's it for me. Thank you.
Will Lansing: You are welcome.
Operator: At this time there are no further questions.
Steve Weber: Thank you. This concludes our call. Thank you all for joining.
Operator: Thank you for your participation. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Mike, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fair Isaac Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Steve Weber. You may begin your conference.
Steven P. Weber: Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining FICO's First Quarter Earnings Call. I'm Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; our CFO Mike Pung; and our Executive Vice President of Scores, Jim Wehmann. Today we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward looking under the private securities litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements include many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular in the Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statement portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through January 29, 2016. Now I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
William J. Lansing: Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. I'll briefly summarize our financial results for this quarter and then I'll discuss some of our strategic initiatives and their expected impact. In our first quarter, we reported revenues of $190 million, an increase of 3% over the same period last year. We delivered $14 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $0.43 per share, down 15% and 8%, respectively, from the prior year. We delivered $23 million of non-GAAP net income, down 14% from last year, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.68 per share, a decrease of 7% from the same period last year.  Our Applications segment was up 3% over the same period last year and our Tools segment was up 19%. Our Scores segment was down 7% compared to last year when we had a large global FICO Score deal. These results were in line with our internal expectations coming off last quarter's record results. We continue to invest in areas where we see the greatest potential with the goal being to drive predictable, sustainable growth. Let me give you a few examples. First, we announced this month that we have acquired TONBELLER, an innovator in risk-based financial crime prevention and compliance. This acquisition combines FICO fraud detection and analytics leadership with TONBELLER's capabilities to address the rapidly growing demand for integrated enterprise-class financial crime and compliance solutions. Now on the face of it, this may appear to be a simple technology tuck-in, giving us better capability in the areas of anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer. In fact, this acquisition is much bigger than that. We believe it will enable FICO to leverage our fraud analytics and risk management expertise to vault ourselves into the increasingly important market for integrated financial crime and compliance solutions, also known in the industry by the acronym FCC. There are a couple of aspects to this market that we find particularly compelling. First, incumbent FCC solutions in the market today are rule-based. With our in acquisition of TONBELLER, we're in a position to offer a risk-based approach, which leading industry experts believe will be required as institutions struggle to anticipate and respond quickly to known and emerging risks across the enterprise. And second, the buyers of this solutions tend to be chief risk and compliance officers. Now many CROs know FICO for our risk management solutions, but they generally view our powerful product solutions as tactical point solutions. By integrating them within a robust FCC offering, FICO will move into a more strategic position within financial institutions, helping chief risk and compliance officers move quickly toward their goal of a common, unified view of the entire risk spectrum. So needless to say, we're very excited about the prospects of this acquisition to help even FICO's value within our customers' businesses. We continue to make progress with some of the innovation we've introduced in our Applications and Tools segments. We signed a new Turkish client for our applications fraud solution and it includes Identity Resolution, a product that we integrated from our Infoglide acquisition. We sold a few deals this quarter where we integrated the InfoCentricity technology that we acquired last year. And we're seeing validation of the Decision Management suite with new customers in banking and retail across North and South America and Europe. We also ran our first competition in partnership with Kaggle. There were 500 participants and more than 2,000 individual entries. More than 130 teams leveraged FICO's technology in their algorithms, and the winning entry was based on FICO's Xpress Optimization technology. This was a great first effort for our Kaggle collaboration. In our Scores business, we announced that the largest private credit reporting agency in Malaysia, CTOS Data, will offer FICO Scores to all its clients beginning in early 2015. The CTOS-FICO consumer credit score will be developed based on FICO's proven score modeling technology. The scoring model for CTOS is created by analyzing the information found in CTOS's comprehensive credit information database. Expanding our valuable FICO Score franchise internationally is an important component of our growth strategy, and agreements like this one in Malaysia represent meaningful progress. In addition, we continue to build momentum with the FICO Score Open Access program. Citi is rolling out the program to its customers right now, and Chase and Ally have committed to do so in 2015. Thanks to our program, American consumers now have a better view of how banks measure their creditworthiness. It's also a win for the banks who are providing valuable information to their customers. We've heard anecdotally that by doing so, they may be reducing their risk. Better informed consumers make better borrowers. Ultimately, this program helps differentiate FICO Scores from the numerous irrelevant scores available in the marketplace that are not used for actual lending decisions. Finally, our partnership with Experian was rolled out at the end of December, making FICO Scores available through Experian's considerable direct-to-consumer channels. As I said last quarter, we're particularly pleased to partner with Experian, a premier provider of financial monitoring products to consumers. The product launched 4 weeks ago, so we don't have results to report yet. But early signs have been positive and we're very excited about the prospects. More broadly, we believe that FICO Score provides substantial value to consumers, just as it does to financial institutions, and consumer credit products that include FICO Scores are differentiated in the crowded market of generic products. It's too early to discuss the impact of this partnership agreement, but we will provide updates beginning next quarter. We believe that it will become a significant driver of revenue and earnings by the end of our fiscal year and well into the future. We continue to carefully evaluate uses of cash. This quarter, we're happy to announce the strategic acquisition of TONBELLER, but we also deployed significant cash toward share repurchases. We retired more than 800,000 shares in the first quarter and approximately 500,000 shares in January. As we look toward the future, I'm more convinced than ever that FICO is well positioned to excel in each segment of our business. We continue to invest heavily in our R&D initiatives, and we remain extremely focused on execution to deliver superior products to our customers and sustainable value growth to our investors. I'll have some summary thoughts later, but now I'll turn the call over to Mike for further financial details.
Michael J. Pung: Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. Today I will emphasize 3 points in my prepared comments. First off, we delivered $190 million of revenue, with $23 million of license revenue, the area where we historically experienced most of our lumpiness. While our Scores business was down compared to last year, our consumer offering is well positioned to drive meaningful growth going forward. Second, following last quarter's record free cash flow of $65 million, we actually had a negative cash flow of $5 million this quarter due to several large payments, mainly our annual incentive payment, which was made in November, and our estimated federal taxes.  Finally, we refinanced our revolving line of credit, increasing our capacity from $200 million to $400 million. We used the revolver to repurchase our stock, retiring 844,000 shares in quarter 1 and approximately 500,000 shares in January, as well as to fund the TONBELLER acquisition in January. I'll begin by breaking the revenue down into our 3 reporting segments. Starting with applications. Revenues were $116 million, up 3% versus the same period last year. The biggest gains came in Collections and Recovery Solutions and Originations. In the Tools segment, revenues were $30 million, up 19% versus the prior year. The growth this quarter was driven by our Blaze Advisor rules product and our data management platform. And finally in our Scores segment, revenues were $44 million, down 7% from the same period last year, which had included a large global FICO Score license. Because of that, on the B2B side, we're down 8% versus the same period a year ago. Sequentially, B2B volumes increased 4%, and on a trailing 12-month basis, we sold about 11 billion Scores. The B2C revenues were down 5% from the same quarter last year, as the product mix continues to shift away from upfront sales to subscription products. We're at an inflection point in our Scores business and given the progress Will described earlier, we expect our B2C business to grow significantly moving forward. Looking at our revenues by region. This quarter's 72% of total revenues were derived from our Americas regions. Our EMEA region generated 20% and the remaining 8% was from Asia Pacific. Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter represented 69% of total revenues, consulting and implementation revenues were 19% of total revenue and license revenues were 12% of total. Now turning to bookings. We generated $23 million of current period revenue on bookings of $70 million, a 32% yield. The weighted average term for our bookings was 21 months this quarter. Our operating expenses totaled $165 million this quarter compared to $170 million in the prior quarter, down $5 million. And they were at the higher end of the range we provided last quarter. We remain committed to investing reasonably in our growth initiatives. As Will mentioned, we have invested heavily in R&D, with continued emphasis on our Collections and Recovery and bank fraud products, as well as our Decision Management suite. With the acquisition of TONBELLER, we expect our OpEx run rate to be approximately $165 million to $170 million over the next few quarters, including amortization expense. As you can see in our Reg G schedule, non-GAAP operating margin was 19% for the first quarter. We expect for the full year that operating margins will be between 26% to 28%. GAAP net income this quarter was $14 million, down 15% from the prior year. Non-GAAP net income was $23 million for the quarter, down 14% from the same quarter last year. The effective tax rate was about 21% this quarter and was positively impacted by a catch-up from the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. We expect the effective tax rate to be about 30% to 31% for the full year. Free cash flow for the quarter was negative $5 million compared to $26 million in the prior year. While our first quarter is typically our lowest cash flow quarter, this year was particularly light due to the annual payments for incentives and some large estimated tax payments. For the trailing 12 months, cash flow was $129 million, which is more indicative of our annual expectations. Moving onto the balance sheet. We had $95 million in cash on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. This is down $10 million from last quarter. The primary activity for the quarter was share purchases and draws off our revolving line of credit. Our total debt is $607 million, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.8%. During the quarter, we refinanced our revolving credit facility, which previously had a $200 million capacity. The new facility has a capacity of $400 million, and we now have $160 million balance on that credit facility. The ratio of our total net debt to adjusted EBITDA is 2.6x, below the covenant level of 3x, and our total fixed charge coverage is at 4.6x, well above the covenant level of 2.5x. During the quarter, we returned $61 million in excess cash to our investors, repurchasing 844,000 shares at an average price of $71.78. Additionally, we repurchased approximately 500,000 shares in January. We still have nearly $150 million remaining on the latest new board authorization and continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. We also continue to actively evaluate opportunities to acquire relevant technologies and products that advance our strategy or strengthen our portfolio in competitive position. Finally, today, we are updating our guidance to reflect the purchase of TONBELLER. We expect the acquisition to provide about $10 million of revenue this fiscal year and to roughly break even during that period. We now expect revenues to be between $830 million to $835 million. We're making no changes to our previously announced guidance ranges for net income and EPS. As a reminder, this EPS guidance assumes outstanding shares of about $33 million fully diluted shares, although ongoing repurchases will likely bring that number down. With that, I'll turn it back over to Will for final comments.
William J. Lansing: Thanks, Mike. It's now been 3 years since I became the CEO of FICO. At that time, I talked about the strong IP of the company and the exceptional talent the company has to help solve our customers' most difficult problems. My goal then was to find ways to unlock some of the potential that I believe was still untapped. I'm now convinced that we're beginning to see that promise realized. Our FICO Score brand, which was long thought to be a mature product pegged to the U.S. GDP, is once again poised to deliver meaningful growth for the business. The cloud versions of our applications opened up new markets and can provide a new source of recurring revenues. And our Decision Management suite has the opportunity to change the way businesses of all sizes and across all industries use analytics to make better decisions. It's a special time in the history of FICO. We're focused, as always, on execution, yet when we pause at times like this to review where we've been, where we are today and where we're headed, we realize that the future holds a lot of promise for FICO and for our shareholders. I'll turn the call now back to Steve for Q&A.
Steven P. Weber: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we're ready now to take your questions. Mike, please open the lines.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: The first question I have was sort of a big picture question around innovation of the company. I know you talked about a lot of recent partnerships and so forth, but I was wondering how you guys look at that internally in terms of a target, like a lot of software companies have with x business revenues coming from new products over the last 3 to 4 years, et cetera. Like do you guys have targets like that? And how many new products a year or so forth are you trying to target? Can you give us some color on that?
William J. Lansing: Well, as you know, we have large, mature franchises, and bringing up new products is not a super speedy thing. We have kind of a longer-term view of our investment horizon and when those products will fully mature. For example, Decision Management suite, which we started several years ago, is just now this year becoming really commercially interesting. And in the coming years, it will be a significant contributor. But right now, it's still not moving the needle dramatically. We don't have a specific metric around percentage of revenue that have to come from new products. But we continue to pour investment into developing those new products. Our R&D is up this quarter to -- up nearly 2 points versus the year-ago period, and you see that reflected in kind of the case of what's coming out of our product and technology organization. The other place where we're seeing it is in the speed of releases. We're releasing -- I hesitate to call them updates. We're releasing additional features and functionality to our existing products at an ever faster clip, and I think you have to put that in the category of innovation. And certainly we're putting a lot of our investment energy into improving our existing products and franchises.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, fair enough. And then if I can just ask on the just relative to guidance. You gave us some good color on OpEx and I think R&D and so forth. Just wondering, I guess, obviously, licensing is lumpy. It seems like a little slow start, obviously, in this quarter. Like what are the other moving parts or onetime items in terms of comps versus last year that we should be looking out for in terms of modeling the rest of the quarters?
Michael J. Pung: Well, Manav, I think that the numbers are going to be pretty straightforward along the most variable lines. I'd say the only maybe slight anomaly we also had this quarter that will normalize itself out was our cost of revenue line item on the PL was a little higher this quarter. And that's more attributed to a couple of very large projects where we're utilizing some pretty heavy outside fees and outside costs. And we expect that to average itself out a little bit and reduce itself over the course of time and over the course of the year. The only other, I guess, point to make is that with the acquisition of TONBELLER, their heavy quarter for them, usually in their revenue cycle, is the quarter ended December. And so if you take the $10 million of revenue that we're suggesting in our guidance revision coming from TONBELLER, probably a little more than 1/3 of it, because we have 3 quarters, will come in our September quarter and you can't just annualize that. It's more heavily weighted towards the December quarter, which of course won't be in our numbers. So you can kind of spread that out with a little bit more of that revenue and the related expenses in the September quarter.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. Fair enough. And then the last one is just any FX impacts to note or how should we think about your exposure by currency?
Michael J. Pung: Well, there was a little bit, as a result of some of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Nothing that large and, therefore, we didn't report it out. We denominate a lot of our contracts, especially the legacy ones in U.S. dollars, and so the impact for us when the exchange rate moves dramatically is maybe not quite as big as it is for others.
Operator: The next question is from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: So I wanted to ask where you're seeing the greatest traction with your SaaS offering so far?
Michael J. Pung: Yes. I think the place we're seeing most of the market opportunity is coming in 3 areas: Our Collections and Recovery offering, our Originations Manager offering and our Marketing offering. Those 3 or 2 of the 3 have historically been on-premise software, the first 2. And more and more of the discussions we're having with our customers are around offering that on the cloud. I would say in addition to that, we're starting to see accelerating interest in the Decision Management platform, which we, of course, offer both on-premise and in the cloud. And most of the deals this quarter on the DMP happened to be on-premise, but we're starting certainly to see more willing to consider a cloud version of that product also.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Interesting. Okay, and then on the Scores business. You mentioned the large global contract that distorted the year-over-year comps. If you excluded that from year ago base, what would the year-over-year growth in the Scores have look like?
William J. Lansing: Bill, if you took it out, we'd be roughly even for the quarter-over-quarter as opposed to down 7%.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Got it. Okay. And so maybe if you can comment a little bit about what's going on within the Credit Card business in terms of the level of solicitations that you're seeing.
Michael J. Pung: Yes, I'd be happy to take that, Bill. So year-over-year, Will is right, we would be roughly flat in terms of dollar revenue. In terms of where the volumes are shifting, more of the volumes were shifting year-over-year towards prescreen or acquisition scores, as well as account management scores with a little bit less around originations. That's sequentially, I should say. Year-over-year, we saw a little bit higher origination Scores versus the prior year. And so when you look at the actual volumes, sequentially, they're up about 4% and pricing is down slightly because of the mix shift.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Got it. And then if you could talk a little bit about what's going on with bookings. I know that they touched down a little bit this quarter. Is it just a difficult comp that you're seeing there or -- is there anything that's going on in the environment or is it just sort of random timing of how deals are closing?
Michael J. Pung: Yes, nothing is going on in the environment. I mean, bookings tends to be a function of how many large deals we've signed at any given quarter. And frankly, we had a big revenue and a big booking quarter in quarter 3 and 4 last year and it was fairly light this quarter because of the timing of transactions. And so we view that as lumpy, heavy and lumpy, much like we view license revenue as being lumpy.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then you mentioned that the operating margin should improve significantly throughout the year going -- I think you mentioned 19% up to 26% -- 28% for the year. How do you get there? What's the bridge to that?
Michael J. Pung: Yes. The bridge to that is quite simple. I mean, we had a very -- we had an average quarter, if you will, on license revenue, and we anticipate in the back half of the year license revenue to pick up by virtue of term licenses that are scheduled to renew and just new deals that we'll sign. And we expect Scores revenue to pick up, which of course is 100% royalty margins. And those tend to offset what is typically kind of lower margin services revenue. And this quarter, as I mentioned in particular, we had a couple of very large contracts that provided the headwind on the gross margins of the company.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Got it. And then one -- just a quick housekeeping item. What was the -- it sounds like you spent about $100 million of the $250 million authorization on repurchases. Is that right?
Michael J. Pung: Yes, through January.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Through January. Then what was the actual share count exiting the December quarter, fully diluted? I was hoping to get some sort of a sense for where you are tracking so far this quarter.
Michael J. Pung: Yes. We exited the quarter, so on December 31, with 31.7 million shares outstanding. And the diluted share count, which of course takes into account options in RSUs, was at about 33 -- slightly over 33 million shares. But our actual share counts 31.7 million and declined, of course, with the purchases we did in January.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. So the January -- I wasn't sure. What was the January purchases?
Michael J. Pung: We said about 0.5 million shares, slightly more than that.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: 0.5 million? Okay.
Michael J. Pung: Yes.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Brett Huff with Stephens.
James Rutherford - Stephens Inc., Research Division: This is James Rutherford in for Brett, actually. Just a couple of questions here. First on SaaS. I know we touched on it earlier, but I was curious what the SaaS revenue growth was in the quarter and what you guys expect for the year there?
Michael J. Pung: Yes. Our SaaS revenue quarter-over-quarter growth was about 6% across all our products.
James Rutherford - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay. And I guess just conceptually, what is the big driver of the significance of the SaaS? Is that enabling you to penetrate kind of different customers that you couldn't with the on-premise license option? What's the kind of the main driver there that's helping you guys on that?
William J. Lansing: I'd say that's part of it but it's not all of it. So when you think what our SaaS business, it falls into 3 categories. There's our applications available in the cloud, which definitely opens up new potential markets and new customers and faster implementation and sometimes lower pricing. So that's one kind. Another is our debt trust, CCS area, where it's really a pure SaaS offering that's growing very nicely. And sometimes, it's sold standalone and more often it's sold in conjunction with some of our other products. And then third is kind of the new stuff coming along with Decision Management platform, where our customers have a choice of buying it on-premise or in the cloud, and increasingly we're seeing interest in the cloud offering, the cloud version. So it's all 3.
James Rutherford - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. About the Open Access, I know that that's not a direct driver of revenues near term. But I'm sort of curious, what is the link there between that and the myFICO business. Is there something going on in terms of customer acquisition that you're hoping will help drive adoption to myFICO product? And if so, is that marketing? what specifically is going on there? At this point, it's more of a brand enhancement type of activity?
William J. Lansing: It's really not designed to the customer acquisition program. I mean, our goal with Open Access was to create a lot of transparency. I mean, I think over the last several years, there has been some amount of confusion in the marketplace about FICO Scores versus, what, credit scores, and particularly versus credit scores that are not really used for lending decisions. And so our goal with Open Access was to make sure that consumers had access to the score on which the decision was being made. And fortunately, that program has come together and we have a lot of support from banks and it provides all this consumer transparency. Consumers can now see what's going on. And it's good for the banks, too. It was never really designed for customer acquisition. And I wouldn't even call it about brand building. It's more about cleaning up consumer confusion. Now we strongly believe that as the market recognizes where FICO Score is relative to other so-called education scores, other kinds of credit scores, we think that there'll be follow-on beneficial effects from that, and that goes to education programs and other kind of things that we can monetize. But monetization was definitely not the goal of Open Access. As it relates to myFICO -- I'll turn it over to Jim Wehmann and let him also speak to this. But as it relates to myFICO, myFICO is an industry-leading credit report monitoring offering. And to the extent there's some spillover effect, that's a terrific thing, but it's not -- I wouldn't call it meaningful. It's not what the intent was. Jim, I'll pass it to you and you might want to speak to some of those things.
James M. Wehmann: Yes. I mean, I think with respect to the consumer business going forward, I think what's important to keep in mind is that we're not optimizing any one channel per se. We're going to be optimizing kind of the entire opportunity. So it's frankly a little less important to us whether we are growing myFICO to its fullest extent, or are we taking advantage of kind of the entire opportunity both directly and indirectly in the consumer space.
James Rutherford - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay, understood. That's helpful. And continuing on the Scores, I know there's not a lot you guys are saying yet on the Experian deal, which seems to be pretty good for you, guys. I was curious, if you could -- is there any expectations for the Experian deal in your current guidance? And then also, are you guys talking at all about the economics in terms of the royalties from that versus some of the other perhaps B2B scoring as it stands now?
William J. Lansing: There is. Our current guidance does include our views about the Experian deal. And so I don't expect incremental there. Do we expect more to come from the industry and from other players over time? Yes. And we think that -- we're really delighted to have started this program with the premier player in credit report monitoring business and to go out to the marketplace with real FICO Scores together with Experian. As the world, as consumers, as everyone is sensitized to the difference between FICO Scores and other scores, we think there'll be more interest in incorporating FICO Scores into these credit report monitoring products. And so there could be some benefits down the road that are not in our guidance, but those are further out.
James Rutherford - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And last question for me on the Tools business, we haven't talked about that yet. Excluding the Blaze Advisor true-up, what was growth there? And then can you just talk about the dynamics in that business and kind of where the things are shaping up in the current period as well?
Michael J. Pung: Yes. We've been growing our Tools business roughly teens, low teens, over the past several years. There really was no true-up per se. We had several large deals that hit this quarter. So it's kind of hard to include or exclude any one deal and try to do a what-if. So we grew 19% and that's the number.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters.
Steven P. Weber: Thank you. This concludes today's call. Thank you, all, for joining.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Lisa, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fair Isaac Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I now turn the call over to Steve Weber. You may begin your conference.
Steven P. Weber: Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining FICO's Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. I'm Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations. And I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike Pung. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular in the Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com, or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through November 6, 2015. Now I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
William J. Lansing: Thanks, Steve , and thank you, everyone for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. I'll briefly summarize our financial results for the quarter and full fiscal year, and then talk about the progress we made this fiscal year on our strategic initiatives. Finally, I'll discuss our outlook for 2015. In our fourth quarter, we reported revenues of $222 million, an increase of 16% over the same period last year and the largest revenue quarter in company history. We delivered $37 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $1.10 per share, up 28% and 39%, respectively, from the prior year. We delivered $44 million of non-GAAP net income, up 25% from last year; and non-GAAP EPS of $1.33 per share, an increase of 36% from the same period last year. Obviously, I'm very pleased with these results, as it shows not only the strength of our recurring revenue base, but also the license revenue upside that we can deliver. And it's a great finish to a strong fiscal year with growth throughout our business. Our Applications segment was up 23% over the same period last year and up 6% for the full year. We drove significant growth both this quarter and for the full year in a number of our Applications product lines, most notably Banking Fraud, Customer Communication Solutions and Originations. Our Tools segment was up 14% for the quarter and for the full year versus the prior periods. Optimization led the growth this quarter, but Models and Rules Management were also up nicely for the full year. And our Scores segment was flat this quarter versus last year, but up 3% for the full fiscal year. We've also made significant progress this year on our strategic initiatives. We've steadily rolled out SaaS-enabled versions of our products and have signed a number of recurring revenue deals. Most of our products are now available both on-premise and in the FICO analytic cloud. While today, most of our customers still prefer an on-premise model, we believe the cloud is the future of software and long term, the cloud benefits will make this model more and more attractive. The FICO Decision Management platform, which we launched this year, continues to show promise. Just a few weeks ago, in assessing vendors worldwide in the Decision Management platform space, IDC main named FICO the major player. We were distinguished for our strategy and scored higher than all other competitors in terms of the current offering. This evaluation validates our fundamental belief in the power and value of Decision Management software to change the way business is conducted. In our Marketing Solutions business, we made great strides. We signed a landmark partnership with eBay, bringing our marketing products to the retail and e-commerce industries through a powerful channel partner. The commerce marketing platform we've developed with eBay includes a powerful mix of analytics and planning tools that integrate existing eBay Enterprise demand generation technologies with new solutions. Additional strategic partners will be announced in the coming weeks, targeting clients from the financial services, retail and health care verticals. The Marketing Solutions business also continues to scale internationally with large deals closed in fourth quarter in Asia and Latin America. We're very excited about the momentum we currently have here and about the potential to scale the business. On the Scores side, we had several major development this year. We introduced FICO Score 9 which has been more enthusiastically received by the financial services industry, regulators and consumer advocacy groups than any previous new Score version we've developed. FICO Score 9 features a more nuanced way to assess consumer collection information by passing paid collection agency accounts and offering a sophisticated treatment, differentiating medical from nonmedical collection agency accounts. Through a new modeling approach, FICO Score 9 also achieves greater predictive power across multiple credit lines, credit products and all phases of the credit-granting life cycle. The improvements in the FICO Score 9 open up the possibility of lending responsibly and profitably to a larger population than before. We continue to build momentum with the FICO Score Open Access program. Last month, I attended an event at the CFPB offices in Washington, where President Obama discussed credit fraud and announce that Citi was joining other financial institutions in making free FICO Scores available to consumers. We now estimate more than 60 million Americans will have access to their FICO scores under this program in early 2015. This quarter, we rolled out a suite of powerful comprehensive 3 bureau monitoring products that provide consumers with the ability to monitor their credit, FICO scores and identity. Our new FICO 3-Bureau Monitoring product provides consumers with an industry first. Consumers can now monitor their credit reports and FICO scores from each of the 3 bureaus in 1 simple solution, receive customized alerts and use our FICO Score simulator tool to determine how financial decisions can affect their FICO Score. With FICO Identity Ultimate, consumers can take it one step further and also receive identity theft detection and protection. These products are now available at myfico.com. Finally, we signed an agreement with Experian to make FICO Scores available through Experian's direct-to-consumer services. This compelling solution will help consumers understand and monitor their credit eligibility. We are pleased to partner with Experian because of its leadership in the category and reputable brand, and are confident that providing FICO scores directly to consumers will promote transparency and consumer financial help. Looking to the future, we continue to invest in areas of our business where we see the greatest growth potential. We remain committed to innovation, focusing our R&D investment on the FICO Decision Management platform which we see as a smart way to extend distribution of our existing IT and we are committed to building out our growing network of partners who are helping us bring our existing and new products to the widest and most receptive markets around the world. And as always, we remain on the lookout for the best ways to deploy our strong cash flow. We delivered record cash flow this year, presenting us with tremendous opportunities and also great responsibilities. We're very disciplined in how we deploy cash and continue to consider strategic acquisitions as well as share repurchases. As we look toward the year ahead, I'm more convinced than ever that FICO is well positioned to excel in each segment of our business. We remain focused on execution to deliver superior products to our customers and sustainable value growth to our investors. I'll talk more about our outlook for 2015, but first, I'll turn the call over to Mike for further financial details.
Michael J. Pung: Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll emphasize 3 points in my prepared comments. First, we delivered solid results this quarter with $222 million of revenue, including a record $46 million of license revenue. We delivered $789 million of revenue for the year which includes $112 million of license revenue. Second, we continue to deliver strong free cash flow of $65 million this quarter and $160 million for the year which we used to repurchase 215 million of our stock, lowering our share count by 8% to around 32 million shares. Finally, we are continuing to invest in our growth initiatives while maintaining financial discipline. I'll begin by breaking the revenue down into our 3 reporting segments. Starting with Applications, revenues were $147 million, up 23% versus the same period last year. For the second consecutive quarter, we've delivered the highest revenue ever recorded in this segment. The biggest gains came in Bank Fraud, up 72% from the same period last year due in part to a large multiyear term license renewal; in Originations, up 18%; and in Customer Communications Solutions, the former Adeptra business, up 10% from the same period last year. For the full year, Applications revenue were $504 million, up 6% from fiscal 2013. In the Tools segment, revenues were $29 million, up 14% versus the prior year. The growth this quarter is driven by sales of our Xpress Optimization product and our Blaze Rules products. We ended the year with $98 million of Tools revenue, up 14% from last year. And finally, in our Scores segment, revenues were $46 million, flat with the same period last year. On the B2B side, we're up 1% versus the same period a year ago. The B2C revenues were down 4% from the same quarter last year. For the full year, Scores revenues were $186 million, up 3% versus 2013. Looking at our revenue by region. This quarter, 68% of total revenue was derived from our Americas region, our EMEA region generated 23% and the remaining 9% was from Asia Pacific. Recurring revenues, derived from our transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter, represented 60% of total revenues; consulting and implementation revenues were 19% of total; and license revenues were 21% of total revenue, which again included the large renewal of a term license. Turning now to bookings. We generated $22 million of current period revenue on bookings of $86 million or a 26% yield. The weighted average term for our bookings was 22 months this quarter. Of the $86 million in bookings, 18% relates to Originations, 16% to Rules, 15% to Fraud Banking and 10% to Optimization Solutions. We had 12 booking deals in excess of $1 million, 3 of which exceeded $3 million. Transactional and maintenance bookings were 28% of total this quarter, professional services bookings were 51% this quarter and finally, license bookings were 21% in the quarter. Our operating expenses totaled $170 million this quarter compared to $161 million in the prior quarter, or up $9 million. The increase is due to increased expense associated with the additional revenue, as well as the accrual of additional incentives associated with our annual performance. As we said last quarter, we have increased our investments to support important strategic initiatives, and we expect R&D and SG&A expenses to stay roughly at these levels for the next several quarters, with our cost of revenues fluctuating with revenue. Those assumptions give us an OpEx run rate of approximately $160 million to $165 million over the next few quarters, including the amortization expense. As you can see in our Reg G schedule, non-GAAP operating margin was 29% for the fourth quarter and 27% for the full fiscal year which is about 100 basis points lower than the prior year. GAAP net income this quarter was $37 million and $95 million for the fiscal year, up 28% and 5%, respectively. Non-GAAP net income was $44 million for the quarter, up 25% from the same quarter last year; and it was $128 million for the year, up 5% from last year. The effective tax rate was about 18% this quarter and was positively impacted by a favorable adjustment related to the settlement of an audit and due to a mix shift in profits to lower tax jurisdictions. We expect the effective tax rate to be about 31% to 32% for the full year in fiscal '15. The free cash flow for the quarter was $65 million or 29% of revenue, compared to $32 million or 17% of revenues in the prior year. For the entire fiscal year, we delivered $160 million of free cash flow compared with $109 million last year, an increase of 46%. Moving on to the balance sheet. We have $105 million in cash on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. This is up about $12 million from last quarter driven by the cash generated from operations and draws off our revolving line of credit and offset by share repurchases. Our total debt of $546 million with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2%. We now have $99 million balance on our $200 million revolving credit facility. The ratio of our total net debt to adjusted EBITDA is to 2.1x which is below the covenant level of 3x, and our total fixed charge coverage ratio is at 5x, well above the covenant level of 2.5x. During the quarter, we returned $56 million in excess cash to our investors, repurchasing about 900,000 shares at an average price of $63.57. For the full fiscal year, we repurchased 3.7 million shares at an average price of $58.87, effectively reducing our outstanding shares by 8%. We still have the full $250 million remaining on the new board authorization and continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. We are also actively evaluating opportunities to acquire relevant technologies and products that advance our strategy or strengthen our portfolio and competitive position. With that, I'll turn it back over to Will for his thoughts on fiscal '15.
William J. Lansing: Thanks, Mike. As I said in my opening remarks, I'm pleased with what we were able to accomplish this year. We continue to build out our product functionality through our own innovation and through strategic acquisitions; we've made great strides enabling our applications for the cloud; and we've been identified as the leader in the Decision Management software platform space. We further solidified our market-leading position in our Scores business, and have positioned ourselves for new opportunities to our Open Access program and with our enhanced relationship with Experian. With that as a backdrop, I'll now turn to guidance. As we look ahead, we see a number of opportunities as we extend our consumer and software offerings into new industries and new markets. At the same time, we see our core financial services customers continuing to operate under difficult regulatory and operating constraints, creating a challenging sales cycle and further lumpiness in our license revenue. With all this in mind, we're providing the following guidance for fiscal '15. We expect revenues to be between $820 million and $825 million, an increase of about 4% to 4.5% versus fiscal '14; we expect GAAP net income between $92 million and $95 million; GAAP earnings per share between $2.78 and $2.88; non-GAAP net income between $131 million and $134 million; and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.97 to $4.06. The EPS guidance assumes current share counts, although as Mike said, we continue to view new purchases as an attractive use of our cash. I'll now turn the call back to Steve for Q&A.
Steven P. Weber: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks and we're ready now to take your questions. Lisa, please open the line.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: The -- I wanted to ask about the -- on the tax rate for the quarter, you mentioned there were some onetime adjustments there in terms of the settlement of the audit. What is that EPS? If you have an adjusted EPS with sort of a normalized, if you back that out, what would the EPS have been?
Michael J. Pung: Yes, the EPS -- favorable impact to the EPS for that adjustment, Bill, was $0.06 a share.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: $0.06, got it. The -- now on the large buyback that you have potentially in front of you, how much of that is reflected in the 2015 EPS guidance?
Michael J. Pung: None of it is. We've left the EPS guidance on the average shares exiting the year in any buyback we do with the additive to the guidance we've provided.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Got it, okay. And then the on the Open Access program, it sounds like that is going to create a lot of brand awareness for you. My question for you is, how do you go about monetizing that?
Michael J. Pung: So Bill, that's a great question. So we rolled the Open Access program out about a year ago. To date, we've had incredible branding done through the partners that have signed up for the program. Discover, being one of the most notable. The way we see monetizing Open Access going forward is very consistent with what we've described in the past. First, driving traffic to the myFICO website. We've loaded the website up with a brand-new set of products, a suite of products in the month of August that includes credit monitoring and identity theft monitoring and protection, giving us one of the best offerings in the industry. And we believe that branding will naturally drive traffic to that and will convert into ratable revenue in the form of credit monitoring products. So that's number one. Number two, we believe, much like the Experian situation, that others that sell scores into the consumer industry will see the value of bundling a FICO Scoring with their products. And as consumers demand for the FICO Score as part of these offerings grows, we see more opportunities for relationships with others in the industry to resell our products. And finally, the banks historically have had affinity add-on programs that have included a number of financial products including Score monitoring and Scores that they've sold to their consumers on their own white-labeled websites. We see an opportunity for the FICO Score in that regard as well. So we see numerous opportunities over the next several years that the door has been opened through the Open Access program.
William J. Lansing: I would just add, Bill, that -- this is Will. I would add that our intent with Open Access program was not to make a lot of money from it. That was never the intent. The intent was to make sure that we can get the FICO Score into the hands of consumers so that they could see what their FICO Score looked like. And this is the score the banks use and we want to make sure that consumers get a chance to see it. So it's about transparency. There's obviously a big branding benefit for us, and we love the fact that consumers are increasingly aware of the difference between a FICO Score and so-called education scores that are similar looking to FICO scores, but that actually are not the scores that lenders use. And so that was really the intent of the program and so far, we are very pleased with the way it's rolling out.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: You'll have the brand of the FICO inside.
William J. Lansing: Yes, you got it. You definitely, got it.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: The one last question for you then. If you can maybe talk a little bit about some of the assumptions that are in the -- or behind the revenue guidance for the year in terms of how you're going to get to that level?
Michael J. Pung: Yes, I'll take that, Bill. This is Mike. So we obviously have come off of a tremendous fourth quarter where we've had phenomenal license revenue, $46 million, as I mentioned on the call. That $46 million is almost twice what it has historically been over the last couple of years on a quarterly basis. And so as we've said in the past and I think most notable, the timing of when revenue is signed can be very lumpy, when license revenue signs, in some quarters, it slips; in some quarters, it doesn't; and this one, it didn't slip. So as we took our fourth quarter and our year-to-date experience and we portrayed it forward, the timing of these license deals remain tricky. And with the challenges that the banks are still facing in the markets we serve, we weighed the pluses and the minuses. The pluses being momentum we're picking up through Open Access and on the consumer side, other momentum on our recurring revenue base in the products that are starting to go live in that area and we weighed that against the minuses, the headwinds in the industries we serve and the lumpiness to the license revenue. And that became the basis for the 4% to 4.5% revenue growth we laid out. Certainly, at that level, 4% to 4.5%, the license revenue is probably a bit lighter than it was this year with some probably increased strength on the recurring revenue side.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Galinko from Sidoti.
Matthew Galinko - Sidoti & Company, Inc.: I guess the first one is around -- I know we talked last quarter about wanting to ramp your sales capacity. I guess, I'm wondering at the close of this quarter, how are you feeling in terms of addressing that need?
William J. Lansing: Well, we have been in a build mode all year and we've added some salespeople, we've added some sales coverage and we had built into our budget for next year incremental sales coverage. So we're feeling pretty good. That said, we could always do more. I mean, the fact is and I've said this before, our product portfolio and our IP vastly outstrips our ability in sales and distribution. We just don't have the coverage that we wish we had given the quality of our products and the appetite for our products. So we'll continue to be strong in financial services where we have a good sales force, and we will continue to invest, I would say, on a conservative basis, in new verticals, where we continue to do that. And I think channels will continue to be an important area for us because that kind of amplifies and gives us additional leverage.
Matthew Galinko - Sidoti & Company, Inc.: Got it. And then in terms of the new myfico.com services, I'm curious if you could talk a little bit more about your marketing strategy to drive traffic and users to the site, and sort of how you look to build awareness of those features?
William J. Lansing: I'd say it's a two-pronged approach. So on the one hand, we do what other e-commerce and Internet-based players do in terms of SEO and SEM, and we have very smart and capable people doing the math on customer acquisition cost versus lifetime value, and we're kind of an open-ended budget for spending as much on customer acquisition as the lifetime value will support. So on that basis, as our product continues to get stronger, which it does, we now have the industry-leading product. As it continues to get stronger, our lifetime value increases and our ability to spend more in customer acquisition will go up, until we see kind of the direct customer acquisition efforts as being strong from that standpoint. The other is side of it is all the things that we wrap around the myFICO offering that are a little less traditional. So our myFICO site has a tremendous amount of educational content, hundreds and hundreds of pages of educational content which is, I would say, is industry-leading, best-in-class, and there is fairly significant SEO component to what we do there. And then finally, the Open Access program, as we mentioned earlier, is raising awareness and we get some spillover effect from that.
Matthew Galinko - Sidoti & Company, Inc.: Got it. Then one last one for me. I know you talked a little bit about preference for traditional license type deals that you're seeing from your customers and which I think we clearly saw this quarter versus a cloud or SaaS deal. I'm curious sort of how that decision process is going for the customers? Why are they preferring the traditional license model? And do you think that should sort of shift as we move into '15, and can that influence the potential for repeat growth kind of year in license?
William J. Lansing: Yes. Let me see if I can clarify. I would say that to the extent there's a preference, it's not so much a preference for a license model as it is a preference for on-premise. So what we have is the banking industry, the financial institutions are far more in the on-premise camp than in the cloud camp. And so that's how they typically buy. And with that, comes a certain amount of license revenue and license structuring to the deals. But even within that, we do a tremendous amount of volume-based and transaction-based revenue. As you know, our recurring revenue is the majority of our revenue. The thing that we see happening is, as our SaaS offerings become more accepted by the marketplace, those typically are sold on a more ratable basis. The revenue gets recognized on a more ratable basis. And so we'll see that continue. And so over time -- and I can't tell you exactly what the time frame is, but over time, I think you will see that our recurring revenue as a percent of total will continue to creep upward. But in any given quarter, who knows? Because all it takes is one big license deal to push the number down. So I think that all we were saying is that today, banks and the financial institutions favor on-premise solutions, which go hand-in-hand often with license revenue recognition. But longer-term, I think we see that changing.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Huff from Stephens Inc.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: A couple of questions, just along the SaaS lines that I was trying to get my arms around. When you all think about how this year, the SaaS deals that you closed, did it make a measurable dent or headwind into your revenue growth? And when you gave guidance for next year, I mean, was there like 20 basis points or 80 basis points, or some sort of taking license out of this period and spreading it out forward? Any thoughts on that?
Michael J. Pung: Yes, Brett, this is Mike. So we have between our Adeptra business, our Marketing Solutions business and other pockets, we actually have about $160 million a year of hosted or SaaS business and have for the last couple of years. This year's growth year-over-year was slightly below $5 million compared to the prior year. It relates -- that additional growth relates to some of the deals we signed this year and then have gone live, as well as just growth in volumes there being pushed through by the existing line of business. And so to answer your question directly, the amount of growth into fiscal '14 was quite small. It was less than $5 million. As we think about fiscal '15 and as we thought about it, the business, at least for the next few quarters and foreseeable -- for at least the next few quarters, is probably still going to be more heavily driven through on-premise and the revenue will be created, if you will, through an on-premise model which usually has an upfront license revenue to it. And as we start to sign more and more cloud deals and the ratable deals, some of that will probably add to it in the latter part of next year and then it will start to grow from there, because as you know, you have to go through the implementation process to get them live and then begin to grow the revenue. So we've built in similar kinds of thoughts into next year. There won't be a dramatic shift, at least not that we see over the next couple of quarters. But hopefully, we'll continue to sign more and more business as we did this year.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then the second SaaS question. Can you just give us sort of the anecdotal or the sort of the best-use case, successful use case that you used? And maybe this is a SaaS question or channel question, I'm not really sure which. But the most successful channel -- new channel method that you're using or maybe -- and I assume again, that's a SaaS delivery, what's the one that's the most popular that you found that greatest traction with most quickly?
William J. Lansing: Just to clarify, you focused on what kinds of customers are interested in our cloud offerings, or you're focused on the distribution piece of it?
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Well, I'm -- maybe I'm confusing the 2. My question is mostly around the channel. So what new channel have you used as a distribution mechanism? I know you've been talking about trying to do indirect IP distribution basically. What's the one that kind of works best...
William J. Lansing: Yes, good question. So we have a channels group with some very capable business development executives who are always looking for different mechanisms to take our products and our IP to market. And it's a wide range, everything from processors to major retailers, to -- I mean, there are different ways of taking our IP to market. Probably a great example is our eBay partnership. So we entered into this partnership with eBay, and as you know, they have tremendous, tremendous reach with a tremendous number of retailers who use them for eBay Enterprise is an infrastructure backbone end support for eBay retailers. And that's completely separate from their Marketplace division. This is eBay Enterprise. And one of the things that they wanted to do as part of providing capabilities to their retailer customers is improve the analytics that they provide. And so we entered into this partnership with them, where we took our campaign management platform and some of our analytics and did some additional work to tailor them to soothe eBay's needs. And eBay is now taking out our IP, our analytics IP and some of our campaign management IP out to their customers. And it's just -- it's a lovely partnership because they get best-in-class analytics and campaign management, and we get distribution to all kinds of retailers that we never ever would have gotten near.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then one question, just on the margins. When we see a big license quarter, typically, I thought we would see a pretty big-margin quarter on the gross margins, and I didn't see that, but I'm wondering if I'm missing something. If there was -- there's a dynamic there that I'm not getting.
Michael J. Pung: No, there's no dynamic there. The numbers are the numbers that we reported. The margin for the fourth quarter, which was around 30%, that's the adjusted margin we report. It also includes the cost to deliver the revenues. So some of that review growth came on the services side, so there's a bit of a mix shift, some additional expenses there. And at the end of the year, we true-up all of our incentives, our sales incentives and our across-the-business incentives, and we perform quite well and we had a larger-than-average incentive accrual. And I suppose that maybe takes away what you would have guessed some of the pop would have been with the license revenue we did do.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then last question for me. I know you've had a logjam of longer sales cycles on the Applications business, and I know that we've had a couple of good bookings quarters in the past 2 quarters and the bookings were still sequentially up a little bit, but did down a little bit year-over-year. Is that logjam in Applications specifically over? I think you -- one of you mentioned in your prepared comments that sale cycles are still elongated. So I'm trying to figure out, is there sort of more to come on that, or are we through that initial logjam?
Michael J. Pung: Well, last year, as you know, we had a lot of deals slip in our fourth quarter. So the same time last year, we were giving you a lot of different news and it was slipped deals. It took about 6, 9, 12 months to work many of those deals through the pipeline. And what had slipped last year for the most part has worked itself through the pipeline. Logjams can come and go. And whether we have another logjam that comes along is yet to be determined. But for the most part, we work through the issues we had last year and we're very happy with where it ended up. It maybe took a little longer but at the end of the day, it was worth the wait.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays.
Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Research Division: This is actually Greg calling on for Manav. I was wondering if you could give some color on how you're thinking about the different segments of the consumer credit landscape going into 2015. Where are you seeing strengths and where are you seeing the puts and takes there?
William J. Lansing: Yes, I'm not sure what's underneath your question. I mean it's a pretty complicated landscape. There's obviously the credit report monitoring business which we are in with myfico.com and which others, especially the bureaus are in with paid subscription products. There are incremental products that are now being overlaid on the credit report monitoring offerings, like identity theft. And again, we have it at myfico.com, and some others also have incorporated that capability in their offerings. I think increasingly, you're seeing any major player who has customers and good customer relationships who has some kind of logic for why they would be offering it is now considering or reconsidering being in the affinity space, where they take an offering from someone else and sell it through their consumers, and we are now on that business and starting to compete for that business. And so that's kind of a B2B2C business, but it's the same offering under the covers as myfico.com. I think that after slower growth over the last few years in the affinity space, I think we're going to see that space pick up a bit. So I hope that answers your question. I mean, it's a good -- and then we also have -- I guess the thing I would add that's new is we have some of the players in the premium space have come in to this credit report monitoring and they give away free scores and free summary credit reports in exchange for the right to use your -- the consumers' data for lead generation. I would note that to our knowledge, none of those players is using the FICO Score. They're using what are terribly called education scores. We call them Fake-o scores. And so they're not the score that lenders use. So there's a -- we have quite a bit of concern actually about confusion in the marketplace as these guys go out and say, "Get your free credit score." When in fact it's not your -- it's not the credit score that the banks are using. It's not a FICO Score. And so the question mark, "what is it?" But those players have gotten some traction and I think, again, with Open Access and with increasing consumer understanding of what's really going on in the marketplace, we think that consumers will know the difference between a FICO Score and some other score. The other thing is, you can see kind of the battle lines drawing between the premium players who give away your data. They take your data and they don't charge you anything for it, but they turnaround and they use it for lead generation purposes. And then the -- I would say the players who are much more careful with your data and don't use it that way. And that -- I'd say that we're in that category along with the major bureaus. We're very careful with the consumers' data and careful not to use it in ways it's not intended to be used. And so I -- you're seeing this kind of free/no privacy versus paid subscription, quality and regard for privacy. You're seeing that -- those battle lines developing in the consumer credit report monitoring space, and I think you're going to see that continue. I think that the consumers will become more aware. It's going to be interesting to see how that plays out.
Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, that's great color. And I guess I probably wasn't totally clear on my question. I meant more along the lines of spaces in consumer lending that you're seeing strength, your auto has shown some strength recently. And how you're thinking about those different segments of the market going into 2015?
William J. Lansing: I'm not sure that we're in the best position to comment on that. I mean, I -- obviously, there've been a lot of credit card customer acquisition efforts in recent months, so I think that's way up. I think that refi has had much more longevity than anyone has expected, and so people are still pulling mortgage scores. I don't need to tell you that the auto industry is in pretty good shape and so auto scores are being pulled. But I don't think we're telling you anything you don't already know.
Michael J. Pung: No, we haven't seen any big shift in mix or any kind of amazing emerging trends in that regard.
Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, fair enough. And then you talked about the longer sales cycle, but you're seeing strong results in Applications business. I was just wondering if the tenor of conversations with the customers has changed at all. Or how you -- how those conversations have been going, especially heading into another budgeting cycle?
William J. Lansing: We are -- our products, our application offerings and also our tools, for that matter, are aimed at kind of 3 areas. One is revenue growth, and we come at that in a lot of different ways; the second is expense control, we come at that in a bunch of different ways; and third, risk and compliance. And our conversations with financial institutions are around all 3 of those areas. On the revenue side, our decisioning applications help banks to make the smartest decision they possibly can. And basically, their objective function is profitability or revenue growth, we help them with that. On the cost side, we have collections and recovery applications and other things that help them on the cost side. And then I guess, I'm very proud of our model central offering, which is a model management offering that is industry-leading and starting to be adopted by the major banks. And so I think there's a lot of interest there because all these banks are interested in demonstrating to regulators that they have excellent control of their business. They have a lot of visibility into the models that are being used. They have good visibility into how the risk around their decisions is. And our model central offering is very much designed to help them with model management, what models went into place when, what attributes were put in place when, when do they go from test to production. All of those kind of things that a bank wants in order to run its business better and also to demonstrate to a regulator that it understands how to run its business well, all of that is tremendously interesting to banks. And so that's been a big conversation recently.
Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And one more modeling one, if I can sneak it in. A popular topic over the last few weeks is FX, and I was just wondering how do you think of your exposure there and if you do anything to hedge any of your exposure?
Michael J. Pung: Well -- oh I'm sorry. We hedge the balance sheet risks and kind of our receivables. We have business lines in kind of the larger parts of the world where we have operating expenses that naturally hedge the revenue that we generate. The FX impact frankly on the P&L hasn’t been that huge for us, and it's maybe not as big of an issue as it is for others you follow.
Operator: There are no further questions in the queue. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters.
Steven P. Weber: Thank you, Lisa. This concludes today's call. Thank you all for your interest in FICO and for joining today.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2014 Q3  (2014-07-24 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Steven P. Weber - Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer, President and Director Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Chief of Investor Relations and Executive Vice President
Analysts: Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Research Division Matthew Galinko - Sidoti & Company, LLC William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Suzanne, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fair Isaac Corporation Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Steve Weber, you may begin your conference.
Steven P. Weber: Thank you, Suzanne. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining FICO's third quarter earnings call. I'm Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike Pung. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular in the Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through July 24, 2015. Now I will turn the call over to Will Lansing
William J. Lansing: Thanks, Steve. Today, we announced the results for our third quarter of fiscal 2014. I'll briefly recap those results, update you on the status of our strategic initiatives and talk about how we see our business position as we enter the last quarter of our fiscal 2014. In our third quarter, we reported revenues of $198 million, an increase of 8% over the same period last year. We delivered $21 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $0.58 per share, up 5% and 8% respectively from the prior year. We delivered $29 million of non-GAAP net income, flat with last year, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.83 per share, an increase of 3% from the same period last year. We had another good bookings quarter, delivering $84 million of new deals, up 20% from the prior year. I'm pleased with these results and encouraged that much of our revenue growth this quarter was driven by our Applications segment, an area where we had seen limited growth over the last several quarters. In fact, the Application segment was up 13% over the same period last year, and the growth was throughout the entire Applications portfolio, with double-digit growth in Marketing, Mobility, Originations, Banking Fraud and Collections and Recovery. Our Q2 bookings and Q3 revenues and Applications show the progress we've made in pursuing our growth strategy in this segment. We've added functionality to many of our products, and in most cases, they are now available on a SaaS basis. We believe this opens up new markets to us for these best-in-class products and will create new growth opportunities for us going forward. In fact, this quarter, we sold our first large Decision Management platform deal to a large telecommunications company. In our Scores business, we continue to make progress on our consumer initiatives. This past quarter, we announced that Hyundai Motor Finance, Kia Motors Finance and Sallie Mae will all be providing FICO Scores to their customers. We now have 14 customers participating in our Open Access program. We're also in final stages of discussions with several large card issuers to deliver Open Access or our credit education program or both. Consumers know the FICO brand. As they come to understand how the FICO Score is used by lenders, we believe they will have a better handle on their own financial situations, and there will be less confusion in the marketplace. In our third quarter, we also made significant investments in our business. Mike will go into further detail when he discusses the numbers. But I'd like to give you the rationale behind these strategic investments. First, we significantly increased our R&D spending to address a tremendous opportunity, which is to extend the distribution of our IP through new platforms, both through our Decision Management platform and also through platforms being built with third-party distributors. We view these as excellent opportunities to meet evidence demand and provide more robust and competitive products to our existing and prospective customers. We have also made some important investments in our sales and marketing function. This includes geographic expansion to emerging markets that have demand for our products and also improve coverage in our existing geographies. As we plan for continued growth, we're committed to having the proper sales resources and distribution channels in place to bring our products to market. We view these investments as critical to fueling the long-term growth and competitive strength that we believe we can drive from our assets. This quarter, we also returned substantial value to shareholders through our share repurchase program. As I've said in the past, we're committed to repurchases, not just to offset dilution, but also to give loyal shareholders a bigger piece of an expanding pie. In the third quarter, we repurchased nearly 1.6 million shares, more than 4% of the shares outstanding. We continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash, and our strong cash flow provides us opportunities both to repurchase shares and to make strategic acquisitions that will strengthen our portfolio and competitive position. As we move through the final quarter of our fiscal 2014 and look toward the year ahead, I'm more convinced than ever that FICO is well positioned to excel in each of the segments of our business. We remain extremely focused on execution to deliver superior products for our customers and sustainable value growth to our investors. I'll now turn the call over to Mike for further financial details.
Michael J. Pung: Thanks, Will. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll emphasize 3 points in my prepared comments. First, our revenues this quarter were $198 million, an 8% increase from last year. Our Applications business grew 13% to $130 million, with increased revenues across the entire portfolio. Second, we delivered $21 million of GAAP net income, and $29 million of non-GAAP net income. Free cash flow was $25 million for the quarter, and we returned $94 million to our shareholders through our share buybacks. Finally, we are refining our guidance for the full year to reflect the current business momentum. I'll break revenues down into our 3 reporting segments, starting with Applications, where revenue was up 13% to $130 million versus the same period last year and up 12% versus last quarter. This is the highest revenue we've ever recorded in our Applications segment, delivering growth across all of the products in the portfolio compared with the same period last year. The biggest gains came in Marketing, up 26% from the same period last year; Mobility and Originations, both up 17%; and Bank Fraud, which is up 13% from the same period last year. We also had a good bookings quarter in Applications, signing $54 million of new deals, up 24% from the same period last year. In the Tools segments revenues were $22 million, up 4% versus the prior year. The growth this quarter was driven by sales in our Blaze Rules product. We also had a good bookings quarter in Tools, up from 31% from the same quarter last year. Finally, in our Scores segments, revenues were $45 million, down 4% from the same period last year. On the B2C side, we're up 6%, versus last year on the B2B revenues, we were down 7% from the same quarter last year due to a mix shift towards volumes with lower price points. Looking at our revenue by regions. This quarter 69% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region, our EMEA region generated 23% and the remaining 8% was from Asia Pacific. Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter represented 67% of total revenues. Consulting and implementation revenues were 19% of total revenue, and license revenue were 14% of total. Turning now to bookings. We generated $15 million of current period revenues on bookings of $84 million or an 18% yield. The weighted average term of our bookings was 28 months this quarter. Of the $84 million in bookings, 19% relates to Rules; 16% each to banking fraud and Collections and Recovery; and 10% to Marketing Solutions. We had 14 booking deals in excess of $1 million, 5 of which exceeded $3 million. Transactional and maintenance bookings were 24% of the total this quarter. Professional services bookings were 47% this quarter. And finally, license bookings were 29% in the quarter. Our operating expenses totaled $161 million this quarter, when compared to $147 million in the prior quarter or up $14 million. As Will mentioned, we increased our investments to support important strategic initiatives. We added 19 additional heads to our sales and marketing functions, as we built out our teams to meet demand, increased our lead-generation spend and invested in other customer-related activities. We also increased R&D expense by $4 million, as we're in a heavy investment period for our Decision Management platform. Finally, our cost of revenues was higher, primarily driven by third-party contractors, utilized this quarter to deliver increased services revenues. While these additional investments created some headwind in the near term, they were made towards advancing our strategic objectives. As you can see from our Reg G schedule, our non-GAAP operating margin remained at 25% in the third quarter, unchanged from the same period last year. GAAP net income was $21 million, flat with the prior quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $29 million, also the same as the prior quarter. The effective tax rate was 32% this quarter. We expect the effective tax rate to be about 33% to 34% for the full year, unless the R&D credit is reinstated before the end of our year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $25 million or 13% of revenue compared to $27 million or 15% of revenue in the prior year. Fiscal year-to-date, we've delivered $95 million of free cash flow compared to $78 million in the first 3 quarters of last year. Moving on to the balance sheet. We have $93 million in cash on the balance sheet. This is down $15 million from last quarter, driven by share repurchases and partially offset by the cash we generated from our operations, and draws off our revolving line of credit. Our total debt is $530 million, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.3%, with [indiscernible] of $83 million balance under our $200 million revolving credit facility. The ratio of our total net debt to adjusted EBITDA is 2.2x, below the covenant level of 3x. Our fixed charge coverage ratio is at 4.9x, well above the covenant level of 2.5x. During the quarter, we returned $94 million in excess cash to our investors, repurchasing about 1.6 million shares at an average price of $59.36, putting us at the end of the quarter with remaining $56 million on the current $150 million board authorization. And we continued to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. We also evaluate opportunities to acquire relevant technologies and products that advance our strategy or strengthen our portfolio and competitive position. Finally, I'd like to discuss our full year guidance as we enter our final quarter. Three quarters in, we are now refining our guidance to the following: we believe revenues will be between $773 million to $776 million; GAAP net income will be between $88 million to $90 million; GAAP earnings per share will be between $2.53 and $2.60 per share; non-GAAP net income, between $122 million to $124 million; and finally, non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.51 to $3.56. These changes reflect the revenue momentum we have built from our bookings growth and view of our current sales pipeline and also the impact of the additional investments and share repurchases we made in quarter 3. Next quarter, we'll be providing guidance for fiscal 2015. So with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve for Q&A.
Steven P. Weber: Thanks, Mike. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we're ready now to take your questions. Suzanne, please open the lines.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik.
Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Research Division: This is Greg calling on for Manav. I'm going to ask about the B2B business and the mix shift towards volumes with lower price points. I'm just wondering if that's a strategic decision or if that's a fluctuation that we could see reversed going forward.
Michael J. Pung: Yes, no, that's not a strategic decision. It's simply a function of banks and those that buy credit scores from us buying more prescreened Scores, marketing Scores, which are at lower price points than Originations compared to last year. Those will ebb and flow depending upon marketing programs, and health and consumer lending.
Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then, I guess, on the buybacks, highest in recent memory. Wondering if there's any reason to expect a slowdown there, or is that kind of a pace we can expect going forward?
William J. Lansing: Greg, the way we think about buybacks, we've talked about this in the past, is that we balance buybacks against M&A activity. And we continue to feel like investing in ourselves is a really great opportunity. We're very happy with our prospects. That said, there's imperative about time to market. And so when it's appropriate, when we can find the right deal at the right price, we do from time to time, go out and buy other companies. In the last year, they've been very small, and they really haven't affected us in any kind of dilutive way. Where we sit today is we have a very active M&A group, corporate development group that scours the planet for interesting tuck-in acquisitions and bigger acquisitions, frankly. But at the same time, our sense is that valuations are high. And so as we think about the trade-off between buying businesses and buying assets versus building things ourselves organically, we have been -- in the last year for sure, we have been favoring organic build. And you see that reflected in our expenses. Our P&L reflects the investments that we've been making in, especially in product development. And some of those are very specifically opportunities where we considered buying companies and thought, you know what, we can build the same or better for less money and it'll take a little bit longer, but we're patient, and we know we'll do a high-quality job doing it ourselves and controlling it. And so kind of given valuations in the marketplace and given our own skills in building the stuff ourselves, lately, we've been favoring organic build with the P&L expense impact that, that brings. The benefit is that it has freed up plenty of cash for stock buyback, and so we've been taking advantage of that. So the long answer to your question is, we continue to be interested in buyback. We'll continue to do it cash permitting. And it does compete with M&A and it all depends on the opportunities in front of us, and they vary from quarter-to-quarter. But right now, valuations feel pretty full out there.
Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. That makes sense. And maybe just talking big picture on the macro backdrop before the consumer. What are you seeing there? Are you seeing banks starting to move down the credit quality chain? And are there specific asset classes that you see elements of credit loosening?
William J. Lansing: What we are seeing is banks moving. They continue to be very focused on compliance and the new regulations, making sure that they are really buttoned up from a risk and compliance standpoint. But we've recently seen more appetite for focusing on the business itself and improving revenue. And so you see a little more originations activity, you see a little more prescreen, which I think is a function of their belief that, that consumer is ready to engage in a little more business. So that's what we're seeing.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Galinko, Sidoti.
Matthew Galinko - Sidoti & Company, LLC: First one is just how many of the additional sales headcount is quota carrying? And can you provide a number of how many sort of total quota-carrying reps you have at this point?
William J. Lansing: We don't break that out. That's -- we just haven't shared that, and we don't do that.
Michael J. Pung: It's pretty safe to say, though, that as we're adding new heads, they're field people rather than marketing people, and they're quota-carrying folks, Matt.
William J. Lansing: That's correct.
Matthew Galinko - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Got you. Fair enough. And should we think of this sort of as a trend where maybe we'll be adding more through the balance of the year? Or are you pretty comfortable with numbers where you're at?
William J. Lansing: Actually, it's a great question, and it's a question that we debate internally all the time. What's very clear is that our IP and our product portfolio far exceeds our distribution capability. And we go to market directly, we go to market through partners, we go to market every way we can. But the direct side of that equation, we are growing it, and we're growing it as much as we can afford to invest in it, and it's still not enough. And so we spend a lot of time looking at channel partners and trying to develop channel partners. We are investing in -- I mentioned earlier, we're investing in platforms that partners of ours can use to take our IP to their customers. So that's a long way of saying we feel like our distribution is not as big as it should be. And we want to improve it on every dimension, both directly and through channels and partners.
Matthew Galinko - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Got you. And then one last one. On the R&D side, should we see the increase this quarter kind of as a -- and maybe over the next couple of quarters, as kind of a burst? Or is that a level we can kind of expect to sustain over a couple of years as you build out new functionality?
William J. Lansing: Probably safer to think of it in terms of years because we -- the opportunity is enormous. We will -- we're going to wind up with fleshing out the product portfolio and our technology either organically or through M&A. To the extent that it happens organically, which we're doing now and which we anticipate doing for the foreseeable future, you will see, I wouldn't call a burst, I'd call it a sustained burst of R&D, especially D, kind of expense. So yes, I think, it's something to plan on. Yes, I think that's a fair thing to plan on.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: So a question for you on the Open Access program. Just wanted to ask if -- what type of benefits you've been seeing and whether you're seeing that flow through to actual revenue yet, or what it would take to see that.
William J. Lansing: Well, so probably everyone on the call has seen some of our partners leveraging our Open Access program to put FICO Scores in the hands of their consumers. And most notably, Discover and Barclays have been really promoting the FICO Score as part of their offering. But we're in talks with a lot of other banks to do this. I think that we've shared that the Open Access program is not designed to be a revenue driver in itself. The idea is that it is a score that can be freely reused, so if a bank uses the score in making a credit decision, they are free to share that score with a consumer for free. We don't get money from that. It's part of -- the good citizen part of that is there's a lot of transparency, and the consumers can learn -- can understand how the credit system works better, when they can see their FICO Score and how the decisions are made. The longer-term benefit from that for us is, obviously, our consumer scores franchise is that much stronger, our brand identity is that much stronger. And we have programs built around it like an education, an Credit Education Program, which we're in conversation with banks about, where there are additional paid services that kind of build off of Open Access, although they're not tied to Open Access. And so we think that there's a revenue opportunity there. And so that's really where it's going. I would say it's very early innings. We're not seeing -- so the short answer is there's no revenue from Open Access today. It wasn't designed to be a revenue producer. But it is proceeding exactly according to plan in terms of strengthening the franchise and giving us opportunities for other revenue-producing things like our credit education programs, which we're now sharing with other banks.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. In terms of your cloud offering. Last quarter, I believe, you sold about $10 million of the new backlog that came from the SaaS versions of Debt Manager and Originations Manager. The -- how did that trend this quarter? I can't remember if you gave that number or not.
Michael J. Pung: Yes, we didn't, Bill. This quarter, cumulative from the beginning of the year, we're at about $14 million or so of backlog. So we signed up about another $4 million. So we're moving along.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Yes, definitely. And then I wanted to ask about specifically on -- I couldn't remember if you mentioned specifically credit card-related volumes. They were up very strongly last quarter. And I just wanted to ask about those this quarter.
Michael J. Pung: Yes, so credit card marketing was up a tick from where it was compared to last year, down actually slightly from last quarter. I don't think there's any apparent trend there, but those were how the volume numbers came out. Auto volumes for Origination were strong. Much of the rest was not on the Originations side. So it was a solid quarter on the Score side, but I wouldn't call it extraordinary or the signs of any trends on the B2B side this quarter.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Got you. And then I just wanted to ask if you were seeing -- to describe what -- if you're seeing any change in terms of the volume and the quality of the deals that you're seeing out there in the market for M&A.
William J. Lansing: The volume and quality of deals? There's plenty of volume. I mean, there's a lot of opportunity. And we have a lot of stuff go through our Corp Dep department. And quality -- price aside, the quality [indiscernible] there's a lot of good assets out there. There's a lot of innovation going on. And particularly in our space, in the analytic space, you have tons of startups. You have established companies, more established companies that have now built franchises over a period of years. And so there's a lot of attractive opportunities. But everything is relative, and so it may be an attractive asset. But if the price isn't so attractive, or if it's not attractive relative to investing in ourselves, you see us sitting on the sidelines, and that's what you've seen.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens Inc.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: On 4Q, just based on what you guys have said, it sounds like we should expect an absolutely, sort of maybe roughly flat level on R&D from 3Q to 4Q. My question is what's going to sort of get us to that higher or the higher sort of margin that's implied for 4Q? Is it better gross margins? Is it lower SG&A? Kind of how does that trend for 4Q? And then maybe can I ask that question again for as we look into next year also.
Michael J. Pung: Yes, so for the fourth quarter, what we believe from the modeling we've done and the guidance we gave is that we ought to have a heavier mix in license revenue than we have throughout the year. It doesn't necessarily mean services revenue are going to go down dramatically. We have a lot of services backlog that we've been burning, and that, of course, has been driving some of the growth. But as we mentioned last quarter, we have some renewals coming through on the license side. And we had a step-up in expenses, and as we hold the line on expenses this quarter, depending upon how the mix comes out in the license and the Scores revenues, so will the guidance.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: And so the SG&A, that's where the sales folks reside, so it's not only R&D, it's in SG&A as well.
Michael J. Pung: Yes, yes. In the SG&A -- the only real variability, if you will, in the SG&A is the incentives that are tied to performance. And so if we outperform, that line item will go up, and if we perform as we expected, it'll be at or around where finished here in quarter 3.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then sort of outlook for next year. I don't know if it's sort of a run rate coming out of this year for R&D that makes sense. Maybe also SG&A makes sense. That would imply a -- how do you guys view margins? I mean, that might imply sort of flattish margins. Or is it something we should expect that you guys are earnest enough about spending that you're going to get after that investment and maybe compress margins as we head into next year?
Michael J. Pung: Yes, so we're, like many, in the budgeting cycle right now, and so we're not in a position to talk about next year yet. We will in November. But one of the things I think that's been hallmark of the company here is that we manage the expenses wisely. And we wring a lot of cash out of the company, and we try to put that cash to good use. And so if you believe those things, then you'll hear from us in the fourth quarter in terms of how we plan to invest and manage the business going forward with the opportunities ahead of us.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Got you. And then just a couple on capital. You said the repo, you've got $56 million left. Is that -- did I hear that right?
William J. Lansing: Yes.
Michael J. Pung: On the authorization. On the authorization, yes, I'm sorry.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Yes, we've $6 million left on that. And will you, I presume, that you all would tend to re-up that if you keep burning away at it pretty good?
William J. Lansing: That has always been what we do, and we would anticipate doing that, although we obviously can't speak for the board. But we -- for years now, we have reauthorized every time we exhaust the existing.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: And then on the free cash flow, I think you said $25 million this quarter, $95 million or so year-to-date. Am I -- did I hear that right?
Michael J. Pung: That's right.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: And then can you -- is there -- should we -- are there going to be seasonality for that? If there's a lot of license in next quarter, should that come up a little bit?
Michael J. Pung: Well, so, usually, the license revenues typically come in the last month of the quarter. So to the degree the license revenues signed in the month of September, that probably will be sitting in AR. In this quarter, with the $25 million that we did in cash flow, our DSO went up by 3, 4 days, which is about $7 million, $8 million. And that represents the -- some of the license revenue we signed towards the end of the quarter. So my point is, it's strictly a timing issue. We actually had a fair amount of collections the first week of January that missed the cutoff, or that $25 million would've been higher. And so we kind of look at it as a trailing full quarter to kind of smooth out those sorts of items.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: And then as we look to next year, I know you're not going to give us guidance. I'm not asking for that. But is there anything that would change the cash flow growth as it -- should it mimic roughly sort of your pro forma EPS? Is there a reason that working capital might get eaten up? Or anything like that, that would cause a difference in how your just pro forma EPS might trend versus cash flow?
Michael J. Pung: No, none that we expect, just based upon what's happened to us over the year. So that's probably a good marker for you.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then this is my last question on the business. I know that you had mentioned in your prepared comments about really working on figuring out new distribution channels, particularly the -- as you SaaS-ify or make more SaaS-like some of your businesses, some more modern distribution channels. Any update on that? Any milestones that we've hit in terms of number of products we've gotten into that new mode, or interesting new conversations you're having with developers that might be using some of that functionality?
William J. Lansing: We're having -- we're in a lot of conversations right now, and I think we'll have things to announce in the near future, but we're not prepared to announce anything today.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to the presenters.
William J. Lansing: Thank you, Suzanne. This concludes today's call. Thank you, all, for joining.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2014 Q2  (2014-04-24 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Steve Weber - VP, Investor Relations and Treasurer Will Lansing - CEO, President Mike Pung - CFO, EVP
Analysts: Manav Patnaik - Barclays Bill Warmington - Wells Fargo Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc. Matthew Galinko - Sidoti
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Tanya, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fair Isaac Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Steve Weber, you may begin your conference.
Steve Weber: Thank you, Tanya. Good afternoon and thank you for joining FICO's Second Quarter Earnings Call. I'm Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike Pung. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate an understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular, in the Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO Web site or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's Web site at fico.com or on the SEC's Web site at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through April 24, 2015. Now I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
Will Lansing: Thanks Steve. Today we announced the results for our second quarter of fiscal 2014. I will briefly recap those results, talk about the progress we are making with the FICO analytics cloud and discuss some important recent announcements we have made. In our second quarter, we reported revenues of $185 million, an increase of 3% over the same period last year. On a GAAP basis, we delivered $21 million of net income and earnings of $0.59 per share for the quarter versus $18 million and $0.51 per share from the same period last year. We delivered $29 million of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS of $0.81 per share increases of 13% and 17% respectively from the same period last year. We had a very good bookings quarter delivering $109 million of new deals, the highest single quarter's since 2011. Mike will provide more detail on the numbers. But first, I will discuss some of the things we have been working on. We continue to make progress with the FICO analytics cloud. We signed several deals this quarter that will begin contributing recurring revenues in the next few quarters. These deals involve customers that required SaaS delivery, opportunities that we previously could not have competed for. Though, we are in early stage of rollout, we have already signed about $10 million of future SaaS revenue. In March, we announced the acquisition of InfoCentricity, a private software-as-a-service based predictive analytics company. With this acquisition, we are able to put the most sophisticated cloud-based analytics modeling tools into the hands of the entire spectrum of users, from first time modelers and seasoned business analysts up through advanced data scientists and the most demanding analytics professionals. FICO now has the industries broadest offering for predictive analytics modeling available in the cloud and on premise. We also announced last week that we have acquired technology from Karmasphere that will significantly broaden our big data capabilities while increasing the market appeal from the FICO analytics cloud. Karmasphere is a self-serviced product for analyzing data on Hadoop. In the world of big data analytics, easy-of-use is critical because one of the biggest impediments to the wide-scale adoption of big data analytics is the complexity of using Hadoop to discover and apply business insight from various types and sizes of data sets. This is why you hear so much about big data being over hyped. The fact is that the potential big data is quite real, but the number of experts who are capable of performing Hadoop analytics is tiny compared to the demand. Now, with the integration of Karmasphere's collaborative, intuitive and self-service application into the FICO analytic cloud entire teams of analysts and business users will find it possible to transform their businesses using big data on Hadoop. So essentially, while this transaction was small, the implications are big. FICO is simplifying the complexity of Hadoop and putting the power of big data analytics into the hands of all the people who can really use it. Neither InfoCentricity nor Karmasphere will have a material impact on our fiscal 2014 financial results. Yet, they are both important building blocks for the FICO analytics cloud and will enable more rapid adoption by a wider array of customers. We also announced important new program in our sports business, FICO Custom Credit Education. You recall last year, we introduced the FICO Open Access program, which allowed any lender to share the FICO's score with their customers at no additional cost. That program has taken off and this new companion program goes a step further. Lenders can now purchase the entire portfolio of valuable FICO tools and content. With FICO Custom Credit Education lenders can provide their customers with their richest set of tools in the marketplace to improve their financial literacy. Tools like the FICO Score Simulator, Personalized Credit Analysis and Comparisons to FICO's Score High Achievers and FICO Score monitoring and alerts. Early response from lenders has been extremely positive and we are currently in discussions with numerous large institutions to deliver either Open Access, Custom Credit Education or both. We also announced that we will release FICO Score 9, the next version of the FICO Score beginning this summer. With this latest version, we have devised an innovative approach to developing FICO 9 Score that enables us to leapfrog our own industry standard benchmark. FICO Score 9 will be the first release in the suite that updated a new FICO Scores. It will be followed by industry-specific FICO Scores for credit cards, auto loans and mortgages. Future scores in the suite will build on FICO's deep expertise and analyzing on broad spectrum of data types as well as the keen understanding of client needs. These scores will be developed to reliably access the credit worthiness of even more people. Taken together these initiatives are examples of what we are doing to realize FICO's potential. I continue to believe that FICO has a strong portfolio of products and loyal customers by making very selective investments in innovation such as these; we can give an additional boost to our growth trajectory. I will now turn the call over to Mike for further financial details.
Mike Pung: Thank you, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. Today I will emphasize three points in my prepared comments. First our revenue this quarter was $185 million, a 3% increase from last year. Our scores business grew 9%, our tools business grew 22% and our applications business was down about 1% from the prior year. Second, we delivered $21 million of GAAP net income and $29 million of non-GAAP net income. Our free cash flow was $44 million for the quarter. Finally, we repurchased about $40 million of stock this quarter which exhausted our previous $150 million authorization and announced today Board approval for a new $150 million authorization. I will break the revenues down into three reporting segments. Starting with applications, revenues were $116 million down 1% versus the same period last year and up 3% versus last quarter. We delivered growth in collections and recovery up 22% from the same period last year, in mobility up 20% and in originations up 12%. These gains were offset by fraud banking revenues, which were down from the same period last year due to lower license sales. While total applications revenue were down slightly versus last year, we did have much higher bookings in that segment. The $79 million dollars of bookings this quarter is up 18% over last year and is the largest quarter for applications bookings we have done in the last 10 quarters. In the tool segment, revenues were $22 million up 22% versus the prior year. The growth this quarter is driven by models and optimization tools. We also had a good bookings quarter and tools up from the prior quarter and up 123% from the same quarter last year. And finally, our score segment continues to perform well. Revenues were $48 million up 9% from the same period last year and up 1% from last quarter. On the B2C side, we were up 11% versus the same period a year ago and up 8% versus last quarter. The B2B revenues were up 8% from the same quarter last year largely due to a royalty true-up and down 1% compared with last quarter when we had a large global FICO score deal. Looking at our revenues by region, this quarter 72% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region, our EMEA region generated 20% and the remaining 8% was from Asia Pacific. Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter represented 71% of total revenues. Consulting and implementation revenues were 19% of total and licensed revenues were 10% of total revenue. Turning now to bookings, we generated $21 million of current period revenues on bookings of $109 million 20% yield. The weighted average term for our bookings was 28 months this quarter. Of the $109 million in bookings 18% relates to collections and recovery, 15% to marketing solutions, 14% to banking fraud solutions and 10% to origination solutions. We had 21 booking deals in excess of $1 million, 9 of which exceeded $3 million. Transactional and maintenance bookings were 34% of total this quarter, professional services bookings were 38% of total and finally licensed bookings were 28% in the quarter. Turning to expenses, operating expenses totaled $147 million this quarter compared to $149 million in the prior quarter down $2 million. We expect operating expenses to increase modestly over the next several quarters. As you can see in our Reg G schedule, non-GAAP operating margin was 27% for the second quarter unchanged from last quarter. GAAP net income, this quarter was $21 million versus $17 million in the prior quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $29 million versus $26 million in the prior quarter. The effective tax rate was about 33.7% this quarter. We expect the effective rate to continue to be 34% to 36% for the full year unless the R&D credit is reinstated before the end of the year. The free cash flow for the quarter was $44 million or 24% of revenue compared to $31 million or 18% of revenues in the prior year. Fiscal year-to-date, we delivered $69 million of free cash flow compared with $50 million in the first two quarters of last year. Moving on to the balance sheet, we have $108 million in cash on the balance sheet. This is up $12 million from last quarter due to increases in cash generated from operations offset by our share repurchases. Our total debt is $483 million with a weighted average interest rate of 5.7%. We now have $28 million balance on our $200 million revolving credit facility. The ratio of our total net debt to adjusted EBITDA is 1.9x below the covenant level of 3x and our total fixed charge coverage ratio is at 4.9x well above the covenant level of 2.5x. During the quarter, we returned $40 million in excess cash to our investors, repurchasing about 750,000 shares at an average price of $53.40. These repurchases exhausted the $150 million that the Board authorized in August of 2012. Today, we announced the Board has authorized a new $150 million stock repurchase program. We continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. We also evaluate opportunities to acquire relevant technologies and products that advance our strategy or strengthen our portfolio on competitive position. Finally, I would like to review and reaffirm our full year guidance. As a reminder, for fiscal 2014, we guided revenues between $763 million and $773 million. GAAP net income between $91 million and $94 million; GAAP earnings per share between $2.50 to $2.60; non-GAAP net income between $125 million to $128 million; and non-GAAP EPS of $3.46 to $3.56 per share. Two quarters into our fiscal year, we are not yet half a way to our guided revenues numbers. So a natural question maybe, what do we expect will change in the back half to get to our numbers? We do remain confident. And our confidence stems from revenue flows on deals that we have already signed along with additional matured deals in our pipeline. So let me provide you a bridge to our revenue guidance range. We reported $370 million of revenue in the first half of this year. So to achieve our guidance range, we need to repeat the first half plus an additional $23 million of revenue. Approximately $15 million of this additional revenue will waterfall from deals we have already signed with our customers. These include services revenue we expect to earn related to recent bookings. And in addition, we will be claiming revenue on previously sold annual term licenses in the next two quarters. The remaining $8 million of additional revenue is consistent with what we have historically seen in the back of our year. This revenue comes from both license sales and associated services generated from matured deals we see in our pipeline and expect to sign in the back half of the year. As always, we will exercise discipline at controlling costs and we will remain highly focused on producing strong cash flow. With that, I will turn the call back to Steve for Q&A.
Steve Weber: Thanks Mike. This concludes our prepared remarks and we're ready now to take any questions. Tanya, please open the lines.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is open.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays: Hey, good evening gentlemen. I have a quick question in terms of looking at the M&A strategy and how that's evolved, Will, you have obviously, worked at this now for two years you have made a lot of good sort of tuck-in technology type deals. I was just wondering what the appetite is to do something a little more significant a game changing and just sort of make a bigger impact in terms of diversifying the company and how you think of it with respect to that.
Will Lansing: Yes. Good question. I would say that our M&A strategy has not changed dramatically. I think you will see us continue to do technology tuck-ins as appropriate where we find pockets of talent in technology and IP that are really synergistic of what we are doing especially around decision management platform and pipeline over the cloud. But, I wouldn't confine it just to those areas. And at the same time, we are always on the look out for bigger, more game changing acquisitions. That said, we remain as conservative as we have always been in terms of evaluating those kinds of acquisitions. And that's not to say we wouldn't do one but it have to meet a pretty high hurdle. We have to be very confident that it's going to advance our business in a pretty material way. And certainly for us to take any dilution, we have to have very high expectations for the return that we will get. As always we evaluate everything against the alternative of buying back own shares and because we are so confident in the brightness of our future that's a high hurdle too. So we absolutely look at bigger deals all the time. I mean its very much within our scope and it remains to be seem whether we are going to build one or not, but we are always looking.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays: Okay. Fair enough. And just on the scores business maybe can we get a quick update on sort of what the mix there in terms of looking at the different end markets like credit cards, autos and so forth. And are there any early signs that you guys maybe picking up with the economy improving that could be sort of an early read on – if that can start gaining some real good momentum there?
Mike Pung: Sure Manav. So this is Mike. We had a very – once again a pretty solid quarter across our scores business on both the consumer and on the B2B side. As it relates to the mix of our business, any comparison to last year, we saw our marketing or acquisitions scores grow pretty dramatically. The volume grew from last year roughly 20% volume. Much of that volume was coming from the card side of the business. The bank card as opposed to last year, our business was more driven from originations in new mortgages. So the increase on the acquisition side on cards were about to offset by the decline in the mortgage refinancing and on the origination side – we saw – we look at our business. So one great solid quarter. And time will tell us if those acquisition scores ultimately originate and open up new accounts.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays: Okay. Fair enough. All right. That's all I have. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Bill Warmington - Wells Fargo: Good afternoon, everyone.
Will Lansing: Hey, Bill.
Bill Warmington - Wells Fargo: I have a couple of questions for you. The first if you could talk a little bit about what's behind the strength in application in terms of what's changed, why now you are seeing this sudden surge on the application side?
Will Lansing: Yes. So over the past three, four quarters now we have had a very long cycle for getting deals completed mainly in the U.S. banks and then the U.S. markets. Some of the deals that have been held up in the sales cycle since last year are starting to sign. And we are starting to see of that in the form of bookings and some of that as part of the revenue that we reported this quarter. But, that cycle is kind of continuing to push. So we have seen a little bit of that backlog come through. We're also seeing some very nice strong services deals for companies that are upgrading to our current version of a product. And so generally, when a company upgrades to a current version, they get that version through the maintenance they have been paying and they hire us to come in and help install, and implement. And so we have a fairly healthy backlog of implementation service that's embedded in part of these deals.
Bill Warmington - Wells Fargo: Okay. And then I wanted to ask about how quickly you plan to implement this buy back?
Will Lansing: How quickly that we plan to implement it?
Bill Warmington - Wells Fargo: Implement the buyback, just something where you just going to basically match it to cash flow quarter-by-quarter, or is it something you will take on from additional leverage to accelerate?
Mike Pung: We generally are sitting with the pretty decent position of cash on the balance sheet and we also obviously have access to take on a little leverage on the line of credit. We took a little bit last quarter. The buyback program itself, we are just – we are quite regular buyers of the program and so the rate and pace that we have been buying the past is all depending upon alternative cash needs. So I wouldn't say there is a time we are going to turn it on and turn it off. It's just an ongoing program for us and we just assess it with the cash flow in the near term and other alternative uses for.
Bill Warmington - Wells Fargo: Okay. And then I had a question for about FICO 9, and why switch to FICO 9 now, what drives the adoption?
Will Lansing: Well, we are constantly looking at improving on the technology that we have out in the marketplace. And just as FICO 8 replaced the scores that preceded that, we have the next generation of scores coming. This has been in the works actually for several years and so why now, I mean why not now. It is a regular thing for us to move generationally from one score to the next and we do it with tremendous caution because FICO 8 obviously has very wide spread adoption that we want to do in a way that's not disruptive to the marketplace. But there is – the beauty of the way we are going at it is – that it is both backwards compatible for people who have FICO 8 in place. And there are opportunities for more kinds of customization for our bank customers who want to do other things that they weren't able to do before.
Bill Warmington - Wells Fargo: Okay. And then a final question for you on the score side of the business in terms of the demand that you are seeing for scores for pre-screening for banks and credit card use. How are you finding the banks appetite at this point, as it started, are you starting to see a lift there, it sounded with a pick up in volume that you referenced, answer that would be yes, but I wanted to just ask that.
Will Lansing: The answer to that is yes.
Bill Warmington - Wells Fargo: Okay. Well, thank you very much.
Mike Pung: Thanks Bill. Thanks.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your next one comes from Brett Huff from Stephens, Inc. Your line is open.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions.
Will Lansing: Hi, Brett.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: One follow-up on the applications question that was asked earlier, did you – I didn't – I'm not sure if I heard it in the prepared comments that if you broke down which of the applications are providing some of that growth, which of the deals or what variety of deals are coming through. And I guess, my question is both which product and what's the delivery mechanism, is it typically license or some other deals I know you have been developing some SaaS versions of those products. Can you give us – just characterize that for us?
Mike Pung: Let me walk you through that from my portion of the script here. This is Mike. So the growth on the application side came through first collections and recovery which is our Debt Manager 9 product. And all the versions of Debt Manager that are out in the marketplace, those are typically licensed revenues, so the term license is signed and we claim it up front. We were up 22% from the prior year. The second area of strength on the application side was in mobility, which is what we gained when we acquired Adeptra, little over a year-and-a-half ago. Mobility is a ratable model. And its all subscription based. So first shows up in the booking and then once live it shows up in an ongoing revenue stream that we call transactional. That was up 20% over the prior year. And finally, origination, our Originations Manager product, which was up 12% over the prior year. The originations product is also generally more of a licensed based term, licensed based product. Though the SaaS revenues that Will was describing which are going to yield future revenue to us are going to come in a ratable model. Did that help?
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: That's helpful. Yes. That's great. Thank you.
Mike Pung: Okay.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: And then just kind of a follow up question to the SaaS question, I know you developed various SaaS versions of some of the products you have developed – some of them developed, some of them. Can you give us just a status update of where are we are on that, what any more in or how do you want to characterize it to us that's a big part of the story for FICO right now. I want to just get an update on that.
Will Lansing: I don't know exactly what anything you call it, the products are there. They have been made available as services and we are just starting to sell them now. The market is increasingly interested in it maybe faster than we even expect it. And we have done our first few SaaS deals where we literally took the functionality that we had in the non-premise application like Originations Manager 4 and have it in the marketplace now and deals done in – on a SaaS basis with Origination Manager 4.5. That would be an example. But, we have that across the board.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: It's helpful. And then, last question for me is, the scores business any commentary on pricing or competition or any update on that front?
Will Lansing: We have to earn our wins everyday in that business. We don't take anything for granted. The appetite of our customer base for Open Access seems to be very large. And although that's not a lot of revenue that comes from Open Access, it really does help us with cementing the franchise. And we hope that the strong position in Open Access leads to additional revenue in programs like our education program – the credit education program.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. That's what I needed. Appreciate your time. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Galinko from Sidoti.
Matthew Galinko - Sidoti: Hey, thanks for taking my question.
Will Lansing: Hi, Matt.
Matthew Galinko - Sidoti: So, is there any revenue from the customer credit education program built into your fiscal 2014 guidance?
Will Lansing: No. There is not.
Matthew Galinko - Sidoti: Okay. Thanks. And then, any color you can provide around just the length in the bookings term?
Will Lansing: The length, is what you said?
Matthew Galinko - Sidoti: Yes. The length in bookings term?
Will Lansing: Oh, sorry. I didn't hear you. Yes. Normally our bookings term is usually 23 or 24 months quarter-after-quarter, little bit longer 28 months this quarter. I won't necessarily read into any about it other than we have a couple of our large deals we did 9 deals over $3 million. A couple of them have 36 and 48 month terms to it. One in particular has a four term but that was a larger deal. And so that skews a little bit of the pie.
Matthew Galinko - Sidoti: Got it. Thanks.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to the presenters.
Steve Weber: Thank you, Tanya. This concludes our call for the quarter. Thank you all for joining.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2014 Q1  (2014-01-23 11:00:00) =====
Executives: Steven P. Weber - Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer, President and Director Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Chief of Investor Relations and Executive Vice President
Analysts: Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Research Division John Campbell - Stephens Inc., Research Division Kevin O'Keefe Matthew Galinko - Sidoti & Company, LLC
Operator: Good morning. My name is Jeremy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fair Isaac Corporation Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Steve Weber. You may begin.
Steven P. Weber: Thank you, Jeremy. Good morning, thank you for joining FICO's First Quarter Earnings Call. I'm Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike Pung. Yesterday, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate an understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular, in the Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through February 23, 2014. Now I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
William J. Lansing: Thanks, Steve. First, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. We're holding our call this morning due to travel schedules. We do expect to conduct our call next quarter at our typical time of 5:00 p.m. Eastern. Today, we announced the results for our first quarter and fiscal 2014. I'll briefly recap those results and then talk about some of the exciting things we've been working on, and how we're measuring our progress. In our first quarter, we reported revenue of $184 million, a decrease of 3% over the same period last year. On a GAAP basis, we delivered $17 million of net income and earnings of $0.47 per share for the quarter versus $23 million and $0.66 per share from the same period last year. We delivered $26 million of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS of $0.73 per share, decreases of 18% and 17%, respectively, from the same period last year. These results were in line with our expectations as we had an exceptionally strong comparison with our fiscal 2013 fourth quarter. Mike will provide more detail on the numbers. But first, I'd like to update you on the progress we're making in the number of areas. We made significant progress with our cloud initiatives in the last quarter. The first part of our cloud efforts has been focused on making our applications available on a SaaS basis. We now have new software-as-a-service versions of our key products. This quarter, we sold our first 2 Origination Managers SaaS deals and a large debt manager SaaS deal. While SaaS deals don't generate upfront revenue in the quarter they are signed, they had recurring revenue in the future periods. Importantly, these deals did not cannibalize our legacy products. They were new customers that require SaaS delivery, providing early validation of our strategy of growth by exploiting new delivery channels. Mobility has become an important component of our SaaS applications and represents a growth opportunity beyond our core applications. Our Mobility offerings built around our Adeptra acquisition have expanded the utility of both on-premise and new cloud offerings. We have deployed new SaaS delivery infrastructure domestically and internationally, and we'll add to our infrastructure as demanded by the market. The second thrust in our cloud effort is to make our analytics IP available on a Platform as a Service. Where traditionally our analytic tools were available only for on-premise use, today, we can offer the most sophisticated analytic tools in the cloud environment. We call this the Decision Management platform which includes, among other things, components for developing analytic models, optimization algorithms and decision services. We also sold our first Retail Fraud Manager solution. Retail Fraud Managers are new FICO application that we developed in-house. It's targeted at retailers and key outsourcers for the retail industry, protecting them from the costly problems of returns, fraud, waste and abuse. I'm also happy to report on several developments in our Scores business. First, we announced in November a renewed multiyear agreement with Equifax, which will continue reselling FICO Scores and provide FICO access to its consumer data so we can develop and market new analytics. As part of the new agreement, FICO will now be able to sell FICO Scores directly to lenders and third party resellers. Consumers will continue to have access to their FICO Score based on Equifax credit data at myfico.com and on Equifax's consumer site. FICO Scores based on Equifax credit data will now also be made available to consumers through third parties. We also introduced our FICO Open Access program, which allows any lender to share the FICO Score with their consumers at no additional score fee, the same FICO Scores used by participating banks to manage their accounts. In addition to their FICO Score, the standard measure of U.S. consumer credit risk, these customers will see the 2 most important factors affecting their score, as well as FICO educational materials, to help them better understand credit scoring and what behavior impacts their FICO Score. Currently, we have commitments from Barclaycard US, First National Bank of Omaha, Discover and others to roll the program out to more than 35 million U.S. consumers, and we expect more banks to follow in the coming months. The program has been widely praised by consumer advocacy groups and regulators as a means to offer transparency to consumers looking to understand their credit situation. Participating banks have viewed it as a significant value add to the consumer. The FICO Score is being used to drive higher consumer engagement, higher perceived value in the banking relationship and perhaps even better consumer management behavior. We believe consumers benefit first by better understanding how lenders perceive them and second, through the extensive educational materials available to them through the Open Access program. We think consumers also benefit by understanding how the FICO Score, the score that lenders use, differs from education scores that sometimes appear on the market. We expect all of our initiatives to bear fruit as we move through 2014. We're laying the framework with these long-term programs for FICO to grow and flourish in the years ahead. We will continue to update you in the coming quarters and we'll be reporting new metrics to measure our progress, particularly as we see more SaaS customers coming on board. I'll now turn the call over to Mike for further financial details.
Michael J. Pung: Thanks, Will, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll emphasize 3 points in my prepared comments. First, our revenue this quarter was $184 million, a 3% decrease from last year. Our Scores business grew 9% and our Tools business, where we signed several large license deals that slipped from our fourth quarter, grew 15% from the prior year. Second, we delivered $17 million of GAAP net income this quarter and $26 million of non-GAAP net income. Our free cash flow was $26 million for the quarter. Finally, we repurchased about $25 million of stock this quarter, and ended the quarter with $96 million of cash with ample liquidity to pursue our investment strategy. Now I'll break the revenue down into our 3 reporting segments. And starting with Applications, revenue was $112 million, down 10% versus the same period last year. Much of our Applications growth was due to the acquisition of Adeptra, which grew 23% from last year, and CR Software, which grew 4% from last year. Declines in our Marketing Solutions business where we experienced some customer attrition earlier in fiscal 2013 and in customer management and fraud banking which had some large license sales in the previous year, offset the increase from our acquisitions. Finally, we signed several license deals that slipped in our fourth quarter with several other large deals from that period still in play. In our second segment, Tools, revenue was $25 million, up 15% versus the prior year and flat with the prior quarter. This segment continues to be an area of strength for us, which grew at double-digit rate in 2013. And finally, in our Scores segment. Revenue was $47 million, up 9% from the same period last year and up 2% from last quarter. On the B2C side, we're up 22% versus the same period a year ago, and down 3% versus last quarter. The B2B revenues were up 5% from the same quarter last year and up 4% compared with last quarter. The increase was primarily due to a global FICO Score deal we signed with a large customer in Latin America. Looking at our revenue by region. This quarter, 74% of total revenue was derived from our Americas region. Our EMEA region generated 19%, and the remaining 7% was from Asia Pacific. Recurring revenue derived from transactional and maintenance sources for quarter, represented 70% of total revenues. Consulting and implementation revenues were 19% of total revenue and license revenues were 11% of total revenue. Turning now to bookings. We generated $20 million of current period revenue on bookings of $84 million, a 24% yield. The weighted average term for our bookings was 23 months this quarter. Of the $84 million in booking, 15% relates to collections and recovery, 14% to originations solutions, and 11% to banking fraud solutions. We had 16 deals in excess of $1 million, 4 of which exceeded $3 million. Transactional and maintenance bookings were 29% of total this quarter. Professional service bookings were 55% this quarter. And finally, license bookings were 16% in the quarter. Turning to expenses. Operating expenses totaled $149 million this quarter compared to $140 million in the prior quarter, or up $9 million. The increase relates to our performance-based incentives. We also incurred a restructuring charge this quarter related to eliminating some headcount, focused on lower priority areas and plan to reinvest the savings towards higher priority investments during the year. We expect operating expenses to increase modestly over the next several quarters. As you can see in our Reg G schedule, non-GAAP operating margin was 27% for the first quarter versus 28% in the fiscal 2013. GAAP net income this quarter was $17 million versus $29 million in the prior quarter, and non-GAAP net income was $26 million versus $35 million in the prior quarter. The effective tax rate was about 37.5% this quarter, higher than the 31% we guided due to the expiration of the R&D credit, a onetime state audit adjustment, and a onetime tax adjustment related to our foreign operations. We expect the effective rate to be in about the 33% to 34% for the full year, unless the R&D credit is reinstated before the end of our fiscal year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $26 million or 14% of revenue, compared to $19 million or 10% of revenue in the prior year. Moving to the balance sheet. We have $96 million in cash on the balance sheet. This is up $13 million from last quarter due to increases in cash generated from our operations, as well as proceeds from options that were exercised, somewhat offset by share repurchases. Our total debt is $478 million, with the weighted average interest rate of 5.8%. We now have a $23 million balance on our $200 million revolving credit facility. The ratio of our total net debt to adjusted EBITDA is at 2x, which is below the covenant level of 3x. Our total fixed charge coverage ratio is at 4.7x, which is well above the covenant level of 2.5x. During the quarter, we returned $25 million in excess cash to our investors by repurchasing about 440,000 shares at an average price of $57.06 per share. We still have about $40 million remaining on our current board authorization, and continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of our cash. We also evaluate the opportunities to acquire relevant technologies and products that advance our strategy or strengthen our portfolio in competitive position. Finally, we are reiterating our previous guidance as follows: revenue range from $763 million to $773 million, GAAP net income of $91 million to $94 million and corresponding non-GAAP net income of $125 million to $128 million, GAAP EPS of $2.50 to $2.60 per share and corresponding non-GAAP EPS of $3.46 to $3.56 per share. With that, I'll turn the call back to Steve for questions and answer.
Steven P. Weber: Thanks, Mike. This concludes our prepared remarks and we're ready now to take any questions. Jeremy, please open the lines.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays.
Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Research Division: This is actually Greg calling on for Manav. I'd like to start with the Scores, which you saw a nice quarter and you said a lot came from the large Lat Am contract. Can you just talk to the momentum you've seen in credit cards and if your expectations have changed for the rest of 2014?
William J. Lansing: Yes. Thanks, Greg, and good morning. We did have a large deal in Latin America. The first in the country that we signed a deal in. As it relates to the ongoing flow of the business, we had a strong pre-screen or acquisition score quarter, almost across the board compared to the prior quarter. So we're continuing to see momentum now on acquisition scores that are being used for marketing purposes. That was somewhat offset by our higher valued online Originations score where fewer accounts were originated during the quarter. And as a result, the ongoing momentum of the business was down slightly from the prior quarter.
Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And maybe a little bit on the M&A environment here, and I know you're about a year into integrating both CR Software and Adeptra, and what you're seeing and if there's any particular niches of interest that you're focusing on?
William J. Lansing: Yes. So first, with respect to the acquisitions that we made, those are all fully integrated and running very smoothly and we're happy with all of them, have retained the management from those companies, and are really pleased about the way that goes on. In terms of M&A going forward, we're always evaluating M&A opportunity. We would love to complement our organic growth efforts with acquired growth. That said, we continue to be value conscious. Markets are -- frothy's probably too strong a word, but valuations are high. And so we remain very disciplined in the way we evaluate these things. But we're absolutely active in evaluating. The strategy has not changed. We focus on tuck-ins that extend our current core franchises. We're always open to adding a franchise if we can get it at the right value and with the right kind of growth prospects. And until that -- those are the kind of strengths that we use. Occasionally, we'll do a technology tuck-in like the Infoglide acquisition that we did. But in general, we're pretty happy with our organic technology efforts. We really have a very, very strong development team, strong engineering team and I just have an absolute factory of innovation going on here. So that winds up not being quite as much a focus for M&A.
Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Research Division: That make sense. And maybe along those lines, as you're expanding your SaaS offerings and building up the analytic cloud, how much more investing do you think needs to be done there? And are there specific areas where there's additional focus that needs to be made?
William J. Lansing: We will continue to focus there. I mean, we have been focusing there, you see it in the fact that our net income is not growing as fast as it has in prior years because we're taking that money and redeploying it into investment in our business. That's almost entirely a function of the opportunity set that we got. We like investing in stock buyback, but when we see the opportunities that we have in developing products and services organically, they're really attractive. And so we continue to invest there. I don't see that stopping in the near future. At the same time, we don't see it ramping up dramatically. I think that we're trying to strike a balance between continuing the stock repurchase, a lot of fiscal discipline, some level of investment in the business. Could we invest more in the business than we do today? We could. We could. But it would be at the expense of net income. And it would have a P&L impact that we're not happy about. So we don't do that. We're disciplined about how much we invest. But it's not going to stop either. This isn't a onetime shot and then we're done. You can expect continued investment. I mean we're building a business for the long haul here.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Huff from Stephens Inc.
John Campbell - Stephens Inc., Research Division: This is John Campbell, in for Brett Huff. Just for the EPS guide, are you guys going with a particular tax rate, or does the low end of that range assume that 44% tax rate and then just the high end assume that 33%?
Michael J. Pung: No. We're using about -- right down in the middle of it, between 33% and 34% now that the R&D credit was not renewed by the Congress.
John Campbell - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then, are you guys able to break out what percent of rev currently is categorized as SaaS, and then maybe if you could just talk about how that trends over time?
Michael J. Pung: Yes. So we typically haven't broken out what percent is SaaS, but let me give you little order of context around our business. So over the years, we've had lines of business that we have offered on a hosted basis for our customers. And we are now supplementing those hosted long-term deals with new cloud offerings. So if you lump both our hosted business and our cloud business together, on an annual basis last year, we had just over $150 million of revenue of that nature. And it's concentrated in a couple of areas, particularly in our Marketing Solutions business where we host for almost all of our customers and in our Adeptra business which, of course, is a SaaS offering for all of our customers. Outside of those 2, then we have several smaller product lines where we host or provide a SaaS offering. Kind of outside of our environment, of course, we have long had the national processors host and run our TRIAD and broad products for us. And there's another $80-or-so million of business that's being hosted in a cloud, not by FICO for our customers, but by our partners, the processors. So we have a fairly extensive experience in this area through our legacy hosted businesses.
John Campbell - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And then just last one for us. The CapEx kind of came in, I guess, relatively light this quarter. Is that anything to read into the rest of the year?
Michael J. Pung: No, not really. Our CapEx is typically around $20 million to $25 million a year. And it ebbs and flows with the investments that we make internally in the technology. And we would anticipate our full year CapEx to be pretty similar to what it was last year. It's more of the timing.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Kevin O'Keefe from Brown Advisory.
Kevin O'Keefe: Just to follow up on the SaaS point that the previous caller was making, is there any way you can quantify what the dollar impact you had anticipated going forward from the deals that you signed this quarter?
Michael J. Pung: Yes. So Kevin, thanks for calling in. This is Mike. So we haven't been, right now, quantifying our SaaS deal separately. This is the first quarter we signed deals both on the Originations side and the Debt Manager side. They basically are compiled as part of the bookings right now and rolled forward in the guidance that we provided. The size of these deals are in the $1 million plus range over a multiyear period of time. And so we don't expect this to have a material impact -- these 3 deals to have a material impact for us. We would anticipate as we start to grow the book of business that is SaaS, as the market starts to migrate for us into that direction, that we'll be providing more specific information on the legacy business in comparison to the SaaS business. But right now, it's not large enough for us to break out and not meaningful enough for the investors to trend forward.
Kevin O'Keefe: Got you. And we all appreciate that additional break out. The reason I ask is -- on the application side, 2 of your 3 businesses did outstanding this quarter. But the upside, I feel like we've been waiting a few quarters for a large number of deferred contract revenue. I think following the CR and the Adeptra acquisitions, we would have expected higher rouse flowing through on the upside. And since your guidance is unchanged. It seems like it's still kind of in the cards, but I'd love to hear if -- kind of what's driving lower revs right now and what the outlook is moving forward?
William J. Lansing: I think that it still is in the cards. I think it's safe to assume that Applications business will look a little bit stronger. But the deals on that side, their license deals, they tend to be lumpier. The timing is a little bit trickier. The sales cycle is long, and so I wouldn't read too much into one quarter.
Kevin O'Keefe: So you anticipate the deals that have been on hold dating to the last summer still in the pipeline, it's not that they haven't closed and -- or they have closed and other business deteriorated, they just had the sales cycles been extended?
William J. Lansing: Yes. I would -- I think that's a fair summary.
Kevin O'Keefe: Okay. And just one more if you don't mind, we're really pleased to see you guys back in the market buying your stock back. And I think prior indications have been, in the absence of acquisitions, your preference is to use cash flow to buy in your stock. I'm just curious, how much capacity you have if you did happen to see an acquisition that you found attractive. Could you do it? Or would you -- do you need to replenish your cash on your balance sheet before you think about other acquisitions?
William J. Lansing: We could do it. We have capacity with our line and with cash on hand and with cash from operations to do a reasonably significant acquisition. And I would say never say never if using paper, although it's -- you know how we feel about it. We value it so much. We're busy buying it in. So it would have to be something reasonably remarkable for us to issue paper to do. But we have the capacity without -- to do a pretty meaningful acquisition without issuing any stock.
Kevin O'Keefe: That's great to hear. And so -- if I think about your thoughts on capital management, is it safe to say that you think about free cash flow as the engine to purchase in stock, and then you have the flexibility at this point to do a deal and lever up modestly if you have to?
William J. Lansing: That's exactly right.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Galinko from Sidoti.
Matthew Galinko - Sidoti & Company, LLC: So I'm just curious if you could show anymore color around the cloud bookings in terms of the duration of those. Is it -- can you say if it's greater than sort of the overall bookings term or less?
Michael J. Pung: Slightly greater, Matthew. The overall booking term was about 2 years. This is -- the SaaS offerings in here were slightly longer than that.
Matthew Galinko - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay. And can we sort of read into that being moving up then in the future or not necessarily the case?
Michael J. Pung: Well, our objective is we're taking these products to market, is to line up a multiyear deal, much like we do with our other on-premise products. And be able to build in a ratable revenue streams that are -- that come along with these product lines. Customers may react differently but because of the nature of a lot of our products, we don't believe it'll be unusual for many of them to have multiyear periods. Though I'm quite certain there'll be customers who will go by year-to-year. So the market will begin to dictate that for us as we further penetrate it.
Matthew Galinko - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay. And then, another question is around the Open Access move. How do you sort of view that in terms of opportunity versus cannibalization of the B2C Scores business?
William J. Lansing: We see it as -- we have not seen any cannibalization. We don't anticipate cannibalization there. We think there's a lot of opportunity. Obviously, it raises consumer awareness of the FICO Score. As you all know, there are a lot of non-FICO Scores with similar score ranges that are being sold out in marketplace that are most typically not the scores being used by lenders to make their credit decisions. It causes confusion. And frankly it's not great for the FICO brand. And so, the Open Access program lets us really put the FICO brand front and center, in front of the consumer. It lets -- the banks use the same score that they're using to make a better decision. It lets them disclose that with no additional cost to the consumer. And we think that raising that awareness has long-term benefits for us. One, it keeps the banks happier with using FICO Scores, but that's kind of the obvious one. Well, we also think that in the long run, it's going to create opportunities for us in our consumer Scores business. And so we do hope over time to capitalize on the broader consumer awareness.
Operator: And we have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Weber.
Steven P. Weber: Thanks, Jeremy. This concludes our call today. Thank you all for joining.
Operator: And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Ryan, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fair Isaac Corporation Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn our call over to Steve Weber. You may begin.
Steven P. Weber: Thank you, Ryan. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining FICO's Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. I'm Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike Pung. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the runway of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular, in the risk factors and forward-looking statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through November 29, 2013. Now, I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
William J. Lansing: Thanks, Steve. Today, we announced the results for our fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. I'll briefly recap those results and summarize our entire fiscal year 2013, then I'll discuss our outlook for 2014. In our fourth quarter, we reported revenue of $190 million, an increase of 2% over the same period last year. On a GAAP basis, we delivered $29 million of net income and earnings of $0.79 per share for the quarter, up 38% and 32%, respectively, from the same period last year. We delivered $35 million of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS of $0.98 per share, increases of 17% from the same period last year. Recurring revenues throughout our business were strong again this quarter, up 4% over the same quarter last year. Services revenue were 8% higher than last year. We were disappointed this quarter with license sales, which were 12% lower than the same period last year. Our customers continue to face uncertainties that have lengthened purchasing decisions for large license transactions. We had several very large deals this quarter that, had we closed them before September 30, would've yielded a different result for the quarter. While these deals are still in play, we've learned that in today's environment, it's difficult to forecast the timing of large deal approvals at North American banks. Mike will provide more detail on the numbers, but first, I'd like to summarize what we accomplished in fiscal 2013, particularly since our Q4 results do not tell the whole story. A year ago, I said we viewed fiscal 2013 as a year in which we would continue to invest in long-term growth initiatives. First, we would diversify beyond our strong foundation in financial services, where analytics have generated great value; second, we would expand our SaaS offerings with cloud-enabled FICO applications, analytics and solutions; and third, we would help our clients leverage Big Data to make better decisions and change the way they do business. We've made great strides toward these goals in the past year. We've successfully integrated the IP and talent we gained when we acquired Adeptra. We closed the year with several large wins as a direct result of our new mobile customer engagement capability. We acquired and integrated CR Software, giving our Debt Manager product the functionality it needed to regain its position as the most advanced offering in a growing market, and at the same time, giving us firm footing in several new industries. Both of these acquisitions boosted our revenue, accounting for much of our growth this year and also our bookings. And they helped us diversify beyond financial services, particularly in government and insurance bookings this year. We will see the benefits of these investments in the months and years ahead. But we've also worked hard internally on innovation. We stepped up our development efforts in the area of enterprise fraud prevention, which is a growing problem for our customers, and we expect will be a significant growth driver for the business. We focus significant resources on the specific market problems of application fraud, online fraud and merchant monitoring fraud. In addition, we continue to deliver solid performance from our Scores franchise. Our B2C business grew 16% from the prior year as we introduced new consumer product offerings. And perhaps most significantly, this year, we began the rollout of the FICO Analytic Cloud, a game-changing offering enabling businesses of any size to access the industry's most powerful Big Data analytics and Decision Management technology. The Cloud will deliver a wide range of benefits, one of which is cutting analytic application development time from months to days. It's an exciting offering, and we'll have more specific announcements on this within a matter of weeks. But 2013 hasn't been without bumps in the road. We're still heavily concentrated in the financial services industry, and therefore subject to the uncertainties of that industry as it recovers and contends with new levels of regulation. We continue to see fluctuations in our revenues that are linked to the signing of large license deals. As we move towards more subscription-based agreements with our customers, we expect license volatility to diminish as it represents a smaller portion of our total revenues. But in the meantime, we're mindful of the realities our customers are facing and of the short-term effects on our own revenues. That said, we remain very confident about the future. When I became CEO nearly 2 years ago, I said that what makes FICO different from other companies is that we have great technology, with a proven track record. And in many ways, the market for that technology is just getting warmed up. FICO Analytic products transform entire industries, and in the era of Big Data, there are many industries left to transform. I'll talk more about what I see for us in 2014, but first, I'll turn the call over to Mike for further financial details.
Michael J. Pung: Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll emphasize 3 points in my prepared comments. First, our revenue this quarter was $190 million, an increase from last year that was primarily driven by our acquisitions. Second, we delivered $29 million of GAAP net income this quarter and $90 million for the year. We delivered $35 million of non-GAAP net income and $122 million for the year. Free cash flow was $32 million for the quarter and $109 million for the full year. Finally, we repurchased about $35 million of stock this quarter, for a total of $85 million for the full year, and ended the quarter with $83 million of cash and improved leverage from last year. I'll break the revenue down into our 3 reporting segments. Starting with Applications, revenue was $119 million, down 1% versus the same period last year, but up 4% from last quarter. Much of the increase from the prior year was due to the acquisitions of Adeptra and CR Software, which accounted for about $23 million of revenue this quarter. The rest of the portfolio declined over the same period last year, primarily due to decreases in our Marketing Solutions business, where we experienced some customer attrition this year; and in Customer Management, which had some very large license sales in the prior year. For the year, Applications revenue was $476 million, up 12% from the prior year. In the second segment, Tools, revenue was $25 million, up 29% versus the prior year and 16% versus the prior quarter. For the year, Tools revenue was $87 million, up 14% from last year. This segment has been a particular area of strength for us, and this is the second straight year we've driven double-digit growth. And third, in our Scores segment, revenue was $46 million, down 1% from the same period last year, when we had a large one-time project, and down 2% from last quarter. On the B2C side, we're up 27% versus the same period a year ago, and 3% versus last quarter. And on the B2B side, revenues were down 8% from the same quarter last year, with the decline mainly due to the large project, and B2B revenue was down 4% compared to the last quarter. For the year, Scores revenue was $181 million, up 3% from last year. Looking at our revenue by region, this quarter's 71% of total revenue was derived from our Americas region. Our EMEA region generated 20%, and the remaining 9% was from Asia Pacific. Recurring revenue, which is derived from transactional and maintenance sources, for the quarter represented 68% of total revenues. Consulting and implementation revenues were 19% of total, and license revenues were 13% of total. During the quarter, we recorded $25 million of license revenue versus $22 million in the prior quarter, with the increase driven by the Tools business. Turning now to bookings, we generated $26 million of current period revenue on bookings of $91 million, a 29% yield. The weighted average term for our bookings was 22 months this quarter. For the year, we generated $328 million of bookings, up 12% from the previous year. Of the $91 million in bookings this quarter, 16% related to collections and recovery, 14% to banking fraud solutions and 12% to Customer Management solutions. We had 18 booking deals in excess of $1 million, 3 of which exceeded $3 million. Transactional and maintenance bookings were 40% of total this quarter. Services bookings were 41% this quarter. Finally, license bookings were 19% of the total. Turning now to expenses. Operating expenses totaled $140 million this quarter, compared to $149 million in the prior quarter, or down $9 million. The decline is primarily related to a decrease in performance-based incentives. We expect operating expenses to increase modestly over the next several quarters. As you can see on our Reg G schedule, non-GAAP operating margin was 32% for the fourth quarter, versus 25% in the prior quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin was 28% for the year, compared to 30% last year. The initial margins associated with the acquired product lines are lower than historical FICO margins. However, as we expected, we are beginning to see those margins improve as we fully realize expense synergies and grow these businesses. GAAP net income this quarter was $29 million, versus $20 million in the prior quarter, and non-GAAP net income was $35 million, versus $29 million in the prior quarter. The effective tax rate was about 33% this quarter, up slightly due to the geographical mix of profits, and we expect the effective tax rate to be about 31% for the full year 2014. Free cash flow for the quarter was $32 million or 17% of revenue, compared to $27 million or 15% of revenue in the prior quarter. For the year, our free cash flow was $109 million, compared with $101 million in the prior year. Moving on to the balance sheet. We had $83 million in cash and marketable securities. This is down $10 million from last quarter, due to share repurchases and debt retirement and offset by increases in the cash we generated from our operations. Our total debt is at $470 million, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.9%. We now have $15 million balance on our $200 million revolving credit facility. The ratio of our total net debt to adjusted EBITDA is 2x, below the covenant level of 3x, and our total fixed charge coverage ratio is at 4.7x, well above the covenant level of 2.5x. During the quarter, we returned $35 million in excess cash to our investors through our stock repurchase plan. And during October, we repurchased an additional $15 million for a total of about 1 million shares at an average price of $53.35. We still have about $50 million remaining on the current board authorization and continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. We also evaluate opportunities to acquire relevant technologies and products that advance our strategy or strengthen our portfolio and competitive position. With that, I'll turn the call back to Will for his thoughts on fiscal '14.
William J. Lansing: Thanks, Mike. As I said earlier, I'm pleased with where we've positioned ourselves for the future. We have a solid installed base with good recurring revenue. Our Scores business continues to perform very well in a slow growth economy. Our acquisitions are fully integrated and performing well. And we are rolling out innovations, including cloud-enabled applications, that we believe are highly competitive and well-suited to meeting the needs of our customers. At the same time, we recognize the uncertainties in the markets we serve, particularly in the financial services sector. With all this in mind, we're opting to be cautious in the guidance we're offering for fiscal '14. We expect revenue to be between $763 million and $773 million, an increase of 3% to 4% versus fiscal '13. We expect net income to be $91 million to $94 million, up 1% to 4% over fiscal '13. And non-GAAP net income to be $125 million to $128 million, up 3% to 5% over fiscal '13. Finally, we expect GAAP earnings per share of $2.50 to $2.60, up 1% to 5% over fiscal '13; and non-GAAP EPS of $3.46 to $3.56, up 3% to 6% over fiscal '13. I'll turn the call back now to Steve for Q&A.
Steven P. Weber: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we're ready now to take your questions. Ryan, please open the lines.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Could you just give us the acquisition contribution on the top line this quarter? And then, I guess, how much is incorporated into the '14 guidance? I know it should be minimal, but I just wanted to ask.
Michael J. Pung: Yes, Manav, this is Mike. So in the fourth quarter, we had about $22.5 million of revenue coming from CR Software and Adeptra. That's in the fiscal '13 numbers. Next year, we're not breaking out the numbers for either of those 2 business lines, but we're expecting to grow them at about the same pace we grew them this year, which is double-digit for CR Software and around 20-some percent for Adeptra.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And maybe if you can elaborate just a little bit more, Will, you mentioned around your guidance incorporating some of the, I guess, prudency just in the context of the market. How do you realistically see that shaping up? And maybe how much of a discount you guys have taken for that?
William J. Lansing: Well, I think we're being prudent because we just came off a quarter where we didn't meet expectations in terms of our guidance. And so I think it's natural for us to be prudent under those circumstances. We are feeling really good about our business and about the appetite of bank customers and non-financial institutions customers for the analytics products that we have. We're -- we feel good about what we think will be increasing uptake for our applications when they're offered on a SaaS basis, as well as on-premise versions. So we feel good about the product portfolio and where we're going. I think we have the uncertainty in the marketplace that comes with the financial services industry. And I think your guess is as good as anyone's guess as to where that takes us. I think things are getting better, but we're being cautious.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then just a last one for me. In terms of the M&A pipeline, I mean, you guys weren't, I guess, as active this quarter in the buyback front. But just curious on the M&A pipeline there and just your thoughts around it. I mean, you guys obviously did quite a bit over the last 12 months, but sort of slowed down recently. Just wanted to get your views there.
William J. Lansing: Sure. We think about using our shareholders' cash for multiple things. We think about it, first and foremost, for stock buyback, which is a wonderful return to the shareholders and has the virtue of tremendous certainty. It competes -- that share buyback competes with M&A opportunity. We have a lot of M&A opportunity, we're -- but we evaluate acquisition targets with a very high bar because we're pretty bullish on our own prospects. And so it really takes a very compelling story for us to be interested in acquiring another business. And so our pipeline is full. There's lots of things to evaluate and consider, and it would -- it should not surprise anyone if in the course of 2014 we do additional acquisitions. But at the same time, one could easily imagine us going through 2014 and not buying a single company. I think it's all circumstances dependent, and we continue to evaluate these acquisitions against a very high bar. We also have the benefit of a tremendously strong product development organization at FICO. And so we are often faced with situations where we see interesting acquisitions that have an immediate revenue benefit and sometimes are accretive relatively quickly. But they're costly. And we've set those against building it ourselves, and we have -- we just have tremendous bench strength in terms of building our own product, and we did a lot of it this year. When you look at FICO Analytic Cloud and Decision Management platforms, some of the things that we've announced, some of the things that are coming to the market right now, these are things we chose to build rather than buy. They do compete for P&L dollars, and we're comfortable with that. We try to balance it. There's a point where we invest to a point and no further, but we're making fairly significant organic investments in the business right now, and a large part of that is because we can build so much more cost effectively than buy. So that's a very long way of saying we have lots of acquisition opportunity, but held to a very high bar.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Galinko from Sidoti & Company.
Matthew Galinko - Sidoti & Company, LLC: I guess first, just if you could expand a little bit, I know you mentioned we should expect OpEx to come up a little bit in the coming quarters. Can you just highlight some areas of focus there? Is headcount going to be coming off, if it's going to be focused mostly on R&D? And any specific products we should be focusing on?
Michael J. Pung: Yes, so we are expecting our OpEx on a run rate basis to come up modestly from quarter 4. Quarter 4 included -- or actually excluded some of the performance-based incentives that had been in our run rate up for the first 9 months. And so it was a light quarter simply because our bonus and our commission accruals are lighter than what they had been in previous quarters. We expect that to get reset in the first of this year. Headcount is remaining fairly flat on a quarter-to-quarter basis. In fact, most of the headcount increase over last year came from the acquisitions that we had done. So I would expect, Matt, to see a little bit of increase across each of the 3 line items on our P&L for commissions and incentives, and probably a little bit more materials cost in our cost of revenue as we see further growth of the Adeptra product, and that comes along with a little higher COGS to it.
Matthew Galinko - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Great. And then just one other one, on B2C, obviously, was a very strong quarter. I'm just curious, how much of that was a result of putting Experian in, and how much of that was just sort of the business growing on its own?
William J. Lansing: It was a combination. I'd say it was a little bit more of our ability to sell the 3-in-1 product than other factors, but there were a lot of other factors. That business is performing very nicely today. There's market appetite. Our marketing efforts have gotten a lot stronger, our product continues to improve everyday and it's generally becoming a much more competitive offering. And so it's -- I would say it's a combination.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Brett Horn from Morningstar.
Brett Horn - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: I was wondering, in the Scores area, I was wondering if you could tell me or give me some color on how sensitive that area potentially is to residential mortgage volumes? Was the dropoff in refis a driver at all in the fourth quarter? And do you see that as any kind of headwind going into the next year?
Michael J. Pung: Yes, Brett, so most of our Scores business is tied to the volumes associated with credit cards. Though a very important component of it are mortgages, including refinancing, as well as the auto industry. Throughout most of the year, we've seen strength continue on the mortgage side, though it certainly has tapered off from where it was earlier on in the year. Auto seems to continue to be performing actually quite strong, though it is a smaller part of our B2B business. Credit cards was generally pretty consistent and flat with last year -- I'm sorry, last quarter, which had been in a growth area over the first 3 quarters of the year. So mortgages is an important piece. It's dropped maybe slightly. It's been offset by auto. And overall, the net of it is our Scores business is performing at a pretty high level.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We have no further questions on the line.
William J. Lansing: Thank you, and thank you all for joining and we'll talk to you again next quarter.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

I'm Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike Pung. Today, we issued a press release that describes the financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate an understanding of the runway of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular, in the risk factors and forward-looking statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through August 30, 2013. Now, I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
William J. Lansing: Thanks, Steve. Today, we announced the results for our third quarter of fiscal 2013. I'll briefly recap those results, talk about the performance of our different segments and give our view on the macro environment. In our third quarter, we reported revenue of $184 million, an increase of 15% over the same period last year. On a GAAP basis, we delivered $20 million of net income and earnings of $0.54 per share for the quarter, down 5% and 8%, respectively, from the same period last year. The GAAP results included a noncash tax charge of $0.07 per share. We delivered $29 million of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS of $0.80 per share, increases of 14% and 10%, respectively, from the same period last year. Recurring revenues throughout our business were strong again this quarter. We are pleased with the continued momentum we're seeing in our Scores business, which I'll discuss in a minute. One area of disappointment is the lengthening of the license sales cycle, particularly among North American banks. While we still feel the size and quality of our pipeline provides us with the ability to deliver against our previous guidance, we had expected to close more deals at this point in our fiscal year. As a result, we are adjusting our guidance down modestly. Mike will explain this when he reviews the financials, but first I'll discuss the results in each of our business segments. Our Application revenue this quarter was $115 million, up 17% from the same period last year. Most of the increase is attributable to the acquisitions of Adeptra and CR Software, but we continued to deliver very good results in fraud banking, which is up 14% year-over-year. As I said earlier, Applications is an area where we have seen delays in license sales. While we had a decent quarter, posting $13 million in license revenue, we had expected to close even more deals in Q3 but did not because of the lengthening sales cycle. Our Tools revenue was $22 million this quarter, up 7% from the same period last year. The increase was driven primarily by services revenue, as we work with our customers to implement and customize our Blaze and Xpress products. We are also seeing an increase in maintenance revenues as we reap the benefits of previous license sales and the high rate of maintenance contract renewals. Our final segment is Scores. We're very pleased with the results in this segment, and particularly with the momentum that we've seen in both the B2B and B2C portions of the business. As you know, this quarter we renewed our contract with Experian. While I won't go into details, I will say that I'm very happy that we extended our long-standing relationship serving U.S. financial services customers. I'm also thrilled that the new agreement allows us to offer U.S. consumers their FICO Scores based on Experian data. Our website, myFICO.com now offers consumer FICO Scores based on credit data from each of the 3 bureaus. Our B2C business was up 21% versus last year, including a modest benefit from the sale of Experian-based scores, which we began to offer in June. We will see a full quarter impact in the fourth quarter and expect to see continued momentum in our subscription business to consumers. On the B2B side, revenues increased 10% over the same period last year, due to increased volumes driven by stronger mortgage and auto lending. We've also seen modest improvements in the macro environment and are beginning to see other signs of growth in consumer lending, particularly as financial institutions seek to market their products and services to broader segments with consumers. Coming out of the recession, banks tended to offer credit primarily to consumers with high FICO Scores. Now as they begin to compete for the business with consumers with mid-range FICO Scores, we expect volumes to continue to improve. We've continued to move quickly to integrate the acquisitions we've made in the past year and expect them to make significant contributions to our revenue and margins in fiscal 2014, which we'll discuss next quarter. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for further financial details.
Michael J. Pung: Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll emphasize 3 points in my prepared comments. First, our revenue this quarter was $184 million, a 15% increase over the same period last year and a 2% increase over the prior quarter. The increase from last year was primarily driven by our acquisitions, with about 1% of the growth coming organically. Second, we delivered $20 million of GAAP net income and free cash flow of $27 million. We repurchased about $48 million of stock this quarter, made a $49 million scheduled debt repayment and ended the quarter with $93 million of cash. Finally, we are revising our guidance today, moving the revenue range down slightly and adjusting net income to reflect this revenue change, as well as the noncash tax charge we took this quarter. Now I'll break revenue down into our 3 reporting segments. Starting with Applications, revenue was $115 million, up 17% versus the same period last year but down 2% from last quarter. Much of the increase from the prior year was due to the acquisitions of Adeptra and CR Software, which accounted for about $20 million of revenue in this quarter. In the second segment, Tools, revenue was $22 million, up 7% versus the prior year and up 20% versus the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to growth in services and maintenance revenue. License sales were flat with the same period last year but up 80% over last quarter. And third, in our Scores segment, revenue was $47 million, up 12% from the same period last year and up 7% from the prior quarter. As Will noted, we delivered very solid results in both B2B and in B2C. B2B was up 10% compared to the same period last year and 8% compared to last quarter. On the B2C side, we're continuing to see good growth, up 21% versus the same period a year ago and 4% versus last quarter. This quarter, our consumer business benefited modestly from the Experian agreement. And next quarter, we will see the full benefit. As we said last quarter, we see macro trends continue to improve steadily, although not dramatically. Looking at our revenue by region. This quarter's 72% of total revenue was derived from our Americas region, our EMEA region generated 19% and the remaining 9% was from Asia Pacific. Recurring revenue, derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter, represented 70% of total revenues, consulting and implementation revenues were 18% of total and license revenues were 12% of total revenue. During the quarter, we recorded $22 million of license revenue versus $19 million in the prior quarter, with the increase driven by the Applications business. We are continuing to see delays in purchasing decisions by our customers, particularly among North American banks. We are still confident we will close these deals, but the delays may push some license revenue into our first quarter of 2014. Turning now to bookings. We generated $20 million of current period revenue on bookings of $70 million, a 28% yield, and the weighted average term for our bookings was 23 months this quarter. Of this $70 million in bookings, 22% relates to fraud solutions, 22% to decision management tools and 13% to collections and recovery solutions. We had 17 booking deals in excess of $1 million, 2 of which exceeded $3 million. Transactional and maintenance bookings were 28% of total this quarter; professional service bookings were 43% this quarter; and finally, license bookings were 29% this quarter. Turning to expenses. Operating expenses totaled $149 million this quarter compared to $146 million in the prior quarter or up $3 million. We expect the operating expenses to increase modestly next quarter with increased revenue. As you can see on our Reg G schedule, our non-GAAP operating margin was 25% for the third quarter versus 24% in the prior quarter. The initial margins associated with the acquired product lines are lower than historical FICO margins, and we expect operating leverage to improve as we fully realize expense synergies and grow these businesses. GAAP net income this quarter was $20 million versus $18 million in the prior quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $29 million versus $25 million in the prior quarter. The effective tax rate was about 31% this quarter, but includes a noncash tax valuation allowance charge of $2.5 million or $0.07 per share, associated with tax law changes in one of the larger states where we do business. We expect the effective tax rate to be about 31% for the full year. The free cash flow for the quarter was $27 million or 15% of revenue compared to $31 million or 18% of revenue in the prior quarter. Year-to-date, our free cash flow is $78 million. We have $93 million in cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet. This is down $38 million from last quarter, primarily due to our share repurchases and the debt retirement, offset by increases in cash generated from operations. Our total debt is $485 million with a weighted average interest rate of 5.7%. We made a $49 million principal payment in May on our notes and now have a $30 million balance on our $200 million revolving credit facility. The ratio of our total net debt to adjusted EBITDA is 2.1x, below the covenant level of 3x. And our total fixed charge coverage ratio is at 4.5x, well above the covenant level of 2.5x. During the quarter, we returned $48 million in excess cash to our investors through our stock repurchase plan. We repurchased approximately 1 million shares at an average price of $48.51. We still have $102 million remaining on the current board authorization and continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of excess cash. We also evaluate opportunities to acquire relevant technologies and products that advance our strategy or strengthen our portfolio and competitive position. Now on the guidance. When we've provided guidance at the beginning of the year, we anticipated revenue to grow from our acquisitions, from the recurring revenue associated with our installation base and from new license sales generated from our products. While we are performing at or above our expectations on the first 2 areas, we expected more growth in license revenue than we've seen so far this year. We continue to pursue many pipeline opportunities, some of which are substantial. But because we are seeing delays in purchasing decisions, we are revising our annual guidance down modestly to reflect this uncertainty around the timing of these deals. We now believe our total revenue for the fiscal year will fall between $755 million and $765 million compared to our previous guidance of $760 million to $770 million. And GAAP net income will be $94 million to $97 million versus the previous guidance of $100 million. This change includes the impacts of the $2.5 million tax charge. New GAAP EPS guidance is $2.61 to $2.70 versus our previous guidance of $2.80. This new guidance reflects an annual diluted share count of approximately 36 million shares. On a non-GAAP basis, we now expect to deliver $125 million to $128 million of non-GAAP net income compared to the previous guidance of $128 million, and non-GAAP EPS of $3.48 to $3.57 a share compared to the previous guidance of $3.60 a share. As always, we continue to manage our expenses wisely, while investing in our internal growth initiatives. I'll now turn the call back to Steve for question-and-answer. Steve?
Steven P. Weber: Thanks, Mike. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we're ready now to take your questions. Lita, please open the lines.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Manav Patnaik.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Gentlemen, the first -- just the details, in terms of the $20 million, I think you said contribution from acquisitions, how did that split between Adeptra and CR Software?
Michael J. Pung: Manav, Adeptra was roughly 70% of that $20 million. There was roughly another $5 million from CR and the rest from the other 2 small deals.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. All right. Fair enough. Now on the Scores side, you talked, obviously, this quarter you had some nice benefit from mortgage and auto. And I guess going forward, you're seeing some modest improvement in the consumer side. Now with the mortgage headwind for the second half of the year, is there -- like how should we read in terms of the -- either the sequential or year-over-year growth on the B2B side, at least? I understand B2C will see that benefit from the Experian deal.
Michael J. Pung: Yes. On the B2B side, we're continuing to see modest growth, and I would expect our fourth quarter on the B2B side to be somewhat flat or potentially down depending upon the timing of the slowdown in some of the mortgage refinancing. We're not seeing that rapidly in the near term, but there is a possibility we see some flat or downtick on the B2B side for that region.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, fair enough. And I guess, last question. Nice to see you guys back in the buyback market. Just curious on is that sort of an indication that the M&A activity will slow down or pause for now? Or is it just that there aren't that many deals in the horizon? Anything to read into that?
William J. Lansing: Manav, the answer to that is it's -- is the same as the answer we've had, which is we look at acquisitions on a somewhat opportunistic basis, and we can't completely control the timing of when the right deal comes along. And so where we have the cash available and we don't have the deal, we're in buyback mode. And now and then, the buybacks are going to be suspended when we need to use the cash for acquisition. So I would not read too much into the fact that we bought a bunch of stock this quarter. That could be different next quarter or we could buy a bunch more. I mean, I really can't say.
Operator: Your next question comes from Carter Malloy.
Lauren Slabaugh - Stephens Inc., Research Division: This is Lauren Slabaugh in for Carter. Quick question on what you mentioned about the lengthening of the license sale cycle. Could you just give a little more color on what's going on behind the scenes at some of the big banks to cause this?
William J. Lansing: I think that is a combination of 2 things. It's a combination of the environment that our customers are operating in, and we all know that environment. And so there's a little more complexity to their side of the equation. And I think the other part of it is the way we're going at our deals. We're looking at larger deals, and they naturally take longer to get done. And so it's a combination of both factors.
Lauren Slabaugh - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And then moving over to the Scores business. Could you just go a little bit about the health of the prescreen and marketing business there?
William J. Lansing: Yes. On the prescreen side, we've seen some modest growth over the last 3 quarters in a row on volumes that are being pulled for acquisition and marketing purposes. This quarter, we saw 8% growth over last year on volume acquisitions. And year-to-date, we're up modestly, about 4% on a year-to-date basis. We have seen more of the actual revenue growth, though, coming on the origination side, and that's been tied more to the mortgage and the autos. So I would say modest improvement, nothing eye-popping and off the charts, but several quarters in a row of continued growth is well accepted here.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.
William J. Lansing: Thank you.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Charlene, I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fair Isaac Corporation Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Steve Weber, you may begin your conference, sir.
Steven P. Weber: Thank you, Charlene. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining FICO's second quarter earnings call. And I'm Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike Pung. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. Today, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular, the risk factors and forward-looking statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and the Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through May 24, 2013. Now I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
William J. Lansing: Thanks, Steve. Today, we announced the results for our second quarter of fiscal 2013. I'll briefly discuss those results, update you on our progress with the acquisitions we've made in the last year and discuss some of the internal investments we've been making to generate greater value from our product portfolio. In our second quarter, we reported revenue of $179 million, an increase of 12% over the same period last year. We delivered $25 million of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS of $0.69 per share, an increase of 5% from the same period last year. On a GAAP basis, we delivered $18.5 million of net income and earnings of $0.51 per share for the quarter, down 8% and 7%, respectively, from the same period last year. The reduced margin is primarily due to soft license sales this quarter as well as implementation expenses as we ramp up applications to drive future recurring revenue. Mike will delve into the numbers in a few minutes and discuss how we expect to deliver the full year results we've guided. But first, let me tell you a bit about our acquisitions and internal investments we've undertaken that are advancing our growth strategy. This quarter, we announced the acquisition of Infoglide, a leading provider of entity resolution and social network analytics. This tuck-in acquisition brings critical link analysis functionality that we've been licensing from them for our fraud prediction products. The technology is state-of-the-art at finding suspicious information in an insurance claim or financial transaction and then making links with other transactions to expose otherwise invisible patterns. And in this era of Big Data analytics, it has applications to other areas that interest our clients, social networks, for example, that extend well beyond fraud management. Watch the space for some exciting developments in the months ahead. This is the first full quarter of results from our acquisition of CR Software. The added functionality from CR makes our debt collection and recovery solutions best-in-class and greatly expands our addressable market. Initial response from customers has been very encouraging. We have developed a significant pipeline and we're working hard to convert it into revenue in the coming quarters. With Entiera, we continue to migrate current clients onto that platform as they renew their contracts. The customer dialogue technology we obtained from this acquisition has quickly become a cornerstone of our marketing solutions. I'm very pleased with the progress we're making with the Adeptra product that we acquired last year. We signed more than 10 deals this quarter, including 2 large deals in Asia, which will deliver significant recurring subscription revenue as they go live over the next few quarters. We are convinced that this customer engagement technology will increasingly become mission-critical infrastructure as companies strive to improve their customers' experience. We've had discussions with several large companies that are interested in partnering with us, to use FICO Adeptra customer engagement technology in their applications outside of the markets we currently serve. This product has excellent growth potential and it validates our strategy to invest in robust products with revenue opportunities beyond the financial services sector. Finally, I'd like to talk about innovation. We've stepped up our development efforts in the area of enterprise fraud prevention, which is proving to be a significant growth driver for the business. We focused significant resources on the specific areas of application fraud, online fraud and merchant monitoring. This quarter, we introduced FICO application Fraud Manager, the first solution combining advanced decision management and investigated workflow capabilities with analytics for both first-party and third-party application fraud. The solution helps private companies and public agencies across multiple markets and sectors reduce losses while improving customer service. And this solution is addressing a significant problem, application fraud is estimated to cause credit grantors more than $6.7 billion a year in the U.S. alone and polished figures may not account for the full scope of the problem. That's because most reported application fraud is third-party fraud, which involves identity theft. Yet many industry experts believe the bigger problem is first-party fraud, in which the criminal is the customer, who obtains credit often by falsifying information without intending to pay it back. Historically, this kind of fraud has been difficult to detect and often the losses are characterized as bad debt rather than fraud. One industry analyst group estimates that first-party fraud in credit cards costs $18.5 billion worldwide in 2012 and will rise to $28.6 billion by 2016. It's this much larger problem that FICO is tackling and we think the potential for widespread adoption of our product is significant. The strong response we've had to the FICO Adeptra product has led us to dedicate more resources to developing the next-generation of customer engagement capabilities and embedding them in multiple FICO applications that span our clients customer life cycles. We remain convinced that this customer engagement solution is solving a critical need for our customers and will remain a solid growth area for us for many years to come. Lastly, we've been working on some exciting cloud-based technology initiatives that we believe will dramatically change the way businesses, large and small, develop and deploy analytics. We believe this innovation will be a game changer, allowing rapid development of solutions to problems that were previously thought to be unsolvable. We'll be announcing this innovation live to more than 600 of our customers at our FICO World Conference in Miami next week. FICO World is always among the high points of the year for us and for our clients. This year, we'll explore how banks, retailers and other businesses worldwide are using the latest Big Data analytics to better understand customer needs, pinpoint risk and improve the customer experience. The customer revolution continues to gain momentum with consumers demanding more from companies and raising the stakes of competition. This is FICO's home turf, helping businesses cut through the volume, velocity and variety of Big Data to un-lock its value and making smarter decisions. We will continue to focus our resources on using analytic technology to extract value from the explosion of data that's becoming available. This is where we believe the real growth potential lies and the greatest opportunity for meaningful financial returns. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for further financial details.
Michael J. Pung: Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll emphasize 3 points in my prepared comments. First, our revenue this quarter was $179 million, a 12% increase over the same period last year and a 6% increase -- 6% decrease over the prior quarter. Our recurring revenue remained strong, representing 71% of total revenue while license revenue this quarter disappointed. Second, we delivered $18.5 million of GAAP net income and $0.51 of GAAP earnings per share, decreases over the same period last year. On a non-GAAP basis, both net income and EPS increased from the same period last year. Finally, we delevered our balance sheet over the past 2 quarters. Free cash flow was $31 million this quarter and our cash balance now stands at $131 million. Turning to revenue. Revenue for the quarter of $179 million or a 12% increase over the prior year. Approximately 10% of the growth related to the Adeptra and CR Software acquisitions. I'll breakdown the revenue into our 3 reporting segments. The first segment is applications. Revenue from applications was $117 million, up $21 million or 22% versus the same period last year but down $7 million or 6% from last quarter when we had several large license deals. Much of the increase is due to the acquisition of Adeptra and CR Software, which accounted for about $17 million of revenue this quarter. The rest of the portfolio performed well, growing about 4% over the same period last year. The second segment is Scores. Overall Scores revenue was $44 million, essentially flat with the same quarter last year and up 1% from the prior quarter. The B2B revenue was flat with last year which has, a reminder, included a one-time Scores project. On the B2C side, the renewed focus we're putting into the business is beginning to pay off with growth this quarter at 13% versus the same period 1 year ago. We've continued to see strength in both areas of our Scores business and are encouraged by macro trends as well as steadily improving internal execution. The third segment is Tools. Revenue in this segment was $18 million, down 5% versus the prior year and 17% versus the prior quarter. While our second fiscal quarter is typically a weak period for Tools license sales, this quarter was even lighter than expected as we saw customer delays in purchasing. After several consecutive strong quarters in our Tools business, this was an area of disappointment for the quarter. Our pipeline for the business, however, remained strong and we are redoubling our focus on sales execution in the back half of the year to meet our plan. Looking at our revenue by region. This quarter, 72% of total revenue was derived from our Americas region, our EMEA region generated 20%, and the remaining 8% was from Asia Pacific. By type of revenue, recurring revenue, which is derived from transactional and maintenance sources, for the quarter represented 71% of total revenues versus 68% in the prior quarter; consulting and implementation revenues were 19% of total versus 17% in the prior quarter; and license revenues were 10% of total revenue versus 15% in the prior quarter. During the quarter, we recorded $19 million of license revenue versus $28 million in quarter 1 with declines in both our Applications and Tools businesses. We had several large deals that pushed which we will continue to pursue. This mix shift had an impact on our margins which I'll detail shortly. Turning now into bookings. We generated $16 million of current period revenue on bookings of $85 million or a 19% yield. This compares with $27 million of revenue on bookings of $82 million, which was a 33% yield in the prior quarter, meaning a greater percentage of our bookings will convert to revenue in future quarters. The weighted average term of our bookings was 28 months this quarter compared to 24 months in the prior quarter. Of the $85 million in bookings, 26% relates to fraud solutions, 15% to our Adeptra mobility product line, 14% to customer management solutions, 11% to decision management Tools and 10% to collections and recovery solutions. We had 16 booking deals in excess of $1 million, 4 of which exceeded $3 million. Transactional and maintenance bookings were 46% of total this quarter versus 33% in the prior quarter. Professional services bookings were 44% this quarter versus 34% in the prior quarter. Finally, license bookings were 10% in this quarter versus 33% in the prior quarter. As Will mentioned, we signed more than 10 Adeptra deals. We include the estimated future revenue from an Adeptra contract in our reported bookings when either the proof of concept is complete or there are minimum contractual commitments. Some of the deals signed this quarter have not completed the proof of concept and, therefore, are not reflected in the reported bookings number. These bookings backlog of signed deals will be reflected in a future booking. Turning to expenses. Operating expenses totaled $146 million this quarter compared to $147 million in the prior quarter or down $1 million. The decrease was primarily due to nonrecurring restructuring charges we took last quarter. We expect operating expenses to increase modestly in the last 2 quarters of the year. As you can see on our Reg G schedule, non-GAAP operating margin was 24% for the second quarter versus 29% in the prior quarter. The decline in this quarter was due to the decrease in higher margin license sales and the resulting product mix shift. While margins associated with the acquired product lines are initially lower than historical FICO margins, we expect operating leverage to improve as we fully realize expense synergies and grow these businesses. GAAP net income this quarter was $18.5 million versus $23 million in the prior quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $25 million versus $32 million in the prior quarter. The effective tax rate was about 27% this quarter and reflects the expected benefit from the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. We expect the effective rate to be about 31% to 32% for the full year fiscal '13. In terms of free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and dividends paid, was $31 million for the quarter or 18% of revenue compared to $19 million or 10% of revenue in the prior quarter. Moving on to the balance sheet. We have $131 million in cash and marketable securities. This is up $40 million from last quarter, primarily due to increases from operations. Our total debt is $504 million with a weighted average interest rate of 6.1%. We have a $49 million principal payment that's due in May. The ratio of our total net debt to adjusted EBITDA is 2x, below the covenant level of 3x. And our total fixed charge coverage ratio is at 4.4x, well above the covenant level of 2.5x. We had no borrowings under our line of credit facility. We did not repurchase any shares during our second quarter as we delevered our balance sheet after the current and recent acquisitions. We still have $150 million remaining on the current Board authorization and continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of excess cash. On the guidance. Finally, while we are running behind our plan due to this quarter's revenue shortfall, we have visibility into a significant pipeline of opportunities over the balance of the year. In particular, we expect accelerated growth from our Adeptra and CR Software acquisitions, from license opportunities within our Tools business and further growth associated with our core transactional revenue. We will continue to manage our expenses wisely while investing in our internal growth initiatives. Accordingly, we are reiterating our annual guidance today and, in addition, adding non-GAAP metrics to our guidance. As a reminder, our guidance for revenue is $760 million to $770 million and GAAP net income of $100 million or earnings per share of $2.80. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect to deliver $128 million of non-GAAP net income and $3.60 of non-GAAP EPS. This assumes amortization of approximately $13 million, restructuring- and acquisition-related expense of approximately $3 million and stock-based comp of approximately $25 million. With that, I'll turn the call back to Steve for question-and-answer.
Steven P. Weber: Thanks, Mike. This concludes our prepared remarks. And we're ready now to take your questions. Operator, please open the line.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Carter Malloy from Stephens.
Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division: So can you give us a little more around the license revenues' softness this quarter and really just more around your confidence going forward? Because looking at tax rate up and OpEx up, we're going to be leaning pretty heavily on that on the revenue growth to come through for the back half.
Michael J. Pung: Yes, absolutely, Carter. So at the beginning of the year, we had an annual guidance that had very aggressive license revenue. We saw a very good pipeline coming into the year across the existing businesses we have and since then, we had bought CR Software. And the pipeline of CR Software's -- came very large and is growing even more significantly now that we have a system of record embedded within our collections and recovery business. Coming into the end of this quarter, quarter #2, we had a handful of large transactions that we had line of sight on, that we didn't get the deals done on and didn't get them closed for a variety of reasons, purchasing decisions were delayed and some of the deals slipped forward. We've signed 1 or 2 small ones but we're still pursuing much of the large transactions. With that, we also believe that with the CR Software business and the ramp-up of the Adeptra business, we do have line of sight certainly to the bottom end of our guidance and enough pipeline to safely get us well within the guided range we have on revenue. As it related to OpEx, while we see some modest increases in OpEx over the balance of the year, we pretty much absorbed all the cost associated with the acquisitions. And now it's a matter of simply just running the business as efficiently as we believe we have in the past and we can. And so while we see some modest growth on the OpEx side, it isn't going to be very significant with respect to, certainly, what's been seen with the on-boarding of some of these transactions. As it relates to the tax rate, we've been guiding the full year all along at around 31% to 32%. So really, nothing's changed there but for the reinstatement of the R&D credit, which we assumed would happen within the numbers we provided at the beginning of the year.
Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division: So that helps. And on -- so on the R&D expense line, do you expect it to stay down here as percent of revenue and not -- at last couple of calls or 2, 3 or 4 calls back, that was expected to go up. But since, it seems you guys have maybe capped that back off down here in the high single-digits.
Michael J. Pung: Yes. I mean we were expecting it to be around the 9% range. Actually the absolute dollar amount has gone up and part of that is just a redeployment of functions from other areas into R&D, so taking administrative cost out of our R&D team or our IT team and reinvesting it on the R&D line item. But the rate we're running at right now is probably the right absolute dollar amount.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Well, just firstly, you talked a lot about the -- on -- in the innovation section, you ran through a bunch of different things which you sounded excited about. Could you just again just -- I sort of missed the last one you talked about, the one you're releasing in Miami, if you could just repeat that. And then just when should we start -- like what's sort of time frame should we expect seeing some sort of a benefit or meaningful contribution through revenue from these products that you talked about?
William J. Lansing: Sure. So if it sounded like we didn't give you a lot of detail around that last item, it was by design. It was because we're announcing it formally at FICO World in 1 week. But I'm happy to give you a little bit more, I don't think it will spoil the party. It -- we call it decision management platform and it's basically our analytics in the cloud, made available on the cloud, that it's very easy for customers to pull down our analytic tools and apply them to whatever it is they like and make better decisions with it. So that's -- we think that's going to have a lot of uptake. We think that's going to be a pretty good product offering, I should say, it's really a service. And so that's one. I'd say one that has more short-term impact is our Infoglide acquisition and how that ties to some of the internal fraud products that we've developed, particularly around application fraud. That is -- as I said earlier, it's a really big problem for the industry and we're now increasingly able to focus on it and help them with it. The -- in terms of time frame, we love all our children equally. We invest in all of our important franchises and we continue to make good progress with Falcon and good progress with our other major franchises. The collection recovery franchise has been challenging, I guess, is a way to put it, because we've been accelerating the migration from our legacy products over to our newly acquired Debt Manager 9 product and that resulted in some incremental expense this quarter, not that it wasn't anticipated but it's expense we don't anticipate recurring. And so I think that we're going to start to see a lot of benefit out of that transition. And particularly, when you look at our collections recovery franchise, not just from the standpoint of a core product in Titanium/DM9 but also the way it works with Adeptra and how those products tie together, I think we're going to see some really meaningful revenue and profit coming out of it. And that could -- that's just going to accelerate in the back half of the year and into next year.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. Fair enough. And Mike, you talked about, in your commentary, that you were encouraged by the macro trends. Could you maybe expand a little more with some specifics on what you guys are seeing and what those data points for that were encouraging?
Michael J. Pung: Yes. In particular, Manav, we've been experiencing a long period of time, as you know, where our Scores business and the volumes underneath our Scores business on the Originations side have been going sideways. And we're starting to see some improvement on that end. It just so happens we had a tough comparable period for our B2B Scores business and that last year we had a large transaction that hit our revenue line item. But except for that line item, we're starting to see some nice growth on the B2B side. I wouldn't say we're off to the races and I am not trying to imply that. But certainly compared to what we've seen in the past, we're starting to see further progress on the macro side on the Scores business.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And I guess, in the balance sheet, you talked about the mix of your business here between credit card, mortgage and the rest. Can you provide any more color between those like anyone doing better than the other that's taking, I guess, the modest growth that you're referring to?
Michael J. Pung: Yes, I know. We're -- things haven't changed materially on any of the individual particular line items. We're seeing a little bit more out of credit cards but fundamentally, things haven't materially changed.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Galinko from Sidoti.
Matthew Galinko - Sidoti & Company, LLC: I saw CapEx seems to be trending a little bit higher through the first couple of quarters for the year. Just curious what's driving that and how do you expect it to close out back half of the year?
Michael J. Pung: Yes, that's a great question. CapEx, year-to-date, is probably twice what it was last year at this same time, Matt. And a big part of what is driving the growth was the opening up of 2 office facilities, one in Roseville, Minnesota and one here in expansion in San Jose where we've, in Minnesota, consolidated from 2 facilities to 1. And that included some build-out along with just equipping the facility, much of that hit in the first quarter. In the second quarter here, much of the driver behind the CapEx number was investment that we have made in -- on the Adeptra side to set up distribution opportunities outside the U.S. and Asia, in particular, where we signed a couple of very large deals along with simply the equipment in PCs and things of that nature that we have upgraded and put into the hands of the people in the companies that we bought. We'll probably end the year up with, in total, $25 million to $28 million of CapEx, which is quite a bit larger than we'd historically run. But we're investing in parts of the company that -- especially on the Adeptra side that does have revenue payback, it's just not overhead.
Matthew Galinko - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Got you. And I mean, how substantial are the investments in billing some hosted infrastructure as I think you talked about in some of the new products?
Michael J. Pung: Overall, they're not material in that an Adeptra data center, as an example, is not a significant full service data center, it's more of a telecom data center. And so the investments aren't that large individually. And in the aggregate, we're putting them in place in countries where we see the largest of opportunities. So in the grand scale, they're not really significant. For the rest of the business, we generally made our data center investments about 1.5 year ago and we still have enough capacity in the U.S. for, I'll call them, legacy FICO ramp-up.
Matthew Galinko - Sidoti & Company, LLC: And then can you just repeat what you saw on the B2C side of the Scores business?
Michael J. Pung: Yes. Our B2C side grew 13% on a year-over-year basis. We were very close to $11 million of revenue on the B2C side, something we haven't seen in several years. Much of it is driven from an increase, conscious increase, to grow our subscription side of that business as opposed to onetime Score polls. And as you compound enough of that backlog of subscription revenue, you begin to see some lift and, in fact, we're starting to see that along with the benefits of some of the infrastructure changes that we made 1 quarter ago.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tom Ernst from Deutsche Bank.
Nandan Amladi - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Nandan Amladi on behalf of Tom. Going back -- I have a 2-part question. On some of these new products, I know you sell subscriptions. Has the nature of the sales process changed at all as a result? And second part of the question is do you have enough sales capacity to address the stronger second half?
William J. Lansing: So the answer to the first question, yes, absolutely. There's a difference in the way you incent salespeople for SaaS business. And when we acquired Adeptra and Entiera both, I mean, there was -- we incorporated into our sales plans some of the sales incentive methodology that was in place there. As more and more of our business becomes available on a SaaS basis, we will be working through the implications of that for how we drive incentives through our sales force. To the second part of your question, the capacity -- we actually feel like our capacity is adequate. We feel pretty good about it. And we are always adding and subtracting salespeople on the margin. But we're -- I -- we feel comfortable about where we are.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions in queue at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters.
Steven P. Weber: Thank you. This concludes our call today. Thank you all for joining.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2013 Q1  (2013-01-30 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Steven P. Weber - Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer William J. Lansing - Chief Executive Officer, President and Director Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Chief Investor Relations and Executive Vice President
Analysts: Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division Ben Hearnsberger - Stephens Inc., Research Division
Operator: Good afternoon, and good evening. My name is Sheryl Lee, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fair Isaac Corporation First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Steve Weber, you may begin your conference, sir.
Steven P. Weber: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining FICO's first quarter earnings call. I'm Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike Pung. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. Today, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular, in the Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at www.fico.com, and on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through March 1, 2013. Now, I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
William J. Lansing: Thanks, Steve. Today, we announced the results of our first quarter of fiscal 2013. I'll briefly discuss those results and then discuss the progress we're making with the acquisitions we made in 2012 and how those acquisitions are helping us reach our strategic goals. First, I'm happy to report that we had another good quarter. Our revenue of $190 million was an increase of 12% over the same period last year and 2% over the previous quarter. We delivered $23 million of net income and earnings of $0.65 for the quarter, which includes $0.06 per share of onetime charges taken in the quarter. As we did last quarter, our revenues grew across our entire portfolio. Our Applications business was up 13% versus the same quarter last year. Scores was up 2% versus the same quarter last year, and Tools was up 24% versus the previous year. These results included about 1 month of contributions from our acquisition of CR Software at the end of November. Mike will provide more detail, but first I'd like to talk about what CR Software brings us and how, along with Entiera and Adeptra, it is helping us realize our strategic vision and accelerate our growth. When I moved from the board to the CEO position 1 year ago, I said this was a highly attractive business with bright prospects. We have a strong brand and are viewed broadly as a pioneer and leader in using analytics to help businesses make better decisions. We also have a terrific set of products that are highly valued by our customers and deeply embedded into their business processes. However, the maturity of our products and the deep market penetration has also met with modest organic growth. So I also said that we'd be looking at complementing our organic growth with some carefully considered M&A activity. And we have a talented team of people who are attuned to the opportunities presented by the rise of Big Data and are excited about helping our customers understand and leverage its potential. So over the past year, we've made internal investments and acquisitions to expand our addressable market. Specifically, we're pursuing 3 strategic initiatives: first, we are diversifying into industries where we can bring our core analytic competencies to bear in the same ways we've done for decades in financial services. We're paying particular attention to industries that are in the early stages of using analytics to generate value. And our extensive IP portfolio puts us several steps ahead of our competitors. Our acquisitions of Entiera, Adeptra and CR Software have helped us with this diversification strategy. They bring customer bases in retail, telecom, government, health care and other industries, while at the same time providing product extension cross-sell opportunities for our current customer base. Our second area of focus is to provide innovative software-as-a-service offerings of our solution. Getting this right will provide us with a significant growth opportunity, again, by expanding our addressable market. Many of our current solutions appeal to large institutions with the infrastructure and resources to implement them. By offering SaaS-based products, we will be able to efficiently serve smaller organizations and those in emerging markets with lower cost, less complex implementations. Both Adeptra and Entiera have boosted our SaaS capabilities, and CR Software features a technology platform that offers many of these benefits as well. Our final area of focus is Big Data. As I've said, I'm convinced we are in a great position to capitalize on the opportunities inherent in Big Data, in particular because our unparalleled analytics expertise makes us uniquely qualified to extract value from the explosion of data that's becoming available. In many ways, this focus goes hand-in-hand with the first 2, as it's critical that we view this play across verticals and provide SaaS-based solutions to give customers agile and efficient delivery of analytics. As an example of the results we're seeing from this strategic approach, I'd like to talk for a moment about our latest acquisition, CR Software. This company provides a natural complement to our existing collections in recovery product line. CR's flagship product, Titanium, gives us the ability to offer analytics-based, C&R solutions FICO's known for to industries beyond banking, as well as to smaller businesses and institutions that couldn't otherwise afford the benefits of our Debt Manager product. Titanium also accelerates the delivery of robust, differentiated capabilities that are increasingly important and valuable to our customers. For example, the system of record capability is a true extension of the user's host system, simplifying, automating and coordinating collections and recovery operations across the enterprise, leading to higher returns. Integration, while only 1 month in, is going extremely well and meeting expectations, and we're happy with the enthusiastic feedback we're getting from our customers and prospects. I'm also pleased to report that Adeptra continues to exceed expectations. We had a great quarter with the product line, with $4.3 million of bookings, a nice pipeline of recurring, ratable revenue that will come online as implementations are completed over the next several months. Finally, we had another good quarter with Entiera, with more than $3 million of bookings this quarter, which further demonstrates marketplace acceptance of the benefits this SaaS-based solution can provide. Before I turn the call over to Mike to provide more detail on the numbers, I'd like to take a few moments to discuss our headquarter's move to San Jose. With worldwide demand for analytic solutions surging, it's critical that we expand our presence and visibility in Silicon Valley, the epicenter of software innovation and home to the vast technology ecosystem that we will leverage to accelerate our growth. By establishing our headquarters in San Jose, we'll be in close proximity to many potential partners, industry leaders, as well as fast-rising start-ups in Big Data, cloud computing, mobility and social networking. And we'll have ready access to the world's deepest pool of analytic, engineering and software development talent. Our headquarter's move to Silicon Valley is also a homecoming. FICO was founded by Bill Fair and Earl Isaac in 1956 after they met and collaborated at the renowned Stanford Research Institute. The innovative spirit of value has always been in our DNA, and we're just beginning to see the full expression of it. So with that, I'll now pass the call to Mike for further financial details.
Michael J. Pung: Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will emphasize 3 points in my comments: first, we had a solid first quarter, delivering $190 million of revenue, a 12% increase over the same period last year and 2% over the prior quarter; second, for the first quarter, we delivered $23 million in net income and $0.65 of EPS, increases over the prior quarter of 10% and 8%, respectively; finally, beginning this quarter, we will begin discussing additional non-GAAP metrics, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share, in addition to the non-GAAP operating margin and free cash flow, which we've talked about in the past. Non-GAAP net income, EPS and operating margins all exclude the impact of amortization expense, share-based comp and restructuring and acquisition-related items. These non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding significant non-cash expenses and other items that may not be indicative of recurring business results. And they are used by management in operational decision-making. While our current guidance is on a GAAP basis, we expect to add non-GAAP guidance in a future quarter. With that, let's talk about revenue. Revenue for the quarter was $190 million or 12% over the prior year. Approximately 9% of the growth is related to our M&A activity, with the remaining 3% organic. I'll break down the revenue into our 3 reporting segments. First, in Applications. Revenue from Applications was $125 million, up 13% versus the same period last year and up 4% from last quarter. Much of the increase is due to the acquisition of Adeptra, which accounted for about $13 million of revenue this quarter. The rest of the portfolio performed well and compares favorably to the same period last year, when we had an unusually high amount of license revenue. The second segment, Scoring. Overall Scores revenue was $43 million, an increase of 2% from the same quarter last year and down 7% from the prior quarter. This growth is driven by the B2B scores sold to financial institutions. We continue to see strength on the Originations side, particularly driven from mortgage and auto financing. The third segment is Tools. Revenue in this segment was $22 million, up 24% versus the prior year and up 13% versus the prior quarter. The increase was driven primarily from several large sales of FICO Blaze Advisor and the resale of some third-party products. Looking at our revenue by region, this quarter, 76% of total revenue was derived from the Americas region; our EMEA region generated 17%; and the remaining 7% was from Asia Pacific. Recurring revenue derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter represented 68% of total revenues versus 66% in the prior quarter. Consulting and implementation revenues were 17% of total revenues versus 18% in the prior quarter. And license revenues were 15% of total revenue, the same as last quarter. During the quarter, we recorded $28 million of license revenue, about the same as the prior quarter. Now turning to bookings. We generated $27 million of current period revenue on bookings of $82 million, a 33% yield. This compares with $31 million of revenue on bookings of $99 million, a 32% yield in the prior quarter. The weighted average term for our bookings was 28 months compared to 29 months in the prior quarter. Of the $82 million in bookings, 23% relates to Customer Management, 20% to Decision Management Tools and 11% to Fraud. Bookings related to our Adeptra mobility product line totaled just over $4 million or 5% of total bookings. We had 10 booking deals in excess of $1 million, 5 of which exceeded $3 million. Transactional and maintenance bookings were 33% of total bookings this quarter versus 40% in the prior quarter. Professional service bookings were 34% this quarter, the same as the prior quarter. And finally, license bookings were 33% in this quarter versus 26% in the prior quarter. Turning to expenses. Total operating expenses were $147 million this quarter compared to $145 million in the prior quarter, or up $2 million. The increase is primarily due to increased amortization and operating expenses related to our acquisitions. We expect operating expenses to increase next quarter as we absorb a full quarter of expense from CR Software. As you can see on our Reg G schedule, non-GAAP operating margin was 29% for the first quarter, the same as in the prior quarter. While margins associated with the acquired product lines are initially lower than historical FICO margins, we expect operating leverage to improve as we fully realize expense synergies and grow these businesses. GAAP net income this quarter was $23 million versus $21 million in the prior quarter, and non-GAAP net income was $32 million versus $30 million in the prior quarter. Our effective tax rate was about 33.2% this quarter and we expect the effective rate to be about 31% to 32% in fiscal year '13, a reduction due to the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. We define free cash flow as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and dividends paid. The free cash flow for the quarter was $19 million or 10% of revenue compared to $17 million or 9% of revenue in the prior quarter. Free cash flow this quarter was impacted by the payout of our annual incentive awards and year-end commissions. Moving to the balance sheet. We have $91 million in cash and marketable securities. This is down $3 million from last quarter, mainly due to the acquisition of CR Software, which was partially offset by increases from operations. Our total debt is $504 million with a weighted average interest rate of 6%, and the cost of our debt is fairly fixed at about $8 million per quarter. The ratio of our total net debt to adjusted EBITDA is 2.2x, below the covenant level of 3x and our total fixed charge coverage ratio is at 4.4x, well above the covenant level of 2.5x. We have no borrowings under our credit facility. We did not repurchase any shares during the first quarter, as we delevered our balance sheet after recent acquisitions. We still have $150 million remaining on the current board authorization and evaluate both share repurchases and opportunities to acquire relevant technologies and products that advance our strategy or strengthen our portfolio and competitive position. Moving to guidance. We are updating our annual guidance today to reflect our acquisition of CR Software. Our previous guidance was for $740 million to $750 million of revenue, $100 million of GAAP net income and GAAP EPS of $2.80. Our new guidance is for revenue of $760 million to $770 million. Even though we have -- we will have a full quarter of CR Software in quarter 2, we expect the total quarter 2 revenue to be lower than quarter 1 due to seasonality in other parts of the business. While we expect CR Software to contribute $2 million of EBITDA this year, we are projecting it to be GAAP breakeven. Therefore, we are continuing to guide GAAP net income of $100 million and GAAP EPS of $2.80. In addition, this guidance assumes full year amortization expense of $13.5 million. I'll now turn the call back to Steve for question-and-answer.
Steven P. Weber: Thanks, Mike. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we're ready now to take any questions. Operator, please open the lines.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I guess, the first question -- maybe, it's housekeeping, but, I guess, you said $13 million was the contribution from Adeptra. What was the contribution from the other 2 acquisitions?
Michael J. Pung: The other 2 acquisitions, Manav, contributed just about $2.5 million worth of revenue.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And would that be all in the Applications segment?
Michael J. Pung: Yes, all of the M&A work we've done so far is rolling up in the Applications line.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: All right, fine. And then, just in terms of the big picture strategy that, Will, you've laid out -- and, obviously, you said these 3 acquisitions, obviously, help you build in that. I was wondering, looking over the next 12 to 24 months, how would you break out the opportunity between making more such acquisitions versus organically investing internally and trying to get to some of those targets?
William J. Lansing: Well, we have a plan with a substantial amount of internal organic investment, and that happens with or without additional M&A activity. We're committed to leveraging our resources internally to advance our strategy. The M&A piece, I would say, is a little bit more opportunistic. We try to be systematic about evaluating things out there, but, as you know, it has everything to do with the prices at which these things are available and whether a deal can be had. And so I would say that the part that's certain in working against our strategy is the organic part and the part that's opportunistic is the M&A part.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And Mike, I guess, could you just repeat -- I think you had given guidance on the tax rate. I missed that. What was the range?
William J. Lansing: 31% to 32%.
Michael J. Pung: Yes, 31% to 32%, based upon the reinstatement of the R&D credit, which we will be able to claim here in quarter 2.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carter Malloy.
Ben Hearnsberger - Stephens Inc., Research Division: This is actually Ben on for Carter. First, in looking at Adeptra, we expected it to be accretive this quarter. Was it accretive as expected? And can you kind of break out how much you have in guidance from Adeptra this year?
Michael J. Pung: Yes, when we guide -- let's start with your first question. It was accretive this quarter, both on a GAAP and on a non-GAAP basis. The EBITDA margin was roughly in the low teens, and it was roughly breakeven, slightly positive on a GAAP basis. As a reminder, this was the first full quarter that we have had Adeptra rolling into our numbers. For the year, we gave guidance of roughly around $55 million for the Adeptra business. And we're tracking to either meet or beat that.
Ben Hearnsberger - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay. And can you help us kind of understand how much of overall guidance is from acquisitions? Outside of Adeptra, obviously. And how much of that is coming from organic growth?
Michael J. Pung: Yes, we guided about 2% to 3% of organic growth embedded in our numbers, with the remainder coming from M&A. We basically guided an assumption that assumed that our Scoring business would continue to run flat with a little bit greater in the software side, similar to last year.
Ben Hearnsberger - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then lastly, on the Blaze product, how much of that upside came from onetime license sales?
Michael J. Pung: A lot of the Blaze deals are either perpetual or term license. And so most of the deals, the bigger deals this quarter, were perpetual licenses. And the whip [ph], therefore, would be a result of the 2 big transactions that we did this quarter, in addition to kind of the standard book of business we do.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And there are currently no questions in queue. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters.
Steven P. Weber: Thank you very much. This concludes our call. Thank you all for joining.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good evening. My name is Leticia, and I would like to welcome everyone to the Fair Isaac Corp. Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to today's host, Mr. Steve Webber. Mr. Weber, you may begin your conference.
Steven P. Weber: Thank you, Leticia. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining FICO's fourth quarter earnings call. I'm Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike Pung. Before we begin today, we'd like to offer our best wishes to those impacted by the recent hurricane. We know many of our employees, customers and partners have been directly impacted, and our thoughts are with you. Today, we posted on the Investor Relations portion of the FICO website a copy of our news release, our Regulation G disclosure schedule and our financial highlights. While our press release describes financial results compared to the prior year, today, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular, in the Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. In order to provide additional information to investors, we will use certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. A reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, entitled Regulation G Disclosure, is available on the Investor page of our website under the Presentations tab. A replay of this webcast will be available through December 1, 2012. Now I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
William J. Lansing: Thanks, Steve. Today, we announced the results for our fourth quarter fiscal 2012. I'll briefly summarize those results, and then discuss some of the exciting things we've been working on and what they mean for the growth of the business. I'm pleased to report we had a very strong finish to our fiscal year. Our revenue of $186 million was an increase of 16% over both the same period last year and the previous quarter. For the full fiscal year, revenues were $676 million, up 9% from the previous year. We delivered $21 million of net income and earnings of $0.60 for the quarter, which include $0.09 per share of one-time charges taken in the quarter and $92 million of net income and $2.55 EPS for the year. We saw revenue growth throughout our portfolio and across all regions, both in the fourth quarter and for the fiscal year in total. Our Applications business was up 23% versus the same quarter last year, and full year revenue was up 11% over the previous year. Tools were up 9% versus the same quarter last year, and full revenue was up 12% over the previous year. Scores also had a good year, with both the quarter and full year up 4% versus the previous year. Geographically, our Americas region was up 13% this quarter versus prior year quarter and 8% for the full year. APAC was up 12% this quarter versus the prior year and 9% for the full year. And we're very pleased with our EMEA region, where this quarter's 2011 were 33% higher than the same quarter last year, and the full year revenues were 13% higher this year than last. These numbers are a testament not only to our strong execution, but also the resilience of our products, even in unsure economic times. I would add these results included about one month of contributions from our acquisition of Adeptra during the quarter. Mike will provide more details as he looks at the numbers. But I'd like to first talk about how well that integration is going, and how we are building a strong growth engine at FICO. I'm delighted with the progress that's already been made in bringing Adeptra and FICO together. This has been an easy integration, as both cultures and technologies have come together well. We are putting several members of our Adeptra senior management team into key roles at FICO, with their helping not only with the integration, but adding valuable leadership. And I'm hearing great things from the field that reinforced the beliefs we've had when we were evaluating the transaction. At the recent annual sales meeting, there's a genuine buzz about the pipeline of opportunities for Adeptra. I heard again and again how customers are excited with what many view as a natural extension to our existing product set and how our salespeople have another best-in-class product available to sell immediately. Both the Adeptra and Entiera acquisitions helped us in 2 strategically important areas. First, we believe Adeptra gives us valuable opportunities to diversify from our base and financial services by taking our core competencies to other vertical industries. Entiera strengthens our position in the retail space and Adeptra, in addition to its application and financial services, helps us in telecom, retail and other industries looking to improve customer engagement. These are industries where analytics-based products can generate great value, and we aim to build our business in them as a compliment to our strong financial services foundation. Second, these 2 acquisitions both provide extensions to our line of SaaS-enabled offerings. As we've said, we're committed to providing innovative software as a service solutions to our customers, and both Entiera and Adeptra are helping us immediately to expand those offerings. Before I turn things over to Mike, I'd like to highlight a deal we signed this quarter with People's Bank of China, the central bank of the People's Republic of China, which controls monetary policy and regulates financial institutions in Mainland China. Our Scores division is working with PBOC to help it develop an industry standard score, and we'll participate in the validations of the score across major banks in China going forward. This project is a start of new initiatives in China for using analytics to manage consumer credit risk on a broader and more standardized basis. The relationship will allow PBOC to lever FICO's industry-leading analytics capabilities for credit risk management, understand and incorporate the national regulatory standards associated with credit risk into a standardized score and scale the score in to China's banks as a common credit risk scoring standard. China Score division is also helping PBOC to understand and manage the privacy implications associated with consumer information, as well as helping to broaden the foundational structures of consumer and credit education across the China financial services marketplace. FICO is the only foreign company working with PBOC on these strategic initiatives. These are exciting times at FICO. As I've said before, we are in a unique position to extract value from data and ultimately help our customers make smarter business decisions. As we look ahead, we're excited about the future. With the new growth opportunities we're pursuing both through internal investments and through the complementary acquisitions we've made, we're building our business for sustainable growth. With that, I'll pass the call to Mike for further financial details.
Michael J. Pung: Thanks, Will, and good afternoon everyone. Today, I'll emphasize 3 points in my prepared comments: First, we had a solid fourth quarter delivering $186 million of revenue, a 16% increase over the same period last year. For the year, we delivered $676 million, an increase of 9% over fiscal '11. More importantly, as Will said, we saw growth across all product portfolio and throughout all geographies. We have set the bar extremely high for fiscal 2013. Second, for the fiscal year, we delivered $92 million in net income and $2.55 of GAAP earnings per share, increases over the prior year of 29% and 43%, respectively. Finally, our adjusted operating margins increased 400 basis points to 30% from the prior year. We had a number of non-recurring expenses that impacted our margins this quarter, and I'll walk through those, their total impact and what you should expect going forward. Now to speak more to revenue. Revenue for the quarter was $186 million, a $26 million increase over the prior year and a $26 million increase over the prior quarter. Full year revenue of $676 million was an increase of $57 million over last year. I'll break down the revenue into our 3 operating segments. The first segment, Decision Management Applications. Revenue from these applications was $120 million, up 22% from last quarter and up 23% versus the same period last year. While we saw strength across most of the portfolio, we achieved particularly strong results in our TRIAD and Falcon products, driven by software license sales and related implementation services. In addition, we recorded $4 million of revenue related to our acquisition of Adeptra, which closed in early September. The second segment is Scores. Overall, Scores revenue was $47 million, an increase of 4% from the same quarter last year and up 11% from the prior quarter. This increase is driven by the B2B Scores sold financial institutions. The third segment is Decision Management Tools. Revenue in this segment was $19 million, up 9% versus the prior year and down 4% versus the prior quarter. The increase from last year was driven primarily by several large sales of FICO Blaze Advisor and our optimization products. Looking at our revenue by region. This quarter's 73% of total revenue was derived from our Americas region, our EMEA region generated 20%, and the remaining 7% was from Asia-Pacific. Recurring revenue, derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter, represented 66% of total revenues versus 71% in the prior quarter. Consulting and implementation revenues were 18% of total revenues versus 20% in the prior quarter, and license revenues were 15% of total revenue as compared to 9% in the prior quarter. During this quarter, we recorded $29 million of license revenue compared to $15 million in the last quarter. This increase was driven by 6 large deals we signed in the quarter. As we've stated in the past, the timing of these large transactions is often difficult to predict. In this quarter, we closed more sizable transactions than any quarter in recent history. Now turning to bookings. We generated $31 million of current period revenue on bookings of $99 million, a 32% yield. This compares with $17 million of revenue on bookings of $58 million, a 29% yield on the prior quarter. The weighted average term for our bookings was 29 months this quarter compared to 16 months last quarter. Of the $99 million in bookings, 28% related to Fraud Solutions, 21% to Customer Management solutions, and 15% was related to Decision Management Tools. We had 19 booking deals in excess of $1 million, 7 of which exceeded $3 million. Transactional and maintenance bookings were 40% of total bookings this quarter versus 28% in the prior quarter. Professional services bookings were 34% this quarter versus 52% in the prior quarter. And finally, license bookings were 26% in this quarter versus 20% in the prior quarter. Now turning to expenses. Operating expenses totaled $145 million this quarter compared to $123 million in the prior quarter, up $22 million. Let me take you through this increase in depth. First, the acquisition of Adeptra, which was completed in early September, added about $4.5 million of costs, broken down between one month of ongoing operating expenses of $4 million and amortization expense of $500,000. We expect our total amortization expense to be about $12 million for the full fiscal year 2013. Second, we recorded restructuring and acquisition-related expenses of $5 million during the quarter. These one-time items relate to severance expense associated with realigning our resources, mainly within the product and technology organization and the cost related to the acquisition of Adeptra. Third, we incurred incremental cost of $8 million related to the revenue growth during the quarter, spread evenly between third party software cost, billable third-party consultants and additional incentives we accrued for sales commissions in our general bonus pool. Finally, the remaining $4.5 million is broken down between additional depreciation on our data center, which was recently put into service, and headcount related to costs associated with additional investments we are making to grow the business. Going forward, we expect operating costs in quarter 1 to be slightly lower than quarter 4, as we will take on the full quarter costs associated with the acquisition of Adeptra. As you can see on our Reg G schedule, non-GAAP operating margin before amortization, stock-based compensation and restructuring and acquisition activities, was 29% for the fourth quarter and 30% for the entire fiscal year, in line with our guidance and up from the 26% we reported in the fiscal '11. GAAP net income this quarter was $21 million, and we delivered $92 million for the full fiscal year. The effective tax rate was about 35% this quarter and about 33% for the full year. We expect the rate to be about 31% to 32% next year, depending on whether the R&D credit, tax credit is reinstated. Free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures and dividends paid, was $17 million or 9% of revenue compared to $16 million or 10% of revenue in the prior quarter. Free cash flow this quarter was impacted by the timing of receipts and payments, as well as the payment of Adeptra accounts payable around the time the acquisition closed. Moving on to the balance sheet. We have $94 million of cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet. This is down from $151 million last quarter mainly due to the acquisition of Adeptra. Our total debt is $504 million, with a weighted average interest rate of 6.1%. And the cost of our debt remains fairly fixed at about $8 million per quarter. The ratio of our total net debt to adjusted EBITDA is 2.2x, below the covenant level of 3x. Our total fixed charge coverage ratio is at 4.5x, well above the covenant level of 2.5x. We had no borrowings under our line of credit facility. In our fiscal year 2012, we repurchased 5.2 million shares of our stock at a total cost of $184 million or about $35.53 per share. We did not repurchase any shares during our fourth quarter, as we delevered our balance sheet after the acquisition of Adeptra. Since the recession began in September of 2008, we have reduced our share count from 49 million shares down to 35 million shares or a reduction of 28%. While we still have $150 million remaining on our current board authorization, we continue to evaluate and consider opportunities to acquire relevant technologies and products that advance our strategy or strengthen our portfolio and competitive position. I'll turn the call back now to Will to provide a view in the fiscal 2013.
William J. Lansing: Let me take a few minutes to discuss where we've been, and where we're headed. Over the past 2 years, we focused on growing our software businesses organically, while managing our expenses tightly, driving significantly improved operating results. We've also seen improvement in our Scores franchise, instep with a mostly improving U.S. economy. Our free cash flow was invested wisely and in an aggressive share repurchase plan, while we look for opportunities that made good strategic sense. During this past year, we identified opportunities to grow and diversify our business, and we are investing some of the margin expansion toward those areas, where we see the highest potential. We made 2 important acquisitions that will drive revenue growth in fiscal 2013, an additional margin improvement as we deliver the expected synergies. In short, we view fiscal 2013 as a year on which we will continue to put into place long-term growth initiatives. We're focused especially in 3 areas: First, we're diversifying our strong -- beyond our strong foundation and financial services into other industries, where analytics can generate great value; second, we've acquired SaaS offerings, while we're cloud-enabling FICO applications analytics and decisions. Together, these solved important customer problems in ways that are relatively quick, inexpensive and painless for our clients to implement and easy for us to sell; and third, we're advising and serving our clients as they grapple with the implications of big data, the vast new streams of information that are changing the way business is done around the world. Finally, we're are providing guidance today for what we expect in our fiscal year 2013. We expect revenues to be in the $740 million to $750 million range, an increase of 9% to 11% versus fiscal '12. Of that we expect the revenue from Adeptra products to be $55 million to $58 million. We expect net income to be at least $100 million on a GAAP basis, an increase of about 9%. Finally, we expect GAAP earnings per share of $2.80, an increase of 10%. This is based on our current diluted share count of around 36 million shares outstanding. I'll now turn the call back to Steve for Q&A.
Steven P. Weber: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we're ready now to take your questions. Leticia, please open the lines.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Carter Malloy from Stephens, Inc.
Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Can you remind us what you're actual rotations are for Adeptra's contribution to the model for 2013 in terms of revenue and expenses?
Michael J. Pung: Yes, Carter, so this is Mike. We're expecting Adeptra revenues to be on a full year basis next year around $55 million to $58 million. And we expect it to be GAAP accretive of around $0.02 to $0.03 per quarter, so about $0.09 to $0.10 for the full year. That includes about $6 million of incremental amortization expense related to the intangible assets.
Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Got it. So then externally of that then, where are the other incremental investments coming next year in terms of your P&L?
Michael J. Pung: So what we're planning to and we have begun to put some dollars into [Audio Gap] R&D function, in particular adding some features and functionalities around our business on the mobility side, which is an extension of what we're doing with Adeptra. We're also planning to invest, and we have started to invest in some areas around our fraud products by expanding the capabilities within that offering set.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Ty Lilja from Feltl and Company.
Ty M. Lilja - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division: I'm wondering if perhaps you can provide some color just on the impact to higher mortgage origination during the quarter, and how that affected your various lines of business. I was wondering if that was part of the reason for the bump in B2B stores?
William J. Lansing: Yes, Ty, great question. So we did see a nice increase [Audio Gap]
Ty M. Lilja - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division: Kind of a lift in Originations Solutions revenue in and applications.
William J. Lansing: A slight lift. Most of that, frankly, is driven from new license sales. But we saw modest increases on the Originations side on it on a sequential basis.
Ty M. Lilja - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division: And also wanted to ask I think your press release referred to the pre-configured Decision Management solutions. I think you guys were kind of talking about versions of those solutions aimed at smaller financial institutions. Where are you on that?
Michael J. Pung: We are very focused on taking our products and offerings and making them easier to implement and offering them on a SaaS basis. And so we're working our way to SaaS-enabling our product line.
Ty M. Lilja - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division: And finally, was just wondering if you could provide an update on what happened in your Marketing Solutions business this quarter.
Michael J. Pung: Yes, Marketing solutions revenue was up. I can give you a percentage. It was up in mid-single digit as we rolled on our new customer for the first full quarter. The third largest Retail Action Manager deal we did. Let me look and find the exact number. It's up roughly about 7% on a year-over-year basis, 4% sequentially.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And there are no further questions at this time. Do you have any closing remarks?
William J. Lansing: No, thank you. This concludes today's call. Thank you, all, for joining.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, you may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Kyle, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the FICO Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Weber, you may begin your conference.
Steven P. Weber: Thank you, Kyle. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining FICO's Third Quarter Earnings Call. I'm Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike Pung. You'll find on the Investor Relations portion of the FICO website a copy of today's news release, our Regulation G disclosure schedule and our financial highlights. While our press release describes financial results compared to the prior year, today management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterize as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular, in the Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. In order to provide additional information to investors, we will use certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, entitled Regulation G Disclosure, is available on the Investor page of our website under the Presentations tab. A replay of this webcast will be available through August 25, 2012. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
William J. Lansing: Thanks, Steve. Today, we announced the results of our third quarter of fiscal 2012. I'll briefly summarize those results and then discuss some of the exciting things we've been working on and what they mean for the growth of the business. I'm pleased to report we had a solid third quarter. Our revenue of $160 million was an increase of 7% over the same period last year. We delivered $21 million of net income and earnings of $0.59 per share versus $0.58 last year. I'm also pleased to report that we are increasing our full year guidance, which we'll detail later. As we've stated in prior discussions, we're continually weighing share repurchases against the possibility of acquisitions in order to achieve the greatest long-term return on capital. This quarter, we managed to do both. Mike will provide details on the share repurchases in a few minutes, but I'd like to talk about our acquisition this quarter of Entiera, which gives FICO a SaaS-based next-generation marketing automation platform. This is especially important in today's environment where marketing executives spend nearly as much on technology as CIOs as they struggle to keep up with rapidly evolving digital, social, mobile and interactive technologies and exploding volumes of structured and unstructured data. Since completing the acquisition in May, we've already made significant progress on integrating the Entiera platform with FICO's existing marketing decision management technologies. In fact, the acquisition has accelerated FICO's Marketing solutions product roadmap significantly. Soon, FICO will usher in a new era of analytically driven, big data multichannel campaign management, providing a combination unmatched in the industry today. In concert with the product integration, we've already begun migrating a number of large existing FICO customers to the new platform. This will enable these clients to benefit from a more functionally rich, efficient and high-performance campaign management solution. This acquisition will also serve as the vehicle for FICO to expand the reach of our marketing solutions into new industry verticals. The software-as-a-service delivery model we've acquired will also provide the means to deliver FICO's proven high-end marketing analytics products to mid-market clients in a highly competitive manner. As I said last quarter, we set the bar high as we evaluate potential acquisitions. I think Entiera provides a good illustration of what we look for. First, it's important that whatever we're acquiring must be able to be integrated quickly and efficiently with our existing product base, enhancing the functionality of our core products. Second, we look for opportunities to leverage our global sales force and extensive customer base. If we can find companies with products that provide our customers with additional capabilities that are closely adjacent to those of our current companies, we believe such an acquisition will help us take additional market share. Third, we look for products that are growing in terms of revenue and market share and have room for further growth. Finally, we keep a keen eye on valuation. And again, this is where we constantly weigh the value of acquisitions against investing in our own business, either through share buybacks or through internal development and operations. As I said last quarter, I'm convinced we're in a great position to capitalize on opportunities inherent in big data. You might not know it from the hype, but the real value in big data is not going to come from relaxing constraints on data storage and processing. The real value in big data lies in the ability to extract value from incremental data sets of increasingly marginal utility and ultimately make smarter business decisions. Nobody knows how to do that better than FICO, and we're moving quickly to seize the opportunity. So with that, I'll now pass the call to Mike for further financial details.
Michael J. Pung: Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll emphasize 3 points in my prepared comments. First, we had a solid third quarter, delivering $160 million of revenue, a 7% increase over the same period last year. And although we remain concerned about events in Europe, these concerns are balanced by continuing improvement in the U.S. scores business while our software pipeline is strengthening worldwide. Second, we've now delivered $71 million of net income year-to-date, about as much as what we delivered in all of fiscal 2011. And with the repurchases this quarter, we've now retired more than 5 million shares this fiscal year. Finally, we are increasing our annual guidance today. Even with lingering uncertainty in Europe, we believe we have sufficient visibility to be confident in increasing our revenue and net income and EPS ranges. So for the quarter, revenue was $160 million, a $10 million increase over the prior-year period and a $1 million increase over the prior quarter. I'll break down the revenue into our 3 reporting segments. The first segment, Decision Management applications. Revenue from these applications was $98 million, up 2% from last quarter and up 7% versus the same period last year. While we saw strength across most of the portfolio, we achieved particularly strong results in our TRIAD and IFM products, driven from software license sales and the related implementation services. Moving on to Scores. Overall, our scores revenue was $42 million, flat with the prior year and down 6% from the prior quarter. We trap -- we track the subsegments here by B2B, which are scores sold to financial institutions, and B2C, which are scores sold directly to consumers. The B2B scores subsegment performed very well, up 4% from the same quarter last year as we continue to see health in the business improve. Year-to-date, our B2B scores business is up 7% over the last year. Couple of highlights include our Originations have continued to steadily trend upward. This quarter, Originations revenue was up 13% over the prior year. This is driven primarily from auto and mortgage originations which were particularly strong. We continue to work with customers on the adoption of FICO 8, which is now being used by more than 8,300 lenders. And from an innovation standpoint, we recently introduced 2 products into the market: The newest FICO Score version in Canada, which was developed using recent Equifax credit data and includes mortgage data for the first time. It's based on the FICO 8 score blueprint, and shows up to 6x more lift than that offered by a typical score redevelopment. We also introduced a new high-performance consumer credit risk score, FICO Mortgage Score powered by CoreLogic, that is expected to improve the quality of lending decisions and increase the number of mortgage loans lenders make by evaluating traditional credit data from the national credit data repositories along with unique supplemental consumer credit data contained by CoreLogic in the core score. Finally, Decision Management tools. Revenue in this segment was $20 million, up 20% versus the prior year and an increase of 7% versus the prior quarter, making it the highest-revenue quarter for tools in more than 3 years. The increase was driven primarily from several large deals for FICO Blaze Advisor and our optimization products. Looking at our revenue by region, this quarter 75% of total revenue was derived from our Americas region, the same as the prior quarter. Our EMEA region generated 18% in both this and the prior quarter, and the remaining 77% was from Asia-Pacific. In terms of by revenue type, recurring revenue derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter represented 71% of total revenues versus 72% in the prior quarter; consulting and implementation revenues were 20% of total versus 19% in the prior quarter; and license revenues were 9% of total revenue, the same as last quarter. Now turning to bookings. We generated $17 million of current-period revenue on bookings of about $58 million at 29% yield. This compares with $18 million of revenue on bookings of $78 million, a 24% yield on the prior quarter. The weighted average term for our bookings was 16 months this quarter compared to 23 months in the prior quarter. Of the $58 million in bookings, 25% was related to tools, 22% was related to our origination solutions, 20% related to fraud and 12% related to customer management solutions. We had 8 booking deals in excess of $1 million, 2 of which exceeded $3 million. Transactional and maintenance bookings were 28% of total versus 37% in the prior quarter. Professional services bookings were 52% this quarter compared to 44% in the prior quarter. And finally, license bookings were 20% in this quarter versus 19% in the prior quarter. Operating expenses totaled $123 million this quarter, up $2 million from the prior quarter. Quarter 3 includes costs associated with the acquisition of Entiera, costs associated with increased personnel and a onetime true-up related to royalties paid to a third party. We expect operating costs in quarter 4 to be consistent with our third quarter as we absorb a full quarter for the acquisition and increased personnel expenses. As you can see in our Reg G schedule, non-GAAP operating margin before amortization and stock-based comp was 28% percent for the third quarter and is 38 -- and is 30% year-to-date, in line with our expectations. GAAP net income this quarter was $21 million, and the effective tax rate was about 31%. We expect the effective tax rate to be about 32% to 33% for the full fiscal year. In terms of free cash flow, we define it as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and dividends paid. Free cash flow for the quarter was $16 million or 10% of revenue compared to $36 million or 23% of revenue in the prior quarter. Free cash flow this quarter was impacted by the timing of receipts of payments, including a large quarterly tax payment and an extra payroll pay period during the month of June. Now moving on to the balance sheet, we have $151 million in cash and marketable securities. This is down $40 million from last quarter due to share repurchases and the acquisition of Entiera. Our total debt is $504 million, with a weighted average interest rate of 6.1%, and the cost of our debt remains fairly fixed at about $8 million per quarter. The ratio of our total net debt to adjusted EBITDA is 2x, which is below the covenant level of 3x. Our total fixed charge coverage ratio is at 4.3x, all above the covenant level of 2.5x. We continue to have no borrowings under our line of credit facility. We repurchased 836,000 shares in the third quarter at a total cost of $34 million or $40.71 per share. Our basic shares outstanding were $33.7 million at the end of the quarter, down from $37.1 million at the beginning of the year. The repurchases this quarter exhaust the board authorization from last fall. We continually evaluate the best way to deploy excess cash to maximize shareholder value and consider our share repurchase plan a very attractive use of our cash flow. And as we previously stated, we also regularly evaluate and consider opportunities to acquire relevant technologies and products that advance our strategy or strengthen our portfolio and competitive position. Finally, we are increasing the guidance we gave today at the beginning of the year. Based on our results and the visibility into our baseline and new deals in the fourth quarter, our new guidance is as follows. Revenue guidance has been increased to $650 million to $655 million for the year, up from the previously guided $640 million to $645 million. Net income guidance increased to $90 million to $93 million on a GAAP basis, up from the previously guided $86 million to $89 million. And GAAP earnings per share guidance has increased to $2.50 up to $2.60, an increase from the $2.45 to $2.55 we previously guided. As you recall, the original guidance was based on 35 million shares outstanding. We now believe our average share count for the full fiscal year will be closer to 36 million, primarily due to the dilution related to in-the-money options. These additional shares, about 1 million in total, are added to the total diluted share count when we compute EPS. With that, I'll turn the call back to Steve for question-and-answer.
Steven P. Weber: Thanks, Mike. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we're ready now to take your questions. Kyle, please open the line.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays Capital.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: So firstly, on the scores, so clearly, I mean, based on the commentary, I mean, the B2B business was up, I guess, 4% is what you said. So I just wanted to get some color on how, I guess, poorly the B2C segment performed. Because given the easy comp you had from last quarter and if everything seems to be sort of getting better from the second quarter that you had, why the total performance wasn't as good?
William J. Lansing: What we're doing in the B2C business is essentially rebuilding it. We've rebuilt some of the team there. We've moved the location into the heart of Silicon Valley where we think we can pick up the kind of talent that we want for a consumer-facing business like this. And so we don't see the decline that we've seen this quarter continuing for long. What we see is a rebuild in that business.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: So can you give us some numbers around how bad the decline was and relative to the last few quarters?
Michael J. Pung: Yes, let me give you an idea, Manav. This quarter on the B2C side, we delivered about $9.3 million of revenue. That compares to about $9.6 million in the second quarter, and first quarter was $9 million. So we basically landed on around $9 million to $9.5 million. And that's been our run rate as of recent on the B2C business as we're investing back into the organization.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And how about for the same quarter last year?
Michael J. Pung: Certainly, last quarter, third quarter B2C was at $10.3 million. So we're down about $1 million from same period last year.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And I guess just trying to understand the decline. Is that -- I mean, I guess, to some extent you said you're focused on, I guess, restructuring the business to some extent, but is most of that decline, I guess, retention-related, like people just not signing up for these things anymore?
William J. Lansing: Actually, our retention is improving but we've dramatically reduced our SEM efforts, our customer acquisition efforts, while we transition to a new platform and evaluate the strength and profitability of the programs. And so, as I said, I think we're in a rebuilding mode, meaning our analytics around it are getting better. We understand our programs better today than we did in the past. And we believe that we'll be in a position to ramp up our marketing spend and our customer acquisition efforts there in the future. Right now, we're running at a reasonably low customer acquisition SEM customer acquisition program and relying more on SCO.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And I guess what sort of timeline should we expect the refocus to start next year, next fiscal year or calendar year? Or how does that...
William J. Lansing: Well, I would say in the next fiscal year you can expect improvement.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And then on the M&A, I mean, clearly, Will, since you came in, I guess almost pretty quickly you made the first acquisition. I just wanted some color -- I guess 2 things. Firstly, what sort of timeline or goal should we be looking for in terms how well Entiera is being integrated and how that's helping, I guess, the marketing portfolio that you guys have? And the second part would be just sort of how would you describe the pipeline, whether it's the number of companies you have that you're looking at or just a general feel of what the opportunity looks like?
William J. Lansing: I think that probably the right way to evaluate it -- because what we're doing is we're integrating it very quickly. We're really going to market together. So the notion of kind of breaking out Entiera and looking at it separately is not a good way to look at this business. So I think the right way to evaluate the wisdom and successfulness of -- the success of this acquisition is to look a year from now at whether our marketing solutions business is stronger a year from now than it is today. Because that's how we think about it. And so we go to market together with them. If you think about what it is that we bought here, besides the terrific management team, we got really nice technology and a nice platform. We -- our solutions, our marketing solutions, are tremendous on the analytic side, but we -- I think we are best-in-class in if you want to think about it as segmentation of one and that kind of analytics. And what Entiera brings to the party is tremendous campaign management, the ability to have an interactive dialogue with the consumer that makes operational the analytics that we've put in place. And so taking those to market as a package, working with our clients together on that, we think is the right way to do it. We sell the products, our Retail Action Manager products, together with the Entiera Insight products. And we've actually -- we've only been owners of Entiera for a very short time, we've already sold our first deal together. So we are very bullish on the way this is going to work out.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then just generally on the health of the pipeline, the acquisition pipeline.
Michael J. Pung: So the health of the pipeline has been very good, before we bought Entiera and even now today of course. We have several large deals that we are working on with respect to our PMM and our marketing group. I'm not planning to break out any specific numbers at this point in time, but the pipeline and marketing is very strong, Manav, if that's what your question is.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carter Malloy from Stephens.
Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division: So another quarter of sequential uptake in the tools business. Should we sustain this type of growth and lift it forward? Or are you looking for the acceleration to come more on the application side of business?
William J. Lansing: It's a fairly balanced pipeline we have, Carter, between tools and apps, and so I wouldn't take one or the other and accelerate it per se. Our tools business, as you know, can kind of bounce around and be lumpy based upon large deals that happened to get signed. And we signed a couple of very nice big deals this quarter and, in part, that's what pushed our revenue up to the $20 million. We also are in the midst of a lot of implementation work, and services revenue on the tool side has been very strong. So I think the guidance we laid out at the beginning of the year for all of our software companies is probably the right way to look at both of them.
Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then going forward, and I asked this and you're probably going to say no anyways, but looking at 2013 or going forward for next 12 or 18 months, especially taking into account the lumpiness of the business like you said and the European exposure, do you guys anticipate that we can sustain these types growth rates for the software side of business?
William J. Lansing: Well, we'll be -- we're in the middle of doing our planning for next fiscal year. We feel pretty good about our fourth quarter and pipeline beyond that. And our intention in the long term remains the same as it was when we started the year out, which is the growth rates in the 5% to 7% being sustainable, and we don't have anything to change today with regards to that. And when we deliver our fourth quarter results here in a few months, we will update everybody on the guidance at that point.
Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then one more model question for you, Mike. We've seen R&D normalizing back out a little bit. And as we think about that over the next year or 2, I think you've spoken publicly a little bit about this already, but should we be looking at R&D as a percent of revenue in the 9% or even 10% range or even higher than that going forward? Or should we hold it back, continue holding it back?
William J. Lansing: Yes, so good question. When we took the restructuring and drove -- 1.5 years ago and we drove some of the margin expansion, some of -- a couple of percentage points came out of the R&D line. At that point, we made the comment that we expected to invest some of that margin expansion back into the business modestly as opportunities arose. A little bit is coming back in right now. We are at about 9%. I still think over the near term, 9% to 10% is probably a good way to look at it from your modeled perspective.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Ty Lilja from Feltl and Company.
Ty M. Lilja - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division: First, I was curious about the TRIAD upgrade announced last week. I was wondering if you could talk about the features of that and kind of what the outlook is for that product line.
Michael J. Pung: Sure, Ty. This is Mike here. We had a great quarter at TRIAD. Sold several deals this quarter and had a very strong quarter. We recently released TRIAD 8.6. In simple terms, what 8.6 does is it provides our customers with the ability to do more advanced modeling and more detailed modeling around scenarios that underlie the strategies that they're trying to execute on. We increased the number of potential scenario opportunities tenfold, from literally 1,000 to 10,000 different scenarios, making the application itself more powerful and flexible to the banks. We also, in coordination with that, expanded some functionality that allows our clients to manage small business portfolios at a much more granular level than what the prior version of TRIAD did. So generally a right-of-dot release, but a very powerful release for those who are modeling many, many different types of scenarios as they are looking for ways to grow profitably.
Ty M. Lilja - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division: Do you think the upgrade gives you the potential to generate some more revenue from that business? Or is it kind of holding on to what you have and waiting for transactions to pick up?
Michael J. Pung: Well, I think it's a little of both. I mean, we obviously have a very big TRIAD installation base, and credit card growth will drive the volumes just organically within the base. This functionality provides some additional features that keeps us way ahead of the market in terms of any competition and hits the sweet spot of some of the banks who are looking at managing the profitability of their portfolios, which is increasingly a bigger and bigger priority.
Ty M. Lilja - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay, sure. And also, I was wondering if you could just give an update on where you're at in the Falcon upgrade. I know it's been kind of an ongoing process.
Michael J. Pung: Yes, we went through a couple of major upgrades with Falcon last year. That was the heavy Falcon upgrade year, if you will, for us. We continue to add functionality right of dot. I believe we're at 6.1.4, and we probably have a couple of other right-of-dot upgrades for the remaining part of this calendar year that are basic functionality that's building out this suite of products. But we don't really have any major upgrade that's on at least the near 6-month horizon.
Ty M. Lilja - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And I was wondering too, could you just -- if there's any new news around your health insurance fraud product.
Michael J. Pung: Sure. Our Insurance Fraud Manager product is performing very well. We had a very large sale this quarter through one of our processors, and we have several others that are in the works. And the product is performing very well. We're continuing to do again, right-of-dot upgrades and pushing the distribution channels. So we had a real good quarter in IFM.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time.
Steven P. Weber: Thanks, Kyle. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for joining.
William J. Lansing: Thank you.
Operator: You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this is the operator. I would like to welcome everyone to the FICO's Second Quarter Earnings Call. Thank you. Mr. Steve Weber, you may begin.
Steven P. Weber: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining FICO's second quarter earnings call. I'm Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike Pung. You'll find on the Investor Relations portion of the FICO website a copy of today's news release, our Regulation G Disclosure schedule and our financial highlights. While our press release describes financial results compared to the prior year, today, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business.  Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements may involve many uncertainties that cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular, in the Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team.  In order to provide additional information to investors, we will use certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. A reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, entitled Regulation G Disclosure, is available on the Investor page of our website, under the Presentations tab. A replay of this webcast will be available through May 25, 2012.  Now I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.
William J. Lansing: Thanks, Steve. Today we announced the results of our second quarter fiscal 2012. I'd like to start by briefly summarizing those results and then offer my observations from my first 90 days at FICO.  I'm pleased to report we had a solid second quarter. Our revenue of $160 million was an increase of 4% over the same period last year. We delivered $20 million of net income versus $8 million last year and earnings of $0.55 per share versus $0.19 last year. We also continued to produce strong free cash flows, $36 million this quarter versus $22 million in the same quarter last year. Mike will get into the numbers in more detail in a few minutes. But first, I'd like to share my thoughts on where we currently stand and where we are going.  Over the past 3 months, I've had the opportunity to travel our offices around the world. We have an exceptionally smart, dedicated team of people who foresee exciting opportunities ahead for our business. I've also met with customers and I've got a deeper understanding of the value they get from FICO solutions and how they want to partner with us to tackle their toughest challenges. And I've come away very impressed with the strength of the company, its people, its products and its prospects for even greater success.  We have the strongest set of products in IT, with high barriers to entry. Products like the FICO Score, Falcon Fraud Manager and TRIAD are deeply embedded into the financial services industry and are recurring high-margin businesses. FICO  Retail Action Manager studies oceans of transaction data to determine not only what customers are most likely to buy but when, insight that our customers find extremely valuable. So we're looking closely at ways to offer this kind of value to an even broader number of retailers.  The product rationalization and restructuring that the company has undertaken in recent years has resulted in a business model that provides strong margins and operating leverage that propels earnings with even modest revenue growth. In a global market place, talent is the ultimate competitive advantage. And as I mentioned earlier, FICO has an exceptionally talented, dedicated workforce. We have over 200 analytic scientists on staff, with analytics centers of excellence in the U.S., U.K. and India. Our analysts work with dozens of proprietary and innovative modeling technologies, from genetic algorithms and neural network to Bayesian algorithms and experimental design.  In contrast to many players, new handle that are entering the analytics space, we specialize in real-world analytics solutions that solve specific real-world business problems. That's why in our discussions with clients, FICO always leads with the business problem, not with the technology.  What makes us very different from others is that we have great technology with a proven track record. We've developed proprietary technology for analyzing large data sets to develop predictive models. The results from analytic products transform entire industries. Our analytics that predict individual behavior protect 2/3 of the world's credit cards, and drive more than $10 billion lending decisions a year in the U.S. alone.  New entrants into the predictive analytics marketplace are jumping on the big data bandwagon, announcing that is now possible to express human behavior mathematically. FICO has been pioneering and perfecting this science since 1956. With the explosion of data available today, I'm convinced we are in a great position to the make the most of the opportunities inherent in Big Data. In summary, FICO is well positioned for growth. We'll continue to refine our strategy and execute against that strategy better and faster than our competitors. In the meantime, we continue to operate profitably and generate significant cash flows. This quarter, we repurchased 2.5 million shares, as we continue to return value to our shareholders. We continue to view repurchases as a good use of excess cash, and we'll evaluate other opportunities as appropriate.  Finally, we made a separate announcement today regarding some changes to the executive management team, and I'd like to take a minute to recap that announcement. I mentioned earlier how impressed I've been by the depth and breadth of talent at FICO. I also mentioned the growing demand for Big Data analytics, an opportunity that FICO is extremely well positioned to pursue. So naturally, I've been thinking about how to develop the management team so we can see these exciting opportunities in the months ahead. I'm, therefore, pleased to announce several successions that I believe will enable us to accelerate our movement in that direction.  First, Stuart Wells, who has been consultant with FICO for the last 2 years, is assuming the role of EVP and Chief Technology Officer, effective immediately. Stuart has a very impressive background in driving innovation and commercializing technologies for Sun Microsystems, Avaya and other technology businesses. In his work with FICO, he's been instrumental in the turnaround of our Professional Services business. Stuart replaces Deborah Kerr, who will serve in a consultative capacity toward departure from the company at the end of the year. Charlie Ill, who's transformed our sales, services and marketing organization and rekindled top line growth since he joined us in 2010, has announced his intention to retire at the end of this fiscal year. Charlie has built a very strong organization and from it emerges a natural successor, Mike Gordon, who's been running our EMEA business for the last 3 years. Mike has been with FICO since 2005, during which time, he's demonstrated his ability to lead sales and services teams to meet or exceed their targets, despite significant macroeconomic obstacles. This summer, I'll come back from London to our New York office in preparation for assuming responsibility for global sales, beginning on October 1. I'm pleased to announce that Charlie has agreed to stay actively involved with the business through February 2013 to help ensure a smooth transition.  In addition to these 2 changes, I'm happy to announce that Mike Pung has been promoted to Executive Vice President. Mike has reintroduced a high degree of rigor to our financial operations since he was named SVP and CFO in November of 2010. And I'm pleased to recognize his contributions to the business with this latest promotion.  Finally, as announced earlier this month, Jim Wehmann has joined FICO as EVP and Head of our Scores business. Jim brings a body of experience as an accomplished senior executive in financial services, retail and technology businesses. And he rounds out what I believe to be an exceptionally strong executive management team, that will lead us to new levels of profitable growth in the months and years to come.  So with that, I'll now pass the call to Mike for further financial details.
Michael J. Pung: Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll emphasize 3 key points in my prepared comments. First, we had a solid second quarter, delivering $160 million of revenue, a 4% increase over the same period last year. A pipeline in our software businesses is strong, and we are executing against these opportunities. And our Scores business is improving with the U.S. economy. Second, this translated into a 158% increase in net income over last year's second quarter, which included a restructuring charge and a 63% improvement in free cash flow. Since our restructuring last year, our financial performance has improved dramatically. Finally, we are reiterating our annual guidance today. While we're feeling better about delivering the high end of guidance, we maintain a conservative outlook in light of the economic uncertainties in Europe.  As I said, revenue for the quarter was $160 million, a $7 million increase over the prior year and an $11 million decrease over the prior quarter. I'll break down the revenue into our 3 reporting segments.  The first segment, Decision Management Applications, our business software used by our clients to understand and predict consumer behavior in order to make smart decisions over a customer life cycle. Revenue from these applications was $96 million, down 13% from last quarter when we had some large license renewals, and flat versus the same period in the prior year. This quarter included 4 Debt Manager 8 deals.  The second segment, Scores, which consists of predictive analytics used to assess risk. Revenue was up 8% from the prior year and 4% from the prior quarter. As you know, we track 2 subsegments here: B2B Scores sold at financial institutions and B2C Scores sold directly to consumers.  The B2B Scores subsegment performed well, up 12% from the same quarter last year, as we continue to see the health of business improve with the easing of credit markets. This quarter's revenue included a large project we contracted with a major U.S. customer. In partnership with the credit bureau, we delivered historical scores that aided our customer in performing economic modeling and analysis of its various portfolios. While this project is the first of its kind, we believe it's an example of finding a significant new market for our flagship product and are looking for new ways to offer the same value to other customers who may have similar needs.  Other highlights include a very strong originations trend, with revenue in North America up 14% over prior year, driven primarily by auto and mortgage; continued interest in adoption of FICO 8, which is now being used by more than 7,600 lenders; and our latest innovations, strategic default for the mortgage industry and the FICO Medication Adherence for the health care industry, are gaining traction in the market with validations underway.  The third segment is Decision Management Tools, which consist of rules management, modeling and optimization products, embedded within our applications and also sold standalone to our clients. Revenue in this Tools segment was $19 million, up 19% versus the prior year and up 8% versus the prior quarter. The increase was driven primarily by several large sales of FICO Blaze Advisor and an increase in related implementation services.  Looking at our revenue by region, this quarter's 75% of total revenue was derived from our Americas region compared to 74% in the prior quarter. Our EMEA region generated 18% compared to 20% in the prior quarter and the remaining 7% was from Asia Pacific compared to 6% in the prior quarter.  By type of revenue, recurring revenue, which is derived from transactional and maintenance sources, for the quarter represented 72% of total revenue versus 67% in the prior quarter. Consulting and implementation revenues were 19% of total versus 17% in the prior quarter, and license revenues were 9% of total revenue versus 16% last quarter.  Now turning to bookings. We generated $18 million of current period revenue on bookings of $78 million, or a 24% yield. This compares to $13 million of revenue on bookings of $59 million, a 22% yield last quarter. The weighted average term for our bookings was 23 months compared to 22 months in the prior quarter. Of the $78 million in bookings, 22% was related to our collections and recovery solutions, 18% was related to Decision Management Tools and 15% related to each -- each to Customer Management and Fraud solutions. We had 13 booking deals in excess of $1 million, 3 of which exceeded $3 million.  Transactional and Maintenance bookings were 37% of total this quarter versus 33% in the prior quarter. Professional Services bookings were 44% this quarter versus 46% last quarter. And finally, License bookings were 19% in this quarter versus 21% in the prior quarter.  Turning to our expenses. Operating expenses totaled $121 million this quarter, up about $3 million from the prior quarter. This quarter includes the full impact of our wage increases that took effect in December, along with the additional payroll benefit cost.  As you can see in our Reg G schedule, non-GAAP operating margin, which is before amortization and stock-based comp, was 28% for the second quarter and is 31% year-to-date.  GAAP net income this quarter was $20 million, with an effective tax rate of about 33%, which increased from the prior quarters due to both the expiration of the R&D credit and some additional foreign tax expense. We expect the effective tax rate to be around 32% to 33% in fiscal year '12, slightly higher than we previously communicated, primarily due to the foreign tax item. In terms of free cash flow, we define it as cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures and dividends paid. Free cash flow for the quarter was $36 million or 23% of revenue compared to $33 million or 19% of revenue in the prior quarter.  Moving on to the balance sheet. We have $191 million in cash and marketable securities, down $41 million from last quarter, mainly due to share repurchases, up by the cash flow we generated. Our total debt remains at $512 million with a weighted-average interest rate of 6.1% and our cost of debt is fairly fixed at about $8 million per quarter. The ratio of our total net debt to adjusted EBITDA is 1.8x, well below the covenant level of 3x. And our total fixed charge coverage ratio is 4.4x, well above our covenant level of 2.5x. We continue to have no borrowings under our line of credit facility.  We repurchased 2.5 million shares of our stock in quarter 2 at a total cost of $99.4 million or $40.34 per share. Our basic shares outstanding were 34 million at the end of the quarter, down from about 37 million at the beginning of the year. We continually evaluate the best way to deploy excess cash, to maximize shareholder value and consider our share repurchase plan, a very attractive use of our cash flow. We also regularly evaluate and consider opportunities to acquire relevant technologies and products, that advance our strategy or strengthen our portfolio and competitive position.  We are reiterating our guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year. And based on our current view of our business momentum, we have growing confidence that we can meet the high end of that guidance. As a reminder, our guidance is as follows: revenues of $640 million to $645 million or 3% to 4% increase for the year compared to fiscal year '11; net income of $86 million to $89 million on a GAAP basis, up 19% to 24% from the $72 million of net income in fiscal '11; and GAAP earnings per share of $2.45 to $2.55, which was based on 35 million shares outstanding, an increase of 37% to 42% versus prior year.  On this last point, let me take a moment to discuss our share count. In quarter 2, our fully diluted shares outstanding for the purposes of computing earnings per share was about $2 million higher -- or 2 million shares higher than our actual ending basic share count. Much of this difference is due to the increase in our share price over the past 6 months, which in turn drives dilution related to end of money options. These additional shares, which are 1.2 million in total, are added into the total diluted share count when computing EPS, making our average share count for the year harder to estimate. However, because we believe we will end up closer to the high end of guidance on revenue and net income, we are confident we will still be able to deliver on our EPS guidance with the additional dilution.  I'll now turn the call back to Steve for Q&A.
Steven P. Weber: Thanks, Mike. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we're ready now to take your questions. Operator, please open the lines.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: One question on the Scores business. Obviously, you talked about how Originations are good, obviously driven by autos and mortgages. Can you maybe give a little color on what you're seeing on the -- on I guess, the credit card side, which I believe is the biggest part of your business?
William J. Lansing: It is, Manav. Credit card is the biggest side. We did see most of the volume increases last quarter derived from auto and mortgage originations as we described. Credit card is hanging in there. It's not growing quite at the same rate. Definitely, it was growing in the prior quarter. But basically, it's remaining about flat on a quarter-over-quarter basis.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: So, I guess, maybe another way to ask the question, is there any reason -- I guess, nobody is seeing growth really there, but is there any reason to believe there could be a fall-off relative to, I guess, what you're seeing today?
William J. Lansing: No, there's no reason to believe that. I mean, the credit card business does drive a large part of the volumes. And overall, it continues to drive a large part. It's simply a matter of when some of the marketing activities find their way into the originations cycle, as we talked about historically.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then is there -- can you give us a size or a way to quantify what that -- the large project was that you mentioned with the B2B customer and -- it sounds like something where I would have thought a lot of people were using your Scores before, like how is this different?
William J. Lansing: Yes. So the way it's different, I'll start with that. The way it's different is it was a project that was done to evaluate some broader economic models across historical set of portfolios within a large bank, as opposed to using the Score in its historical form to render credit. So it was a somewhat of a one-time project. It might be recurring in nature, but it was a very major undertaking for our customer. And that required our customer to pull a significant number of Scores and compare the results over a year-to-year period. The size of the deal, why we don't quantify any specific deals for any client, it was a 7-figure deal. And it did drive the majority of the growth on a year-over-year basis in our B2B business.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. All right, fair enough. And, I guess, maybe a question for William. Just -- you gave us your quick take on what you'd seen in the 3 months since you took -- maybe just to understand in the context of all the different management changes that are going on and I think even before you came, there was a lot of different hires and some people retiring. Maybe just some way to try and frame what the employee situation, I guess, like you've done with a lot of these hires and retirees or is there more to come?
William J. Lansing: It's a good question and a fair question. I think you have to take a hard look at what we've done here and it's really -- if you look at it, what we're really doing is a lot of internal succession. So like Gordon, who's taking over the revenue operation from Charlie Ill at the end of the year. He's an internal guy who's done a fabulous job for us. He's been with us since 2005. And so that's a very smooth kind of a transition. And Charlie will be with us through the end of the year. On the technology side, technology and product, we have a good portion to put Stuart Wells into that role and, besides his very impressive external credentials, he has been helping us internally for the last 2 years over on the professional services side. But his real background is on the product and technology side. And so we're pretty fortunate to be able to promote from within. And I would say that I'm very proud of the team that we have, and I'm really excited about the way it's coming together and coalescing. I think we've got the people we need to go get some of the opportunity ahead of us. I can't say there will never be another change, but we're pretty happy with the team that we have.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Ernst with Deutsche Bank.
Nandan Amladi - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Nandan Amladi on behalf of Tom. A couple of questions. Last quarter, you talked about the new insurance fraud product. Can you characterize what percentage of bookings or any other quantification of how that product is doing and how the pipeline is looking?
Michael J. Pung: Yes, sure. So if you're taking about the Insurance Fraud Manager application from the -- about a year ago when we delivered it, we're gaining good traction with it. We are up and live, had our largest processor, Emdeon. They're starting to sign up new customers. We are starting to see some revenue flow in from Emdeon and, of course, we have about 6 or 7 direct customers from it. During the quarter, there were no particular large deals that we signed on the IFM side, but we have a very strong pipeline. And I would expect to see something come through in the back half of the year.
Nandan Amladi - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And one follow-up, if I might. Your buyback authorization announced in November was for $150 million. It looks like you've completed that based on what you've done in the first and the second quarter. Any plans for further buybacks? You didn't make mention of that in your script.
Michael J. Pung: We actually still have $34 million remaining under that buyback plan. Some of the shares we bought back this quarter were under an old authorization. So there's still $34 million left under the current door plan. And our board discusses allocation of capital, including our buyback plan at all of their meetings, and we have an upcoming board meeting. And I imagine it'll be a topic.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carter Malloy with Stephens Inc.
Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Well, maybe you could talk a little bit more about your experience there at the company since you've been here. Clearly, some leadership changes in place but maybe operationally, what if, if any, will change from your predecessor's strategy?
William J. Lansing: I don't think you should look for big changes. I think what we have is -- if you go through our -- the portfolio of things that we have, on the Scores side, we have new leadership with Jim Wehmann and we have an existing Scores team that's very strong. And I think with the combination of the 2, the fresh leadership with Jim, as well as the very strong people we already have, sets us up for growth in that business. And we're optimistic -- cautiously optimistic about growth in that business. On the application side, you -- I'm sure you know the status of our products. We have a bunch of new products in the market that are, after years of work, are finally ready for prime time and are now being deployed. They're being sold into the big customers. And so operationally, what we have to do is continue to work them up there, get them implemented. And we're pretty optimistic about the way that's all going. Falcon was kind of the introduction last year. And this year, we're on Originations Manager and Debt Manager. We have new products. IFM is in the sense a new product and Retail Action Manager, again, in the sense a new product, and gaining traction. Action Manager is getting a lot of traction actually. And so, again, operationally, how do we organize ourselves internally to deliver to the market what it really wants, where there's clearly an appetite for it. We're working on those things. But I don't anticipate any dramatic changes operationally.
Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then back on the Scores side of the business, as you got 7-figure deal in B2B, so that puts your growth sort of closer to flat-ish there. And then what -- clearly, I think there's some decline in B2C. But what happened in the rest of B2B, as well, if Origination through auto and mortgage was up 14%?
Michael J. Pung: Origination -- Carter, Origination and Account Manager were both up on a year-over-year basis, and that was somewhat of an offset on the pre-screen side, which can come in more lumpy forms when marketing initiatives are gone. So when you net all that all out, the kind of the baseline Scores business is up slightly. And it was furthered by some of the project work I described.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Horn with Morningstar.
Brett Horn - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Yes. So you talked about in your comments -- I just want to see if I can get some color on this. You mentioned that repurchases you still see that as a good use of cash. But, I guess, with the progress that you've made in restructuring the business, would you say that there's increased willingness to consider acquisitions today than, say, 1 year or 2 ago?
William J. Lansing: I would say that 1 year or 2 ago, we made acquisitions -- small technology, tuck-in acquisitions. And we absolutely remain interested in doing that. Wherever we can find technology that we're going to acquire at a fair price that advances kind of a bigger strategic initiative, we do it. We tend to do it. We did it to support our Tools business with cash not long ago. And I could foresee doing that in the future. That said, we are really in love with our own prospects. And we are -- we're quite -- we like where we're positioned. And so in terms of investing in ourselves, relative to investing in others, that's a hard call to take the money and put it into -- meaningful money into acquisitions. That's not to say we'll never do it. It just has to -- it has to meet a high threshold. And so are we more interested in doing it than in the past? Where there's opportunities, we're going to do it. And we're going to continue to hold them to this high standard. It's got to be at least as good as investing in ourselves.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Ty Lilja from Feltl and Company.
Ty M. Lilja - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division: First question, I think you had a third customer coming online with Retail Action Manager. I'm just wondering how that was going?
Michael J. Pung: We do. We have a third client, and we expect them to be on live towards the latter part of this quarter. Implementation is well under way. It's going very well. And we're scheduled to go live with them this quarter, as we had planned in the beginning.
Ty M. Lilja - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay, sure. You're talking about just the traction you're getting in that business. Any new customer wins or prospects? Or are you just kind of gaining more share at your distinct customers?
Michael J. Pung: One of the things that happened this last quarter is we had a -- actually at the end of the year, we had a cross-sell to an existing customer to a broader part of their portfolio. And that went live towards the latter part of our second quarter, starting to gain additional volumes, if you will, from that effort. So the product is coming along very well. It's working very well for the customers that we have it installed for, and our pipeline remains pretty good for us as well.
Ty M. Lilja - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay, sure. And I think you guys had a little weakness in the Customer Manager product last quarter. Did that continue this quarter?
William J. Lansing: Yes. TRIAD volumes had declined historically through the recession as credit card accounts were being closed. And we're starting to -- the volume levels were getting smaller. We had a couple of very large deals that we signed in the second quarter with end-users for TRIAD and they're signed under license arrangements. And we actually had a very strong TRIAD quarter, and we have a lot of interest in TRIAD and markets outside the U.S. right now in our pipeline.
Ty M. Lilja - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay, sure. And then just thinking about some of these new product you're working on, particularly ones that have following different industries like Insurance Fraud, Medication Adherence, some of the other stuff you're working on. When you look at that from like a potential financial impact perspective over the next, call it, 12 to 18 months, what's kind of a -- which products do you think would have the biggest financial impact on your results?
Michael J. Pung: Well, our ability to scale on the Scores side is more challenging because of the distribution footprint we have for Scores. But once we begin to even scale modestly on Scores products, like strategic default or medication inheritance, they carry very high margins. So even small amounts of revenue can drive a lot of leverage from those products. But right now, within our current guidance numbers, we don't have any dramatic shifts in the revenue related to those new products. As it relates to the application side, Retail Action Manager tends to drive very strong revenue. And when we have our third client go live in the third quarter, I think we'll see some noticeable increase in revenue, probably at lower margins than you would in Scores. But we'll see some revenue growth on that end. In the Insurance Fraud Manager, to some degree, is tightly tied to our partners' ability to market and sell those products into their own customer base. So I would say, in terms of rank order, Retail Action Manager will see more immediate lift in revenue and behind that, will come the other products.
Ty M. Lilja - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay, sure. And then just a quick question about the strategic default product. I think in the -- are you getting any sense from your customers that might have a bit of a sense of urgency around strategic defaults? It just feels like that's a pretty immediate problem they have.
William J. Lansing: It is a very immediate problem. In fact, we've issued a press release, I think over the course of the last quarter, that quantified the number of potential homes that are under water. And risk strategic default and the number is greater than 10 million. I don't remember exactly what. But it's greater than 10 million mortgages out there. We're working with over a handful of customers right now, validating the quality of the Score and sharing that the proof of value meets the criteria that they're looking for. And we would anticipate, sometime in the future, that banks will begin to adopt the Score. But right now, we're going through the validation cycle.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Rob, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the FICO First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference call.
Steven P. Weber: Thank you, Rob. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining FICO's first quarter earnings call. I'm Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Mark Greene; CFO, Mike Pung; and Will Lansing, our newly appointed CEO. You'll find on the Investor Relations portion of the FICO website a copy of today's news release, our Regulation G Disclosure schedule and our financial highlights. While our press release describes financial results compared to the prior year, today, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular, in the Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team.  In order to provide additional information to investors, we will use certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, entitled Regulation G Disclosure, is available on the Investor page of our website under the Presentations tab. A replay of this webcast will be available through February 27, 2012.  Now I'll turn the call over to Mark Greene.
Mark N. Greene: Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon. Today, we announced the results for our fiscal first quarter of 2012. In addition, we announced that I'm retiring as CEO, but will remain with FICO in an advisory role. Will Lansing has been named Chief Executive Officer and will assume those duties effective tomorrow, January 27. Will has a 30-year track record in the technology industry, and has been a member of the FICO Board for the past 6 years. Will is joining us on today's call, and he'll have some remarks in a few moments. I look forward to working with him through a seamless transition. We'll take your questions after our prepared remarks. But first, I'll summarize the quarterly results, and Mike Pung will then provide financial details.  I'm pleased to report that we have a strong start to our fiscal year 2012. Our revenue of $170 million was the highest since the fourth quarter of 2008, and with an increase of 9% over the same period last year. We delivered $30 million of net income versus $16 million last year and earnings of $0.81 per share versus $0.40 per share last year.  We also continue to produce strong free cash flows, $33 million this quarter versus $31 million last year. All 3 segments of our Decision Management portfolio grew in the quarter. The first segment is our Decision Management applications or business offer used by clients to understand and predict consumer behavior in order to make smart decisions over customer life cycle. Revenue from these applications was solid this quarter, up 13% both sequentially and year-over-year. This is a particularly strong quarter in our Fraud Management Application business, which saw a year-over-year revenue growth of more than 50% due to several large term license renewals.  Our second segment is Scores, which consists of predictive analytics used to assess risk. Overall Scores revenue was up 4% from the prior year. We track 2 subsegments here, business-to-business or B2B, which are Scores sold to financial institutions, and business-to-consumer or B2C, which is Scores sold directly to consumers at myFICO.com on a direct basis or as Scores sold indirectly to consumers through bureau partners.  The B2B Scores subsegment performed well, up 6% from the same quarter last year, making it our best first quarter since 2009. We continue to invest in this business and are beginning to see the results in both our core business, as well as our innovations that will provide new revenue streams.  Highlights for the quarter include the following: Revenues from Scores sold across all parts of the life cycle, acquisitions, Originations and account management were up year-over-year. Scores sold for acquisition or marketing purposes to solicit new customers were up 14% year-over-year. Second, market adoption of FICO 8, which is the latest vintage of our classic Score continues to grow. 7,500 lenders have now standardized on FICO 8, accounting for over half of our revenues. And thirdly, we're gaining good traction on 2 recent Score innovations, particularly the FICO Medication Adherence Score for the healthcare industry and our strategic default solution for the mortgage industry.  The B2C Scores subsegment saw a small revenue decline in the quarter of 1% versus the prior year. This week, we announced the introduction of a Spanish language website as part of our ongoing efforts to expand credit literacy and empowerment to all U.S. consumers. This website, which is the Spanish version of myFICO.com, is the first website where some 34 million Spanish-speaking consumers in the U.S. can obtain their personal credit report, FICO Score and analysis all in Spanish. We're committed to serving this consumer marketplace and are continuing looking for innovative ways to grow this business.  Our third business segment is Decision Management Tools, which consist of rule management, modeling and optimization products, both embedded within our applications and also sold standalone to clients building their own applications. Revenue in this Tool segment was up 1% versus the prior year and the prior quarter.  During the quarter, we announced an upgrade to our business rural management tool called Blaze 7, with a groundbreaking visualization capability that makes it easier to understand and manage complex rule sets. This visualization feature of Blaze 7 is helping financial institutions to explain their complex lending and risk management policies to bank examiners.  Turning finally to our performance by geography, all 3 of our regions grew during the quarter on a year-over-year basis. Europe, Middle East and Africa was up by 25%, Asia Pacific was up by 11% and the Americas grew 6% over last year. While we continue to be wary of macroeconomic challenges especially in Europe, we're encouraged that we've been able to deliver strong results even in these volatile and uncertain times.  In summary, we're pleased with our first quarter results. We are well on track to meeting our fiscal 2012 guidance, and we believe this quarter demonstrates a considerable operating leverage that our company can deliver when we achieve top line revenue growth.  Now let me pass the call to Mike Pung for further financial details.
Michael J. Pung: Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a very good first quarter and demonstrated what we've been saying since we restructured a year ago, that our business model provides significant operating leverage.  This quarter, we delivered $170 million of revenue, a 9% increase over the same period last year, and this translated into an 87% increase in net income and 105% increase in earnings per share as we realized the benefit from our share repurchase program. This leverage enabled us to post a non-GAAP operating margin of 34% this quarter, a 500 basis point increase from quarter 4. While we believe margins for the rest of the year will be closer to 30%, this quarter's results show what is possible when we have spikes in revenue. As we've stated in the past, we're actively pursuing and winning larger deals, and the timing of those deals can cause lumpiness in our license revenues from quarter to quarter. This quarter, we signed some very large deals, which carried very little incremental cost. Now I'll discuss the quarter in more detail. Revenue was $170 million, a $10 million increase over the prior quarter and a $14 million increase over the prior year period. Applications revenue was $110 million, up 13% over the prior quarter and the prior year. Scores revenue was $43 million, down 5% over the prior quarter but up 4% over the prior year. Tools revenue was $18 million, essentially flat when compared to both the prior quarter and the prior year period.  By region this quarter, 74% of total revenue was derived from our Americas region, compared to 75% in the prior quarter. Our EMEA region generated 20% versus 18% in the prior quarter and the remainder of 6% was from Asia-Pacific compared to 7% in the prior quarter.  By revenue type, recurring revenue, which is derived from transactional and maintenance sources, represented 67% of total revenues versus 72% in the prior quarter. Consulting and implementation revenues were 17% of total versus 20% in the prior quarter and license revenues were 16% of total revenue versus 8% in the prior quarter.  The year-over-year increase in license revenue was primarily due to 2 very large term license deals for our Falcon Fraud Manager product. As I've mentioned in the past, our customers will occasionally request a term license rather than a usage-based fee. And in these instances, we recognized the revenue when the license is signed and paid. Although our guidance does not assume similar deals of this size, we expect license revenues as a percent of total revenue to increase during the year.  We generated $13 million of current period revenue on bookings of $59 million or a 22% yield. This compares with $15 million of revenue on bookings of $112 million or a 13% yield last quarter. The weighted average term for our bookings was 22 months compared to 27 months in the prior quarter. Of the $59 million in bookings, 26% related to Fraud Solutions, as our Falcon Fraud Manager maintains its dominant market position, 18% was related to Decision Management Tools and 15% related to Customer Management solutions. We had 14 booking deals in excess of $1 million, 3 of which exceeded $3 million.  Transactional and maintenance bookings were 33% of total this quarter versus 43% in the prior quarter. Professional service bookings were 46% this quarter versus 34%, and finally, license bookings were 21% this quarter versus 23% in the prior quarter.  Operating expenses totaled $118 million this quarter, down $1 million from quarter 4. As you can see on our Reg G schedule, non-GAAP operating margin, which is before amortization and stock-based compensation, was 34% for the first quarter compared to 29% in the prior quarter.  GAAP net income was $30 million and the effective tax rate was about 31% for the quarter, slightly higher than we expected due to the expiration of the R&D credit last month. As a result, we expect the effective tax rate to be around 31% to 32% for our fiscal 2012.  Free cash flow, which we defined as cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures and dividends, was $33 million or 19% of revenue compared to $25 million or 15% of revenue in the prior quarter.  Moving on quickly to the balance sheet, we had $232 million in cash and marketable securities. This is down about $10 million from last quarter due to share repurchases, offset by the strong cash flow from operations. Our total debt is at $512 million with the weighted average interest rate of 6.1%, and our cost of debt is fairly fixed at about $8 million per quarter. The ratio of our total net debt to adjusted EBITDA is 1.7x, below the covenant level of 3x, and our total fixed charge coverage ratio was at 4.2x, well above the covenant level of 2.5x. We had no borrowings under the line of credit facility, which we refinanced in September.  We repurchased 1.9 million shares in our first quarter at a total cost of $50.9 million or about $26.96 per share, and we have $134 million yet remaining under our current Board authorization. We continually evaluate the best way to deploy excess cash to maximize shareholder value and consider our share repurchase plan a very attractive use of our cash flow. We also regularly evaluate and consider opportunities to acquire relevant technologies and products that advance our strategy or strengthen our portfolio and competitive position.  Finally, I'd like to take a few moments to thank Mark on behalf of our shareholders and our employees for his leadership these past 5 years. He approached every day with amazing passion and conviction, and certainly has positioned us for continued success.  Thanks, Mark. I'll now turn the call back.
Mark N. Greene: Thank you, Mike. In this concluding section, I'd like to summarize the current state of our business and then turn the call over to Will for his comments.  As you look ahead to the balance of the fiscal year, we are reiterating the guidance that we gave the last quarter, but with increasing confidence that we can achieve the high end of that guidance range.  As a reminder, our guidance is as follows: Revenues between $640 million and $645 million or roughly 3% to 4% increase for the year compared with the $620 million of revenue generated last year; net income between $86 million and $89 million on a GAAP basis, up 19% to 24% from the $72 million of net income last year; and GAAP earnings per share between $2.45 and $2.55 based on 35 million shares outstanding, an increase of between $0.37 and 42% versus the prior year.  We're off to a strong start for this year, while we understand that there are macroeconomic uncertainties that may impact our business, especially in Europe, and while we're increasingly confident, we remain cautious in our guidance for the remainder of the year.  To sum up, we're pleased that this is also the quarter which demonstrate that our business model is driving solid earnings growth and margin expansion. We expect this to continue generating healthy earnings for our shareholders as we stay focused on driving top line revenue growth.  Now before I turn the call over to Will, I'd like to offer a few comments as I reflect in my 5-year tenure as FICO's CEO. I'm proud of what we've accomplished over that time, especially given the turbulence of financial markets. During my tenure, we streamlined and simplified the business, exiting non-core areas so that we could focus on leadership products in 4 industries: Banking, Insurance, retail and healthcare. We re-branded the company under the FICO logo, sharpening and raising our market profile and our reputation. We make good on our promise of connected decisions, delivering industry-leading solutions that truly allow clients to make every decision count. And finally, we instilled greater operational and fiscal discipline across the company. These efforts have borne fruit as reflected in the company's current good financial health. As a result, I'm very optimistic about FICO's prospects and the outlook for sustained growth under Will Lansing, who succeeds me as CEO starting tomorrow.  With that, happy turn the call over to Will for introductory comments.
William J. Lansing: Thanks, Mark. Good afternoon. I am delighted to become FICO's CEO and to get more involved with a company that I've known and respected for many years. I've served on the Board of Directors for the last 6 years, so I have some knowledge and perspective on FICO, including all the good work that's been done under Mark's leadership over the past 5 years. And so I start with a thank you to Mark for turning over to me a company in such fine shape and with such excellent future prospects.  I've also been around long enough to know that I have more to learn, and that's what I aim to do in the weeks ahead, learn as much as I can about our customers, about our partners and about our competitors. We've just reported an impressive start to the fiscal year as you heard earlier. The team feels good about our direction. We have some interesting growth opportunities before us, but those are tempered by a bit of uncertainty, for example, the debt crisis in Europe.  You're probably wondering what to expect with this transition. I don't think that you should expect large directional shifts. As a Board member, I have supported the strategy and approach that has taken us to where we are now. Given our current trajectory, I do not anticipate dramatic change. We have a strong confident team here at FICO, and I have worked with this executive team for years.  You'll see in my background that I have been involved in deals and M&A. Should you expect more of that at FICO in the future? Well, FICO has had some wonderful acquisitions in the past, for example, our acquisition of HNC. And we have, from time to time, made acquisitions of smaller companies where we thought it would be helpful. I believe that we can complement our organic growth with M&A growth, but I think we have a very high bar. Our own business is highly attractive and our prospects are bright, so any acquisition would have to be at least as attractive as investing in ourselves, and that is truly a high bar. As you know, we've had a successful value creating stock buyback program over the last few years, and I have fully supported that. Buying back FICO stock served us well, and our intention is to continue with the buyback program.  I'm about to dive into meetings with our employees, customers and partners all over the world, and certainly plan to meet with investors, too. I look forward to meeting with you. Thanks. Mark?
Mark N. Greene: Well, thank you for your kind comments, and well, now let me turn the call back over to Steve for our question-and-answer period.
Steven P. Weber: Thanks, Mark. This concludes our prepared remarks. And we're ready now to take your questions. Rob, please open the lines.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays Capital.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just wanted to congratulate Mark and William, I guess, on the transition going on, and looking forward to meeting you, William. One quick question on the 2 Fraud Management and license bookings, I guess, that you mentioned. Is there any way -- I know you mentioned there was very little incremental cost, but is there any way to quantify that in terms of what EPS benefit that had in the quarter? If basically those were not signed, what the number might have looked like?
Mark N. Greene: So, Manav, we aren't in the practice of or would I be in the practice of pulling out any specific transaction or sets of transactions to do an EPS calculation. I think looking at the face of the income statement and seeing the growth in our license revenue can give you an indication of how important those deals were to us. But we don't do any what if calculations on specific transactions.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, fair enough. And then related to that, I think you had mentioned that you would expect license revenue as a percentage of total revenue creep up. So I just want to clarify, so that was about 16%, I think, of revenues this quarter, so you expect that 16% number to either stay there or continue to rise for the rest of the 3 quarters?
Mark N. Greene: No, what I meant to say is I expect for the full year the percentage of revenue coming from license sales will be larger than it was last year. It won't creep up from the 16%.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Got it. So it was on a yearly basis?
Michael J. Pung: On a yearly basis, yes.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, fair enough. And then if I could ask just on the Scores business, Mark you mentioned that all forms, the acquisition, Origination and account management were up. I was just hoping if you could maybe give a little more sort of macro color on those 3 different things and how you might see that trending given the economic environment you're in right now?
Michael J. Pung: Happy to do so, Manav. What we are seeing -- what I've been hoping to see for several quarters, which is the monkey flowing through the snake as it were. So we continue to see increased activity [indiscernible] end of the life cycle and applications, that's the of 14% number that I mentioned, but now we're also seeing an uptake in subsequent originations in account management, so that's a good thing. I would only temper that by saying one quarter does not sit in our trend line make yet, so let's see several more quarters of that before we really feel good about this growing business. But it is nice to finally see growth occurring across the spectrum here. We've not seen that since the downturn. So I'm cautiously optimistic that we've turned the corner, we see tentative signs of recovery in the U.S. but we want to see another quarter or 2 of that kind of behavior before we conclude that we've actually really turned the corner.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Got it. And one final question on R&D, the $13 million, I mean, any color on what we should expect that number trending for the rest of the quarters? I mean it seems like for the last 5 quarters, you guys have cut that number lower and lower, and maybe if you can comment on why it just keeps going down as opposed to maybe throwing that into developing new stuff.
Mark N. Greene: Sure, Manav. So R&D this quarter was roughly the same as it was in our fourth quarter, which has been our run rate. Last quarter, I think I gave guidance that I was expecting the R&D expense to be somewhere around 9% to 10% of total revenue, and that's still where I expect it to be by the end of the year. And so I wouldn't expect the trend to drift downward from where we are. We're at a spend level now that we're very comfortable with in terms of investment against the roadmap we're operating under.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carter Malloy from Stephens Inc.
Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Will and Mark, congratulations to both you guys, and the rest of the team there as well for a great quarter and what appears to be a great trajectory coming into the year here. I do want to go back to the questions on Fraud Management there and the license revenues. You said license was 16% this quarter versus 9% year-over-year. So we're looking at an incremental $15 million in license revenue give or take. Should I assume that most license revenues are concentrated within Fraud, is that one way to look at it without having to have -- have you call it out specifically?
Mark N. Greene: No, the increment is within Fraud, but most of the other license revenue is really derived from our Blaze or our Tools products and a couple of other parts of the applications. But the increment this quarter is the Fraud products that I described.
Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Got it. Got it. So if we back that up or back that out of our models, we're sort of looking at returning to a more normalized call it $155 million, maybe $160 million run rate for the rest of the year, that's how you build up the guidance?
Michael J. Pung: Well, we built up the guidance a little bit differently, but let me get to that in a second. We wouldn't advise you to back out anything in terms of looking at our revenue. In fact, every quarter, we have license revenue, whether it be perpetual or term, that come and go depending upon the timing of a deal. It just so happens we had 2 very large ones this quarter, and in future quarters I expect us to have other license deals that will flow in and out as the timing occurs. So I don't think it's safe just to back those out and say that's a new run rate. If you follow the math around the guidance that we gave you for revenue, at the top end, $645 million of revenue minus what we did in the first quarter would suggest something around $158 million of revenue going forward for the rest of the year. And that would be a way for you to back into how we constructed our guidance.
Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Got you. But effectively, if we look at $158 million, if you have other Falcon-type deals that are this big, then we can have another quarter or 2 throughout the year that looks something like this, where we are surprised to the upside by a whale contract that comes through.
Mark N. Greene: Well, there's always the possibility of a whale contract coming through and we've not built any of that into our guidance. We've not made an assumption, in other words, that there would be another whale. But certainly, as you saw last quarter in our bookings, we have 3 very large booking deals. This quarter we had 2 very large term license revenue deals, and it is possible that the from time to time we'll see larger transactions, though the ones we saw this year are much larger than normal. They also can come, by the way, Carter, in areas outside of Falcon, for example, Blaze.
Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay. Okay, very helpful there. And then also, your EPS guidance for the year, which appears equally, if not more so, conservative, I'm assuming though in your end there is no more buyback built into your guidance, is that a safe assumption?
Mark N. Greene: We do have a little bit of guidance built into our plan. And as you remember, it's not much. But as you remember, we took a large amount of shares in the month of October when we were trading in the low 20s and our stock price has drifted upwards and the pace by which we've been buying shares back was changed based upon the way the market has been on our stock recently.
Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Sure, we noticed that. It's great. Then lastly on CapEx, decent-sized tick-up this quarter, is that a fair run rate or is there some one-time stuff in there?
Mark N. Greene: No. Last quarter, I'd mentioned that the fourth quarter CapEx was a little light as we've been building out a data center, and that some of the spend we thought would come in, in the fourth quarter, actually hit in our first quarter. We're fundamentally done with equipping the data center, and so it's not a run rate, it's a little bit of spillover, I'll call it, from the fourth quarter. I would say our CapEx is probably trending more to the $20 million range as a result of that rather than the $16 million to $18 million that we've historically done.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions in the queue.

===== 2011 Q4  (2011-11-02 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Steve Weber - Head IR Mark N. Greene - Chief Executive Officer and Director Michael J. Pung - Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, Senior Vice President and Vice President of Finance & Investor Relations
Analysts: Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division Nandan Amladi - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Rob, and I will your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the FICO Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Steve Weber, you may begin your call.
Steve Weber: Thank you, Rob. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining FICO's fourth quarter earnings call. I'm Steve Weber, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by CEO, Mark Greene; and CFO, Mike Pung. You'll find on the Investor Relations portion of the FICO website a copy of today's news release, our Regulation G Disclosure schedule and our financial highlights. While our press release describes financial results compared to the prior year, today, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular, in the Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. In order to provide additional information to investors, we will use certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, entitled Regulation G Disclosure, is available on the Investor page of our website under the Presentations tab. A replay of this webcast will be available through December 2, 2011. Now I'll turn the call over to Mark Greene.
Mark N. Greene: Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon. We'll proceed as usual today in 3 parts. First, I'll summarize the quarterly results and discuss the state of our business as we ended our fiscal year in September. Mike Pung will then provide financial details and discuss the effects of the structural changes we made over the past year. Finally, I'll discuss our business outlook and financial guidance for the new fiscal year before we take your questions. I'm pleased to report that we finished fiscal 2011 on a solid note, meeting the metrics we guided to. This quarter, we delivered $25 million of net income or $0.64 per share on $160 million of revenue. We delivered $106 million of bookings, the largest total in 5 years. For the full year, we delivered non-GAAP net income of $80 million on revenues of $620 million and bookings of $298 million, while producing free cash flows of $119 million. Mike will dive into these numbers in a few moments, but I'd like to emphasize that we're very much on the path that we laid out when we announced our restructuring back in February. We've made it a priority to allocate resources towards product innovation, client service and revenue-producing activity. And we're now seeing the fruits of those efforts. Let me break out our quarterly performance according to the 3 segments of our Decision Management portfolio. First, the Decision Management Application segment consists of business software used by clients to better understand and predict consumer behavior in order to make smarter decisions over a customer life cycle. Revenue from these applications was solid this quarter, up both sequentially and year-over-year, as we saw good results throughout the portfolio. Our strongest performers continue to be in the Fraud Management business, where we saw a year-over-year revenue growth of 14% in banking fraud management and 36% in Insurance Fraud Management. In banking fraud, full year revenue were up nearly 16% as we continue to migrate customers to the latest version of our Falcon Fraud Manager. And on the insurance side, we've now signed 8 customers, including 1 large multimillion dollar insurance fraud manager customer, through our previously-announced partnership with Emdeon. Elsewhere in applications, our Marketing solutions business continues to grow. This quarter, we signed more than $40 million in bookings for our Retail Action Manager product as we added a third client and sold additional software and services to an existing client. In addition, we've seen demand for our Marketing solutions outside of the retail industry, particularly in the banking sector where demand is increasing for sophisticated precision marketing capabilities for retail banks. Our second reporting segment is our Scores business, which consists of predictive analytics used to assess risk. Overall, Scores revenue was up 8% from the prior quarter and also up 8% from the prior year. We track 2 subsegments here: business-to-business, which are scores sold to financial institutions, and business-to-consumer, which are scores sold directly to consumers at myFICO.com, as well as scores sold indirectly to consumers through our bureau partners. The B2B Scores subsegment was particularly strong, up 11% from last quarter and also up 11% from the same quarter in the prior year. In fact, revenues for the quarter were higher than any of the previous 5 quarters. We continue to invest in this B2B Scores business and are beginning to see the results in both our core business, as well as some of our new innovations that will provide new revenue streams. Highlights for the quarter include the following. Scores sold for marketing purposes to solicit new customers were up 26% over the year -- year-over-year, with the highest growth in our PreScore Service, which are scores that we sell directly to customers for marketing. Market adoption of our latest Score, FICO 8, continues to grow with over 7,000 lenders now using FICO 8 within their risk management practices. That's up from 6,000 reported last quarter. We announced during the quarter that we have predictive analytics engagements now with 4 of the country's top 10 mortgage servicers to identify borrowers at the greatest risk of strategic default. We estimate that while still at an early stage, the strategic default problem will exceed $20 billion annually, and we further estimate that the collective benefit of our solution for the 4 services that we're working with could reach $2 billion in the first year. We announced a new partnership with CoreLogic to develop an enhanced FICO Mortgage Score solution for the U.S. mortgage industry, leveraging CoreLogic's data assets with our own analytic expertise to provide lenders increased visibility into borrower credit behavior and future credit risks. In a different part of our Scores business, the FICO Medication Adherence Score launched previously represents an advance in our application of predictive analytics to solve healthcare problems. Non-adherence to medication accounts for nearly $300 billion in annual healthcare expenditures in the U.S. and can have serious consequences for patient health. Our clients are seeking new ways to address such problems, and we believe that FICO can provide valuable solutions here. Finally, we announced an agreement with Equifax to develop new analytics for the U.K. market. These scores will assess the capacity of consumers to handle additional credit and show how individuals’ risk would change under different macroeconomic conditions. These offerings are an extension of the partnership we previously announced with Equifax in May. In the consumer or B2C segment of our Scores business, we saw a small revenue decline in the fourth quarter of 3% versus the prior quarter. I'm pleased to announce the appointment of Amber Minson to lead our consumer scores business. Amber has a strong track record of delivering results in consumer online businesses, and I'm confident in her ability to grow this unit. Our third and final business segment is Decision Management Tools, which consists of tools management, modeling and optimization products embedded within our applications and also sold standalone to clients who wish to build their own applications. Revenue in this Tools segment was up 6% from last quarter and up 3% from the prior year. Because these products are generally sold as licenses, there tends to be more fluctuation in revenue trends. So to summarize our fourth quarter results, we're pleased with how we ended the fiscal year. We met our guidance, and the reengineering efforts we implemented earlier in the year have positioned us well to deliver sustainable value to our shareholders as we now move into fiscal 2012. Let me pass the call now to Mike Pung for further financial details.
Michael J. Pung: Thanks, Mark. We had a solid fourth quarter and delivered against both our revenue and net income guidance for fiscal 2011. We also made significant financial structural improvements during this past year. Today, I will summarize how we improved our operating performance and strengthened our balance sheet and explain why we're confident in our position as we enter fiscal 2012. First, our operating leverage increased 600 basis points since the beginning of the year, driven by modest top line growth and the restructuring efforts announced earlier in the year. Non-GAAP operating margins were 26% for the full fiscal 2011 compared to 24% last year, and we anticipate our margin in fiscal 2012 to approximate our quarter 4 exit rate. Second, we generated $119 million of free cash flow during the year, an increase of 40% from last year. We believe share repurchases are a responsible use of our cash. And this year, we repurchased 3.6 million shares of our stock, reducing our share count by 9% from last year. All the while, we strengthened our balance sheet. We have $242 million of cash at the end of the year. We refinanced our revolving line of credit, and our leverage is 1.8x, also a significant improvement from last year. We repurchased an additional 1.4 million shares of our stock in the month of October, further reducing our share count to about 35.6 million shares outstanding. And today, our board authorized a new repurchase plan for another $150 million. Finally, we are providing 2012 guidance at a level that reflects a confident yet cautious view of our business in light of ongoing economic uncertainty in the world markets. Now I'll discuss the quarterly results in more detail. Revenue for the quarter was $160 million, a $10 million increase over the prior quarter and a $5 million increase over the prior year. The increase was seen throughout all our segments. Applications revenue was $97 million, up 6% over the prior quarter and 1% over the prior year. Scores revenue was $45 million, up 8% over the prior quarter and 8% over the prior year. In Tools, revenue was up $18 million -- was $18 million, up 6% over the prior quarter and 3% over the prior year. By region, this quarter, 75% of total revenue was derived from the Americas region, the same as last quarter. Our EMEA region generated 18% in both this quarter and in the prior. And the remaining 7% was from Asia-Pacific. By type of revenue, recurring revenue derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter represented 72% of total revenues versus 74% in the prior quarter. Consulting and implementation revenues were 20% of total revenues, same as last quarter. And license revenues were 8% of total revenue compared to 6% in the prior quarter. We expect license revenues as a percent of total revenue to increase in our first quarter next year. In terms of bookings, we generated $15 million of current period revenue on bookings of $106 million, a 14% yield. This compares with $12 million of revenue on bookings of $50 million, a 24% yield last quarter. The weighted average term of our bookings was 27 months this quarter compared to 19 months in the prior quarter. Of the $106 million in bookings, 44% related to Marketing solutions, 14% related to Originations products and 13% related to our Tools business. We had 14 booking deals in excess of $1 million, 3 of which exceeded $3 million. Transactional and maintenance bookings were 40% of total bookings this quarter versus 34% in the prior quarter. Professional service bookings were 36% this quarter versus 46% in the prior quarter. And finally, license bookings were 24% this quarter versus 20% in the prior quarter. Operating expenses totaled $119 million this quarter, up $6 million from the prior quarter. The increase was related to several year-end expenses, including incentives, as well as expenses associated with higher revenue. As you can see from our Reg G schedule, non-GAAP operating margin before amortization and stock-based compensation was 29% for the fourth quarter compared to 28% in the prior quarter. GAAP net income was $25 million, and the effective tax rate was about 26% for the quarter. For the full fiscal year, our GAAP net income was $72 million, while our non-GAAP net income adjusted for the restructuring charges taken earlier this year was $80 million. We expect the effective tax rate to be about 30% in fiscal 2012. Free cash flow, we define free cash flow as cash flow from operations less CapEx and dividends paid. Free cash flow for the quarter was $25 million or 15% of revenue, compared to $41 million or 27% of revenue in the prior quarter. For the full year, free cash flow was $119 million versus $85 million last year. Moving to the balance sheet, we have $242 million of cash and marketable securities, down about $17 million from last quarter, mainly due to the share repurchase program. Our total debt is at $512 million, with a weighted average interest rate of 6.1%, and the cost of our debt is a fairly fixed at $8 million per quarter. The ratio of our total net debt to adjusted EBITDA is 1.8x, well below the covenant level of 3x. And our total fixed charge coverage ratio is at 3.8x, well above the covenant level of 2.5x. We had no borrowings under our line of credit facility, which we financed -- refinanced in September. We repurchased 1.7 million shares in the fourth quarter at a total cost of $43.7 million or about $25.16 per share. In addition, we purchased another $1.4 million in the month of October. We had utilized the bulk of the board's share repurchase authorization. So today, we are announcing that the board replaced that authorization with a new plan to purchase up to $150 million of additional stock. We continually evaluate the best way to deploy excess cash to maximize shareholder value and consider our share repurchase plan a very attractive use of our cash flow. We also, of course, regularly evaluate and consider opportunities to acquire relevant technologies and products that advance our strategy or strengthen our portfolio and competitive position. I'll now turn the call back to Mark.
Mark N. Greene: In this concluding section, I'll discuss our prospects and guidance for fiscal 2012. In our Applications and Tools businesses, we continue to see signs of improved spending on technology, especially this class of software, along with a strong pipeline of opportunities worldwide. Concerning prospects for our Scores business, I’ve said before that our B2B Scores business is closely tied to the U.S. economic growth outlook. While we had very good volumes and revenues in the fourth quarter, we're not yet ready to call this a trend. With the current high unemployment rate and sluggishness in the housing market, we remain cautious about our B2B Scores outlook until we can see sustained economic growth in the United States. For our B2C business, Scores revenue growth will continue to be tied to the success of our marketing efforts through myFICO.com, and we expect that our new leadership in that part of the business will have favorable impact in the months ahead. Now to guidance for FY '12. We expect revenues between $640 million and $645 million or roughly a 3% to 4% increase for the year, compared with the $620 million of revenue generated in fiscal 2011. We expect net income between $86 million and $89 million on a GAAP basis or up 19% to 24% from the $72 million of net income generated last year. This translates to GAAP earnings per share of between $2.45 and $2.55 based on 35 million shares outstanding or an increase between 37% and 42% versus the prior year. In summary, we are pleased with the results of this quarter and the fiscal year. We're now realizing the benefits of our restructuring efforts in the form of earnings growth and margin expansion. Our business model now deliveries strong operating leverage, and we expect to continue generating healthy earnings for our shareholders as we follow through and deliver more top line revenue growth. As we move into the new fiscal year, we continue to pursue larger, more complex solution sales. Because of their size and complexity, these deals are difficult to time, so we expect to see more revenue volatility, particularly in our license revenues. At the same time, we believe these deals bring exceptional value to our clients and shareholders and ensure long-term growth and financial sustainability. In closing, I'd like to share with you some of what I'm seeing this week at our FICO World Conference, our global customer event taking place this week in New York. Over 700 attendees, mostly in the banking and insurance industries, senior executives, are here seeking game-changing strategies and solutions for profitable growth. These executives face severe stresses in their businesses from economic, regulatory and political stress in Europe and the United States to the very real stress of hyper growth and competition in markets such as China, Brazil and Russia. Yet amid those conditions, they've made time to come talk to FICO. Why? For the same reason I believe we're able to report strong financial results here today. The value of FICO solutions is increasingly apparent in the marketplace. And thanks to the structural improvements we've made to our business over the past years, we're well positioned to deliver that strong value to our shareholders as well. With that, I'll turn the call back to Steve for question-and-answer. Steve?
Steve Weber: Thanks, Mark. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we're now ready to take your questions. Rob, please open the line.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Thomas Ernst from Deutsche Bank.
Nandan Amladi - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: This is Nandan Amladi on behalf of Tom. Just a couple of questions. On the bookings front, clearly you had a decent quarter seasonally up, but the year-on-year basis, a fairly modest increase. But the number of large deals, both the $3 million and greater and $1 million greater, dropped. So how much of this was kind of macro related versus anything that's company specific?
Michael J. Pung: Nandan, it's Mike here. I wouldn't say any of them are really macro conditions. We just frankly had several very, very large deals this quarter that drove a lot of the bookings growth that you see in the numbers. And we also had a lot of exceptionally midsized deals, if you will. And so the overall volume of deals is roughly the same. The big whales were really more limited to several that are very large in size.
Nandan Amladi - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And how about your efforts to expand geographically? Clearly, there's economic opportunity in the BRIC countries, and I know you had spent some resources expanding to China, Russia, Brazil. How are those efforts going?
Mark N. Greene: Nandan, it's Mark. Well, we actually had 18% growth in our Asia business, so they had a record quarter last quarter, and China's an important part of that growth story. So I think, particularly, our China expansion is going well. We are in the early stages of a similar expansion in Russia, where I expect to be able to report similar progress in the near future.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays Capital.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: On the Scores front, the growth, after 5 negative quarters, finally growth. I just wanted to dig a little bit more in terms of -- I know you guys said it's a little too early, if you could just make a call. But you provided the PreScore growth. Can you give a little color on the Originations Score growth? And I guess previously you talked about the lag of 6 to 8 months before you see the PreScores convert. What's your thought process there from what you see today?
Mark N. Greene: Manav, it's Mark. I think we like what we're still seeing and especially at the front end of the life cycle. So you're correct that the PreScore or what we sometimes call acquisition Scores continues to have healthy growth there. We saw 18% growth in that part of the business. Originations is also growing, and that's the next phase, although not as strongly. It was a 2% growth. We have not yet seen that translate on a year-over-year basis into growth on account management. Although in the last couple of quarters, account management, which is the next phase of the life cycle, has begun to come up as well, so there's some early evidence that if you will that pig is moving through the python in the fashion that we hope to see it. But there remains quite a bit of livelihood and activity at the front end of the life cycle, which is encouraging. And if that's sustained, I'm feeling increasingly confident about what will happen later in the life cycle. The caveat in my remarks about fiscal '12 is that when I look out at the macro environment, I still see [indiscernible] around housing and unemployment. So while our Scoring business is holding up well and showing signs of life, it will require a sustained economic recovery that we don't quite yet see before I will feel more bullish about the prospects for B2B Scores.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Got it. So I guess, by the commentary then, is it right to assume that the 3% to 4% growth that you're projecting on the top line is -- seems to be, going to be driven more by the Applications and Tools business?
Mark N. Greene: That's correct. We've taken what I hope will prove to be a conservative view that our Scores business will be essentially flat overall for the coming year. As I say, I hope that's the floor on what actually happens, and I hope I can report upside progress against that. But you're exactly right. The 3% to 4% growth that we're projecting is substantially driven from Apps and Tools.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Got it. And then lastly, in terms of -- thank you for the guidance for 2012, the clarity. On the free cash flow front though, I mean, should we still assume it's the $25 million a quarter run rate? Or do you guys have the projections in mind?
Michael J. Pung: So I would say we're expecting free cash flow to grow somewhere between 5% to 10% next year. First quarter, we have some CapEx expenditures that I was expecting to have in the fourth quarter that will probably hit in the first quarter for a data center rebuild. So overall, that puts free cash flow for the year, next year to be somewhere around $125 million to $130 million range [indiscernible] about those numbers.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And the total CapEx embedded in that?
Michael J. Pung: Well, total CapEx embedded for next year, roughly $15 million to $17 million.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Carter Malloy from Stephens Inc.
Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Congrats on the bottom line controls and the good outlook for next year. My questions will center around that. First is, in light of the big EPS guidance for '12, what's your approach towards the buyback right now? Are you guys going at it opportunistically or very methodically? Because it sounded like there was not much of that built into your guidance. I just want to make sure that's correct.
Michael J. Pung: Yes, you are correct. We were quite aggressive in the month of October. Our stock price took a dip, and we went in and picked up 1.4 million shares as I made in my comment. So we started the year quite aggressive. We're just over 35.5 million shares as we sit today, and we've modeled in at least for now some modest buyback over the remaining course of the quarter. And that's why we've guided shares at roughly 35 million. We'll continue to buy opportunistically as the year goes on, but we started out, I would say, with a bang.
Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then on the R&D line, last quarter, we were talking about that coming down to 10% or being around 10% long term. This quarter we did way under that. Guidance implies you're keeping a cap on the OpEx going forward. So how should we think about modeling that line? And also how should we think about any potential business impacts or where you're actually making those cuts in R&D?
Michael J. Pung: Well, we're not making any further cuts in R&D. I mean, we have basically brought our R&D spend down to roughly 8% in the fourth quarter. And for the year, we were somewhere around 9% to 10%. And then I think it's pretty safe to say on a go-forward basis that 9% to 10% is where we're continuing to run the R&D line. We're not cutting back on any of our investment. In fact, we think we're investing in all the right areas across the portfolio to drive our growth for next year, but I would suggest you model it out around 9% to 10%.
Mark N. Greene: Carter, it's Mark. One additional comment I'd offer is we're far enough into the buildout of our next-generation applications that we’re in some sense sort of over a hump that we climbed over in the past year. And so I agree with Mike's comment that 9% or 10% is probably the right number, but you'd be surprised how much we can get done with that level of spend given the infrastructure we've already poured and the retooling of most of our major applications that’s already taken place.
Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Sure. That's very helpful. Then lastly, can you just talk about your conversations recently with clients and potential clients? Everyone is looking over their shoulders at volatile markets and volatile CapEx spend. Are you seeing any lengthening of deal timelines? Or what are the conversations like there?
Mark N. Greene: We haven't yet seen lengthening of deal times. I would say that in the last 30, 45 days, we've seen, especially in Europe, increased skittishness from consumers. No deals have been pulled. All deals continue to progress through the pipeline. But as we get down to the short straws of sort of deal signing and so on, they're checking their checkbook twice. They're running through extra review processes, or they may be poised to do so. And so we stay in close contact, especially in certain European countries where we have big ambitions over the next couple of months because the nervousness in Europe is growing, and that could be a risk factor to worry about on a go-forward basis here. The risk profile here in the states is also elevated, but not distinctly more so than it's been earlier this year. It remains a nervous environment, but I wouldn't say it's more so than it was 2 or 3 quarters ago. Europe is a different story. Europe's become more nervous.
Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay. And so on Europe, how much of your revenues is EU specifically? And I assume that most of that's with the big banks, so can you talk about the recurring nature of some of that revenue and how much of it is potentially affected by a slowdown, especially with those banks?
Michael J. Pung: Yes, so we roughly have about 28% to 30% of our revenue coming out of the EMEA region, most of it coming out of Western Europe. We have a fair amount of recurring revenue that's been driven from Falcon and TRIAD installations that have been in our baseline business for many years. I would say where probably the biggest risk is, is signing new deals, license deals. In our view, the baseline seems pretty solid, but the timing of new deals in particular is probably less clear than it was 3 months ago.
Mark N. Greene: And I think Mike's right. It's timing. It's when, not if, in our discussions with those customers. They're very committed to going forward with the projects, some of them quite substantial that we've been tracking for some months. But will it close in December or January or March? There's a little bit of wait-and-see taking place, but nobody has suggested to us that they're taking deals off the table.
Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division: And if those deals get pushed by a couple of quarters, are we talking about impacts to the top line? I'm just trying to gauge the variable revenue there, so are we talking about impacts to the top line in your European business of $1 million or $2 million or $10 million?
Michael J. Pung: So net new revenue in any particular quarter for our EMEA region can run anywhere $5 million to $8 million, plus or minus. So that's the sort of variability we would be talking about, some percentage of that number.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters.
Steve Weber: Thank you, Rob. As a reminder, we'll be holding an Investor Day tomorrow in conjunction with our FICO World Conference. That event will also be webcast, and the Investor page on our website has more information on that. Thank you all for joining today's call.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

A replay of this webcast will be available through September 3, 2011. Now I'll turn the call over to Mark Greene.
Mark Greene: Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon. We'll proceed today as usual in 3 parts. First, I'll summarize the quarter results and assess our business in light of current market conditions. Mike Pung will then provide further financial details. Finally, I'll discuss our business outlook for the balance of fiscal 2011 before we take your questions. For the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we had mixed results, with revenue down when compared to the prior year and prior quarter, but net income up significantly compared to the same periods. Third quarter revenue was $151 million, down $2 million over the prior quarter and down $5 million year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share in the quarter were $0.58, up 49% from last quarter and up 41% year-over-year. Bookings were $50 million compared to $58 million last quarter and $64 million in the third quarter of 2010. Year-to-date, revenue and bookings have grown 2% and 8%, respectively, from the prior year. Our transactional and service revenues remained strong during the quarter. However, our license revenue declined by about $5 million versus the prior quarter. This is always disappointing as we had several large deals in the pipeline that we expected to sign by the end of the quarter that did not.  I've noted in prior calls that we expect some variation in framing around revenues associated with large license deals. And we believe the lower license revenue this quarter is an example of that. The deals that failed to close in time were not losses, but pushed into the current quarter, and we still expect them to come good. On the expense side, this quarter, we realized the full benefit of the restructuring that we did last quarter. Our operating expenses are down $9 million from last quarter and down $11 million from the prior year. Despite the decline in license revenue, our adjusted operating margin grew to 28% this quarter compared to 24% last year. Let me now break down the performance into the 3 segments of our Decision Management portfolio. Beginning first with the Decision Management Applications segment, which consists of business software used by clients to better understand and predict consumer behavior to help them make smarter decisions over customer life cycles. Revenue from these applications was $92 million, down 4% sequentially due to a drop in license sales and up 1% versus the same period last year. Within this Applications segment, we had another solid quarter in our Fraud Management business, which consists of Insurance Fraud Manager and Falcon Fraud Manager for banking. Fraud Management bookings were nearly $18 million for the quarter, up 24% from the previous quarter and up 52% from the previous year, while revenues grew 2% and 9% on a sequential and year-over-year basis. We remain very pleased with the performance of our strong Fraud Management franchise.  Turning next to our Scores segment, which consists of predictive analytics to use risk -- to assess risk. Overall Scores revenue was $42 million, up 2% from the prior quarter. We track 2 subsegments here: B2B, which are scores sold to financial institutions; and B2C, which are scores sold directly to consumers at myFICO.com, as well as scores sold indirectly to consumers through bureau partners. The first of these, the B2B Scores segment, continues to track with the economy, as B2B Scores revenue were up slightly from last quarter, although down 10% from the same period last year due primarily to a true-up in royalty fees last year. We continue to focus on maintaining our market leadership in this area, and we look for opportunities to provide new revenue streams.  Highlights from the quarter include that the marketed option of our latest score, which is FICO 8, continues to grow with approximately 6,000 lenders now using FICO 8 in their risk management practices. That's up from about 4,000 reported last quarter.  Secondly, we launched a new strategic default analytic solution for the mortgage industry with validations underway with top clients and a strong and growing pipeline. Third, we saw large client marketing acquisition activities continue to grow with a 17% quarterly increase year-over-year.  And fourth, we launched a new FICO Medication Adherence Score, which uses predictive analytics to forecast an individual's likelihood of taking his or her prescription medication as directed. This FICO Medication Adherence Score is HIPAA-compliant and it will help improve prescription adherence, boosting therapy effectiveness and reducing healthcare costs. We're now in active discussions about this offering with the 40 top health care companies and 10 top pharmaceutical companies that are already our clients. And we're confident that this innovative product will make a big impact in the healthcare marketplace. Now concerning the regulatory front, new regulations took effect last month as part of the Dodd-Frank Act, including establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. We support the CFPB in its efforts to promote transparency and simplicity in consumer lending. The regulations that went into effect in July changed the risk-based pricing notices and adverse action notices that creditors must send to consumers. We anticipate that in more than 90% of cases, these notices will now include a FICO score, hoping to strengthen awareness of FICO scores among consumers.  I previously mentioned that in anticipation of these new regulations, we launched scoreinfo.org, which is an educational website to provide consumers with comprehensive credit education and information about these new risk-based pricing rules and other federally mandated credit disclosure notices. This free, noncommercial website helps consumers understand how FICO scores are calculated and used and what can be done to improve credit standing. It's also consistent with our long-standing belief that better consumers understand credit score and credit health, the more likely they'll be to prefer the FICO score, or as we refer to it, the score that matters. These new regulations are not expected to have a material effect on FICO's revenues. The scores being disclosed already will have been purchased by lenders through Equifax, Experian or TransUnion. So we expect neither a gain nor a loss in revenue as a result of these score disclosures. We do, however, anticipate that increased awareness of FICO scores will motivate more consumers to visit myfico.com for products and information. In this B2C or consumer segment of our Scores business, we saw another revenue increase in the third quarter for direct sales to consumers through myfico.com. In the quarter, revenues grew 6% sequentially. That increase was partially offset by a decline in revenue generated from our bureau channel partners selling scores to consumers indirectly.  The third and final segment of our Decision Management portfolio is Tools, which consists of rules management, modeling and optimization products embedded within our applications and also sold standalone to clients who build their own applications. Revenue in this Tools segment was $17 million during the quarter, down 3% from the prior year but up 6% from last quarter and up 3% year-to-date. Because these tool offerings are generally sold with licenses, there tends to be more volatility in their revenue trends. So to summarize our third quarter results, license revenue was disappointing due to the timing of completing several large deals, but we saw improved earnings performance as a result of the restructuring we announced last quarter. With our new leveraged model, we achieved significant expansion in margins this quarter. And as we sign the larger deals we have in our pipeline, we're confident that we can deliver both top and bottom line growth.  Let me now pass the call to Mike Pung for further financial details.
Michael Pung: Thanks, Mark. I want to emphasize 3 points in my prepared comments today. First, revenue growth remains a high priority for the organization. And despite this quarter's soft license revenue results, we are confident that we're investing in the right areas to drive growth over the long term. Second, we delivered significant improvement in operating leverage and free cash flow during the quarter and will continue to manage our expenses wisely. Finally, we'll be reaffirming our guidance for the current fiscal year. Mark has discussed our revenue results by segment, so I'll provide some additional comments as it relates to specific aspects of our business. Revenue for the quarter was $151 million. By region, this quarter, 75% of total revenue was derived from the Americas region versus 73% in the prior quarter. Our EMEA region generated 18% of our revenue compared to 20% in the prior quarter and the remaining 7% was from Asia-Pacific, both this quarter and prior. Recurring revenue, derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter, represented 74% of total revenues versus 73% in the prior quarter. Consulting and implementation revenues were 20% of total versus 18% in the prior quarter, and license revenues were 6% of total revenue versus 9% in the prior quarter. We expect license revenues as a percent of total revenue to increase in the fourth quarter.  Turning to bookings, we generated $12 million of current period revenue on bookings of $50 million or a 24% yield. This compares with $17 million of revenue on bookings of $58 million, a 29% yield in the prior quarter. The weighted average term for our bookings was 19 months, both this quarter and last.  Of the $50 million in bookings, 36% related to our Fraud Management products, 20% related to Tools, 11% to collections and recovery products. We had 10 bookings in excess of $1 million, one of which exceeded $3 million. Transactional and maintenance bookings were 34% of total bookings this quarter versus 29% in the prior quarter. Professional services bookings were 46% this quarter versus 48% in the prior quarter. And finally, license bookings were 19% this quarter versus 23% in the prior quarter. Turning to operating expenses. Excluding the restructuring charge from last quarter, this quarter life [ph] the operating expenses were $113 million, down about $9 million from the prior quarter. The decline was primarily related to the savings from the cost restructuring we announced and the timing of certain expenses tied to lower revenue. We expect that the current quarter represents the full benefit of the restructuring and that expenses will likely trend up slightly as revenue grows. As you can see on our Reg G schedule, non-GAAP operating margin before amortization, stock-based comp and restructuring was 28% for the third quarter compared to 24% in the prior quarter. GAAP net income was $23 million and the effective tax rate was about 27% for the quarter, which included a favorable tax settlement. We expect effective tax rate to be about 30% in quarter 4. On to free cash flow. We define free cash flow as cash from operations less CapEx and dividends paid. The free cash flow for the quarter was $41 million or 27% of revenue compared to $22 million or 14% of revenue in the prior quarter. Year-to-date, our free cash flow is $94 million compared to $69 million over the same period last year.  Moving on to the balance sheet. We still have $259 million in cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet, basically flat from last quarter as our operating cash flow offset the share repurchases. Our total debt stands at $504 million, with a weighted average interest rate of 6.1%, and our total cost of debt is about $8 million per quarter. The ratio of our total net debt to adjusted EBITDA is 1.8x, well below the covenant level of 3x, and our total fixed charge coverage ratio is 3.6x, well above the covenant level of 2.5x. We have no borrowings under our line of credit facility and still anticipate that we will refinance it before it matures in late October.  During the quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares at a total cost of $35.2 million or about $28.84 per share and still have $122 million remaining under our current board authorization. We continually evaluate the best way to deploy excess cash to maximize shareholder value and consider our share repurchase plan a very attractive use of our cash flow. We also regularly evaluate and consider opportunities to acquire relevant technologies or products that advance our strategy and strengthen our portfolio and competitive position. With that, I'll turn it now back to Mark.
Mark Greene: Thanks, Mike. In this concluding section, I'll discuss our prospects and outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2011. In our Application and Tool businesses, we continue to see gradual signs of improved spending on technology, with the budget easing and investments being made across the industries we serve. Last quarter, was saw strength in both EMEA and Asia-Pacific. And going forward, we see a healthy pipeline of opportunities across all of our geographies.  Concerning prospects for our Scores business, we believe that the beginnings of a credit turnaround are underway, with consumers spending a bit more and banks generally more willing to extend additional credit, which should be good for economic growth. That's tempered, however, by uncertainty in Washington, sluggishness in the housing market and still high unemployment numbers. The net of these offsetting trends is, as we've consistently said, that we expect our total B2B Scores revenues to grow over time at roughly the rate of GDP growth.  For our B2C business, revenue growth will be largely tied to our success in marketing efforts through myFICO.com.  Now to guidance for the remainder of FY '11. As Mike indicated, we're reaffirming our previous guidance for the fiscal year as we move towards year end.  That guidance is as follows: Revenue of between $620 million and $625 million. We continue to believe that we have the pipeline to deliver total revenue in this range, and we have plans in place to close the deals needed to achieve these numbers; net income of between $68 million and $72 million on a GAAP basis, with increased confidence in hitting the top end of net income as our expense management efforts bear fruit; non-GAAP net income of between $77 million and $81 million excluding restructuring charges; GAAP earnings per share between $1.71 and $1.81 and non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.93 and $2.03 excluding restructuring charges. In our call next quarter, we will be issuing guidance for fiscal 2012, which starts in October.  In closing, while we had mixed results this quarter, particularly on the top line, we're now realizing the benefits of our restructuring efforts in the form of earnings growth. And thanks to our exceptionally strong operating leverage, we expect to continue generating healthy earnings for our shareholders as our top line growth picks up.  Our confidence in the top line is due in part to the fact that we're consistently releasing new versions of our market-leading products, and in part to the fact that we've built a robust pipeline of large deals, which we are well positioned to win.  As always, we remain focused on bringing the greatest possible value to our clients and shareholders and on ensuring the company's long-term financial health and success. With that, I'll turn the call back to Steve for a Q&A period. Steve?
Steve Weber: Thanks, Mark. This concludes our prepared remarks and we're ready now take your questions. Wesley, please open the lines.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Carter Malloy with Stephens Inc.
Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc.: So first thing is the obvious on the revenue front. Can you talk about what types of deals are coming through? It sounds like there's some big license deals potentially there. And in the pipeline, your confidence of closing those, because it looks like you've got to get to $10 million sequential type of bump in revenues to get just to the low end of that guidance range. I just want to get content there. And as you talk about the revenue guidance, is that -- are we looking at the low end of that range or midpoint or actually even above that going into Q4?
Michael Pung: Carter, this is Mike Pung. So couple of major deals that we were expecting to get closed in the third quarter but didn't. And they really range from term license deals in our Tools business and in the Applications business and in particular, deals related to our Falcon product and our Debt Manager products. They're deals that we've been working on for some time. They were well into the selling process and each one had a little bit of a different story behind why we didn't bring them to closure at the end of the month. We've seen some good luck, actually, since July 1 in getting a number of them signed and it gives us some increased confidence in being able to hit the guidance numbers that we've described.
Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc.: Okay. And so if those deals do push it up in $160 million, $165 million rate on that quarter, can we assume what some of that is sort of -- not necessarily one time, but that's a boost to the model and maybe we should temper that back some, or throttle that revenue rate back some as a run rate going forward.
Michael Pung: Yes, that's exactly right. I mean, what we fell short on, roughly the $5 million that Mark referred to in his comments this quarter, we'd see picking that up in our fourth quarter, but that would not be kind of the traditional sequential quarter run rate of revenue growth. It's simply a timing of license deals.
Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc.: Got it, okay. And are there any true-ups in that with the bureaus?
Michael Pung: Not in this quarter, no.
Mark Greene: No.
Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc.: Okay. And then on the expense side, first off, hats off, Mike, to you and your team there. Great job on the OpEx front. You commented on the run rate going forward stepping up with the revenue. Is that on the COGS side or on the OpEx side as well?
Michael Pung: You'll probably see it on the COGS side and then a little bit in SG&A, maybe a $1 million or $2 million increase in our fourth quarter and going forward. Some of it was a matter of timing on period expenses that did not occur in third quarter that we expect to see in the fourth quarter. Other parts of it are the timing where we spend money with respect to our myFICO direct marketing dollars. We had a light quarter in digital marketing spend this quarter. And that's part of what drove the expenses down and that will probably normalize itself out over next quarter and beyond. But we're talking a couple million dollars, not a lot more.
Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc.: Okay and R&D likely to stay here?
Michael Pung: R&D likely to stay in the 9% to 11% range.
Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc.: Okay. And then the other income line where you have interest income of $8 million or so a quarter, was there something in there that helped it, maybe I missed it on the call earlier. But was there an additional component to that, that brought that maybe down this quarter?
Michael Pung: Yes, there was. We actually -- I mentioned earlier we had a favorable tax settlement with one of the state jurisdictions here in the U.S. And it went back to some pretty old periods. They sent us a check and it included a couple million dollars of interest. And we don't book interest income on tax settlements until received. So there's about a $1.8 million to $2 million credit in the interest line item that's nonrecurring.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Thomas Ernst with Deutsche Bank.
Nandan Amladi - Deutsche Bank AG: This is Nandan on behalf of Tom. You talked about, Mike, at the beginning of your section that you're going to continue focusing on revenue growth. Obviously, revenue growth has been a bit challenging. Are you continuing to enhance your product? I mean, what gives you confidence that you might -- should be able to grow revenues going into next year, particularly if the economy remains somewhat tenuous?
Mark Greene: It's Mark. The product updates in innovation, that's not a new phenomena. It's an ongoing one. What's newer is, as you recall, about a year ago, just over a year ago, we brought in a new leader of the sales team. He's brought in quite a bit of leadership underneath him. And I'm quite impressed by the progress that team has made in sort of perfecting their sales process and methodology. We were not happy with the result last quarter; the slips, the deals that pushed was not what we wanted to see. But in general, we have a very professional, very high energy sales team these days. And they're pursuing some very large transactions, much more sort of the solutions sale as opposed to small foreign product sales. So I like the pipeline. The pipeline is healthy, it's well qualified to large interesting [ph] deals and we're making good progress against it.
Nandan Amladi - Deutsche Bank AG: And related to that, you said there was one $3 million deal. I believe I heard that. Was that a suite sale? Or was that a more traditional product sale?
Michael Pung: Let me take a look. That was a suite -- well, that was a traditional product sale. And give me a second, I'll tell you exactly where it was at. It was in our Tools business.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Mr. Weber, there are no further questions at this time.
Steve Weber: Thank you, Wesley. As a reminder, we'll be holding an Analyst Day on November 3 in New York in conjunction with our FICO World Conference, so we hope to see you at that. This concludes our call today. Thank you all for joining.
Mark Greene: Thank you.
Operator: That does conclude today's FICO Third Quarter Earnings Call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2011 Q2  (2011-05-05 17:00:00) =====

Analysts: Michael Nemeroff - Wedbush Securities Inc. Nathaniel Otis - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc. Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Mike, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the FICO Second Quarter 2011 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Weber, you may begin your conference call.
Steve Weber: Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining FICO's second quarter earnings call. I'm Steven Weber, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by CEO, Mark Greene; and CFO, Mike Pung. You will find on the Investor Relations portion of the FICO website a copy of today's press release, our Regulation G Disclosure schedule and our financial highlights. While our press release describes financial results compared to the prior year, today management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular, in the Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. In order to provide additional information to investors, we will use certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, entitled Regulation G Disclosure, is available on the Investors page of our website under the Presentations tab. A replay of this webcast will be available through June 4, 2011. Now I will turn the call over to Mark Greene.
Mark Greene: Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon. We'll proceed as usual today in 3 parts. First, I'll summarize the quarterly results and assess our business in light of current market conditions. Then Mike Pung will provide further financial details. And finally, I'll discuss our business outlook for the balance of fiscal 2011 before we take your questions. For the second quarter fiscal 2011, revenue was $153 million, down $3 million over the prior quarter, but up $9 million or 6% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share in the quarter were $0.39, down $0.05 from last quarter but up 39% year-over-year. Bookings were $58 million compared to $84 million last quarter and $54 million in the second quarter of 2010.  Year-to-date, revenue and bookings have grown 5% and 24%, respectively, from the prior year. Our Applications and Tools revenues were up 7% to 8% while Scores are down 3%. Let me break out our quarterly performance for the 3 segments of our Decision Management portfolio. First, the Applications segment consists of business software used by clients to help make smarter decisions over a customer life cycle. Revenues from such applications was $96 million in the quarter, down 2% sequentially and up 10% from the same period last year.  We saw improved performance from our Fraud and Originations [Fraud Management and Originations] solutions, mainly as a result of several very large license deals signed during the quarter. We had another solid quarter in the Fraud Management business, which consists of Insurance Fraud Manager and Falcon Fraud Manager for banking.  Fraud Management bookings exceeded $40 million for the quarter and revenue grew 3% from Q1, which is our largest quarter since the third quarter of 2008. We remained very pleased with the performance of these strong franchises. We signed another large Originations Manager deal during this quarter with the North American Bank, which is our third deal since we released this offer last December.  Originations revenue grew 11%, sequentially, and 27% from the prior year, and bookings exceeded $10 million during the quarter. Next, we'll look at our Scores segment, which consists of predictive analytics used to assess risk. Overall, Scores revenue was $41 million, flat from the prior quarter. We tracked 2 subsegments here. B2B [business-to-business] scores which are scores sold to financial institutions and B2C [business-to-consumer] scores which are scores sold directly to consumers at our myFICO website. And on a direct basis -- I'm sorry, and indirectly to consumers through bureau partners. The B2B scores subsegment continues to track with the slow improvement in the economy, and B2B scores revenue was down slightly from the previous quarter. As we move forward, we are focused on maintaining our market leadership in this area, in anticipation of a return to meaningful growth as the economy recovers. Quarter highlights include, first, as we saw a continued increase in marketing acquisition activities across the U.S. Scores business, with a 90% quarterly increase over the prior year, led by both direct sales to customers, as well as through our distribution partners. This is one of the leading indicator that originations, which is up 1% in the U.S. over the prior year. We view this as an encouraging indicator of future growth. In the quarter, we also saw an increase in the market adoption of the latest version of the classic FICO Score which we call FICO 8, with approximately 4,000 lenders now using FICO 8 within their risk management practices. That represents a 14% increase quarter-over-quarter, and a further sign of FICO strong market position and continued success in meeting the needs of our customers. In March, we announced that the automobile finance industry is migrating to the FICO 8 auto score, with most lenders completing the adoption process by May. FICO Scores are the established credit scoring standard in the auto industry, and are used by lenders and dealers as part of auto loan and lease originations, and for servicing and loss management activities. The industry-wide migration to the new FICO 8 auto score will allow vendors and dealers to share more consistent information, as they finance vehicle sales and because of the scores superior ability to assess risks, extend credit to their customers with greater confidence. Finally on Scores. As part of our continued investment in analytic innovation, in April, we announced a new research into the capability to predict strategic defaults in the mortgage industry. This is an important breakthrough regarding one of the most troubling trends emerging from the recent trouble in the housing market. People who choose to walk away from mortgage obligations that they can actually afford. Our FICO lab team demonstrated the ability to predict with unprecedented accuracy that the individuals at greatest risk of strategic defaults. Among the research findings is that people who commit strategic defaults have different profiles from the high risk individuals who default on mortgage based on inability to pay.  Industry interest in this strategic default solution is very strong, and we're currently working with the largest North American mortgage lenders to validate our research on their mortgage portfolios. Turning now to the consumer segment of the Scores business. Revenue increased substantially for direct sales to consumers in myFICO.com, driving 9% overall growth sequentially. The increase was partially offset by decline in revenue generated from our bureau channel partner, selling FICO Scores to consumers. Our third and final business segment is Tools, which consist of rules management, modeling and optimization products, embedded within our applications and also sold standalone to clients building their own applications. Revenue in this Tools segment was $16 million during the quarter, down 9% from last quarter but up 11% from the prior year and up 7% year-to-date. While this business has fluctuated due to economic uncertainties, we remain confident in our product offering and pipeline.  So to summarize the quarter, we streamlined our cost structure and we allocated our resources towards growth opportunities, product innovation and client service. We achieved solid results across all 3 segments, with continued signs of stabilization in scores and growth in our Applications and Tools segment. Bookings were $58 million, a 6% increase over the comparable quarter last year.  Now let me pass the call to Mike Pung for further financial details.
Michael Pung: Thanks, Mark. I want to emphasize 3 points in my prepared comments today. First, our year-to-date revenue was up 5% from last year. We grew our Applications and Tools business and continued to see stability in our Scores business.  Second, in February, we restructured our costs to enhance our operating leverage which we began to see reflected in this quarter's results. Adjusted operating margins expanded slightly and are expected to grow in the second half of the year, and free cash flow was $53 million during the first half of the year.  Finally, we will be reiterating our annual revenue guidance. Mark has already discussed our revenue results by segment, so I'll provide some additional comments as they relate to specific aspects of our business. Revenue for the quarter was $153 million. By region, this quarter, 73% of total revenue was derived from the Americas region versus 77% in the prior quarter. Our EMEA region generated 20% of our revenue compared to 17% in the prior quarter, and the remaining 7% was from Asia-Pacific, compared to 6% in the prior quarter. By type of revenue. Recurring revenue, which is derived from transactional and maintenance sources, for the quarter, represented 73% of total revenues versus 74% in the prior quarter. Consulting and implementation revenues were 18% of total revenues, this quarter and last quarter. And license revenues were 9% of total revenue versus 8% last quarter. We continue to expect license revenues as a percent of total revenue to increase for the remainder of the fiscal year.  Turning to bookings. We've generated $17 million of current period revenue on bookings of $58 million, a 29% yield. This compares with $17 million of revenue on bookings of $84 million, which was a 20% yield in the prior quarter. The weighted average term of our bookings for the quarter was 19 months compared to 42 months in the prior quarter. During this quarter, our mix of bookings was more heavily weighted towards license and services, while revenue was realized in a shorter duration when compared to our transactional bookings. Of the $58 million in bookings, 25% related to Fraud Management products, 18% related to Originations products, 17% to Decision Management Tools and 13% to customer management products. We had 12 booking deals in excess of $1 million, one of which exceeded $3 million. Transactional and maintenance bookings were 29% of total this quarter versus 60% last quarter. Professional service bookings were 48% this quarter versus 25% in the prior quarter. And finally, license bookings were 23% in the quarter versus 15% last quarter. On to operating expenses. Our operating expenses excluding the restructuring charge totaled $122 million this quarter, down $3 million from the prior quarter. This decline was primarily related to the savings from the cost restructuring we announced in the middle of the quarter.  We expect a further decline in operating expenses in the third quarter and the rest of the year, as we see the full impact from these announced reductions. Finally, our restructuring charge was $11.5 million, larger than what we announced in February, due to some additional actions taken before the end of March. As you can see on our Reg G schedule, non-GAAP operating margin before amortization, stock-based compensation and the restructuring, was 24% for the second quarter compared to 23% in the prior quarter. GAAP net income was $8 million but excluding the restructuring charge, it was $16 million, consistent with the prior quarter. The effective tax rate was about 30%, consistent with our guidance. Free cash flow. As you know, we define free cash flow as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and dividends paid. Free cash flow for the quarter was $22 million or 15% of revenue, compared to $31 million or 20% of revenue in the prior quarter. Year-to-date, free cash flow is $53 million, due in part to a $7 million decline in our accounts receivable and a $6 million increase in deferred revenue. Now moving on to the balance sheet. We have $263 million in cash and marketable securities on our balance sheet. This increased from last quarter due to our operating cash flow minus the shares that we repurchased during the quarter.  Our total debt remains at $520 million with a weighted average interest rate of 6.1% and our cost of debt remains at about $8 million per quarter. The ratio of our total net debt to adjusted EBITDA is at 1.9x below the covenant level of 3x. Our total fixed charge coverage ratio is at 3.6x, well above the covenant level of 2.5x. We had no borrowings under our line of credit facility, and anticipate that we will refinance it before it matures in October. This quarter, we repurchased 629,000 shares of stock at a total cost of $17.1 million or about $27.25 per share, and have $157 million remaining under our current board authorization. We continue to evaluate the best way to deploy excess cash to maximize shareholder value and consider our share repurchase plan a very attractive use of our cash flow. We also regularly evaluate and consider opportunities to acquire relevant technologies and products that advance our strategy or strengthen our portfolio and competitive position. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Mark.
Mark Greene: In this concluding section, I'll discuss our prospects and outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2011. Concerning our Applications and Tools business, we are seeing gradual signs of improved spending on technology, with budgets beginning to ease and investments being made across the markets we serve, with a predictably strong quarter in both Europe and Asia Pacific, and we see a healthy pipeline of opportunities both there and in the Americas in the second half of the fiscal year. Concerning prospects for our Scores business. Although marketing solicitations have grown, we continue to be concerned about the outlook for the mortgage activity during the remainder of the year. Recent reports on existing home sales, housing starts, foreclosure activity and employment confirm the we're still in a slow recovery. The net of these offsetting trends is that we continue to expect our total B2B scores revenue to grow over time at roughly the rate of GDP.  For our B2C business, revenue growth will be largely tied to the success of our marketing efforts through myFICO.com. From an operational perspective, we've now streamlined our organization and realigned our investment in support of areas with the greatest potential for growth. We also made a management change in our Scores unit, and remain confident that we are properly focused on delivering superior analytics into the marketplace. Taken together, these actions enable us to compete more aggressively and win more deals.  Now the guidance for the remainder of fiscal year. We're updating our previous guidance for FY '11 to account for the impact of the final restructuring charge during last quarter. The updated guidance is as follows: Revenue of $620 million to $625 million, unchanged from our previously stated guidance, but with growing confidence in delivering the high end of this range; net income of $68 million to $72 million on a GAAP basis, with its previous GAAP guidance of $70 million to $73 million; excluding restructuring charges, non-GAAP net income of $77 million to $81 million versus the previously stated $76 million to $80 million. GAAP earnings per share of $1.71 to $1.81 versus $1.75 to $1.83. And excluding the restructuring charges, non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.93 to $2.03 versus $1.90 to $2. In closing, I'd like to reiterate my confidence in the direction we're headed. The markets we serve are coming back to life. Our revenues and pipeline are increasingly healthy. And our clients tell me consistently that FICO solutions get right to the heart of their most pressing challenges. We remain focused on bringing the greatest possible value to our clients and shareholders, and to ensuring the company's long-term financial health and success. With that, I'll turn the call back to Steve for a question and answer. Steve?
Steve Weber: Thanks, Mark. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we're ready now to take your questions. Mike, please open the line.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays Capital.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital: First question is just around, I guess, could you give us an updated headcount number, what it looks like at the end of the quarter and may be what it is today. And just around that, I just wanted to get your take in terms of your comfort level around with all the significant cost-cutting initiatives that you guys are undertaking, how comfortably do you feel whether or not that cutting into the muscle of the company, and I guess if not was there just too much excess that time around?
Mark Greene: The headcount at the end of the quarter was about 2,030.
Michael Pung: 2,033 to be exact.
Mark Greene: I guess I wouldn't characterize that level in either the way that you post. I think we learned during the downturn as to many of our customers become ever more productive and efficient and we saw an opportunity to do that one more time, largely by flattening some of the organizational structure that we had. We're pretty lean and efficient these days. I don't think we've cut too deeply. But I also would say that there's probably not an additional restructuring that we can contemplate doing. I think we've gotten down to the level of efficiency that feels right for this time, and we know how to run the business at this level.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital: Great. And just one more sort of, I guess, big picture question around. Maybe a little more color you talked about a little -- I guess the slow recovery but you also threw in a few data points in that way, the leading indicator seemed to be showing nicely for you guys, looking ahead. So I guess related to that, the revenue guidance that you maintained, does that -- I guess does that not take into account what the leading indicators could mean for you guys? Or does that basically means that maybe you see a little more lag before those leading indicator actually start throwing in that extra benefit for you guys?
Mark Greene: Good question. First, I would point out the language used in reiterating our revenue guidance that, there's increasing comfort about achieving the high end of that range, right. So that's -- which rose this quarter. In terms of the leading indicators, there's two subs to them. We do, in fact, like what we see in terms of the pipeline for Applications and Tools. Those numbers are growing, and they look quite healthy in the back of the year. With respect to Scores, we are happy with the amount of marketing and originations activity taking place at the front end of that life cycle, but there is some concern in the marketplace about the rate on which those marketing solicitations get converted into new business. I don't think that's a phenomenon unique to us. But as we check with a number of players in the industry, not all of the market solicitations are converting to new business at the rate that they used to prior to the recession.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Nemeroff from Wedbush Securities.
Michael Nemeroff - Wedbush Securities Inc.: Just following up on Manav's question and Mark's answer about the conversion rates. Looking at the score in revenue from last year, Mark, it was actually up, I think, there was a true up in Q3, based on your commentary with the conversion it's not really coming in as high as maybe they were in the past. Would you expect that Scoring revenue to be down year-over-year again, especially on the transactional and maintenance line?
Michael Pung: Yes, Mike. This is Mike Pung here. We expect that scores to be relatively flat or up slightly. If you exclude the true up that we had last year in the third quarter.
Michael Nemeroff - Wedbush Securities Inc.: And just remind us again how much that true up represented?
Michael Pung: We said last year were several million dollars, so between $3 million to $4 million.
Michael Nemeroff - Wedbush Securities Inc.: Okay, between $3 million to $4 million. And then, Mike, if you wouldn't mind just maybe talk about the cash flow targets. You obviously had a couple of quarters in the cash flow side. Do you think that you've maybe pull forward some stuff and collections have been a little bit stronger than you thought, and then maybe give us an update on what you're expecting for the year for operating and as well as free cash?
Michael Pung: Yes. We're maintaining the same guidance that I gave you last quarter. For the annual free cash flow to be somewhere between $90 million and $95 million. As you know, it can fluctuate a little higher, a little lower depending on the timing of payments, primarily on the receivables side. But we feel pretty good about the $90 million to $95 million level.
Michael Nemeroff - Wedbush Securities Inc.: And then one last one, if I may, to Mark. Mark, I think you guys mentioned in your remarks you talked about maybe putting some capital to use for acquisitions. I don't think I've heard that commentary in several quarters and I was just wondering if there are any specific areas that maybe you think that you could share with us where you'd like to target.
Mark Greene: I can't be overly specific. It is true that we are looking these days and I'll remind you of previous, say, the philosophy, which is we look for niche capabilities to supplement our existing portfolio. So we're not looking to buy new customers or new revenue sources. We're looking to buy technologies that would be more cheaply acquired and built, and we can see places in our product portfolio where such investments might strengthen our Applications portfolio. So we're looking, and we're sending a message that says we're active in the space but nothing further to announce.
Michael Nemeroff - Wedbush Securities Inc.: Okay. And then just one last one if I may. For Mike, so the restructurings were down, I mean, we're not going to see anymore restructurings going forward related to the most recent announcements.
Michael Pung: No, we could be $11.5 million this quarter and to the degree there any adjustments going forward, I would expect them to be simply true ups of minor items related to our facilities.
Mark Greene: So Mike, I think you understood we really only saw about a half quarters worth the benefit of those restructurings in last quarter. And the reason why Mike comments said that we expect OpEx to climb down this quarter is that we got the full quarter's worth of benefit.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nat Otis from KBW.
Nathaniel Otis - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.: When you talk about FICO 8 and auto industry, any thoughts on the financial impact to the switching any way?
Mark Greene: No. The upgrades from prior generations to new generations this quarter is coming at no incremental revenue to us. What they do, do is secure that base, if you will, for many years to come. So Scores are typically used for 5, 7, 10 years time, getting an entire industry sectors such as auto on to our newest version. So it locks in and secures that revenue stream. But it's not an incremental lift beyond the revenue stream that was there before.
Nathaniel Otis - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.: How long do you we think something like that will take ultimately?
Mark Greene: Well, the conversion of that particular industry is the recurring in a small number of months, and that has a 3 or 4 months in part because they're such interconnecting that's across the auto players that they sort of move as a group, and we've been working very actively with them to support them in that sort of bulk transition. But as indicated, auto players and many other industry sectors once they settle on a score that works with them typically used it for a minimum of 5 years. It's uncommon to see swap out of scores generations within less than 5 years.
Nathaniel Otis - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.: Then just quickly on the balance sheet. Looks like you shifted a good amount from marketable securities to just cash. Anything there to read or anything important there?
Michael Pung: No, all we were doing is changes in some banking relationships and some banking structures but nothing more than that.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Michael Nemeroff from Wedbush Securities.
Michael Nemeroff - Wedbush Securities Inc.: Just a question, if I may, on the competition, specifically around the Tools division. Is there anything that's happening, obviously, it was a good quarter. So I was just trying to see if there's any change in the competition and who you're seeing? And then also in scoring, do you still, are you seeing or hearing any of the banks that you're working with talking about VantageScore using it in production because it's something that a lot of investors asked us, I believe.
Mark Greene: With respect to the Tools business, the primary competitor there remains when we talked about in the past, IBM, with their high-reward product. I guess, I have growing confidence in what I stated before that the market supports two players in that race and there's ample evidence to believe that we and they can both succeed and we like where we're going with the Blaze product and we tend to compete with slightly different opportunities and IBM does. We walk through things that are tend to be more industry dense and they tend to have more sort of generic solutions but there's room for both of us. You should also note that in the quarter we did have one large optimization deal that helped the numbers and that is our so-called express optimization product that plays nicely with Blaze.  With respect to Scores and VantageScore, we continue to believe that our product and technology is superior to theirs. We do know that there's a lot of marketing activity underway on their part. We continue to be of the view that before that, while customers are benchmarking and evaluating lots of alternatives, and we see some pricing pressure, et cetera, I'm not aware that we've lost customers to VantageScore.
Michael Nemeroff - Wedbush Securities Inc.: Thanks, Mark. And then just in the Scoring business itself, you'd just give us the Scoring revenue but we've got that breakdown of the transaction and maintenance, professional services and license. What is the license and that actually had step function up in terms of that revenue, it's small obviously. But I just want to understand are you selling it as an all-you-can-eat license or if you could just maybe go into detail about that.
Mark Greene: There's no difference, there's no change, Michael, in the model for selling scores. The small incidental license, transactions are transactions that we've done outside the U.S. but in a very minor way.
Michael Nemeroff - Wedbush Securities Inc.: So the comparison to last year show that you didn't have any, so that would mean that you just didn't sell any outside the U.S. of that time?
Mark Greene: That's right.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time.
Mark Greene: Thank you, Mike. This concludes our call. Thank you all for joining.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.
