===== 2025 Q1  (2025-04-24 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to today's Tyler Technologies First Quarter 2025 Conference Call. Your host for today's call is Lynn Moore, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at that time. In order to address your questions and stay within the allotted time, please limit your question to one question per person. You may get back into the queue for a follow-up. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, 04/24/2025. I would like to turn the call over to Hala Elsherbini, Tyler's Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Hala Elsherbini: Thank you, Rob. Welcome to our call. With me today is Lynn Moore, our president and chief executive officer, and Brian Miller, our chief financial officer. After I give the safe harbor statement, Lynn will have some initial comments on our quarter and then Brian will review the details of our results and update our annual guidance for 2025. Lynn will end with some additional comments, and then we'll take your questions. During this call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information and may include projections concerning the company's future prospects, revenues, expenses, and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Also, in our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release.

Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Lynn?
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Hala. Our first quarter results provided a strong start to the year, reflecting disciplined execution around our strategic initiatives. We exceeded expectations across key revenue and profitability metrics and achieved double-digit total revenue growth fueled by robust growth in subscription revenues. SaaS revenues grew 21%, marking our seventeenth consecutive quarter of SaaS growth of 20% or more. Transaction-based revenues were ahead of plan and grew 18.5%, driven by higher transaction volumes, including increased adoption and deployment of new transaction-based services. Our non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 26.8%, benefiting from efficiencies across our cloud operations, a mix shift to higher-margin SaaS revenues and away from lower-margin professional service and hardware revenues, and favorable operating expense trends. In addition, free cash flow of $48 million was ahead of our plan. Our cloud transition is driving efficiency gains through progress with version consolidation and cloud-optimized releases that enhance scalability in Tyler's next-generation cloud offering. Our Cloud First strategy further strengthens the resilience and durability of our business model. We are uniquely positioned to support our clients through their cloud journey as they embrace digital modernization and integrated technologies that prioritize efficiencies, optimize workflows, improve decision-making, and provide enhanced security. Our ability to deliver exceptionally strong results and maintain a positive outlook for the balance of the year in the midst of unpredictable macro conditions illustrates the stability of our business and the resilience of our model. While we are not completely immune to the macro conditions affecting many companies, I can say that any impacts we are currently seeing, whether from cuts in federal funding for agencies, caution around spending, or potential tariffs on hardware, are minimal and just around the margins of our businesses. We are not currently seeing any fundamental changes in demand or buying behavior. The public sector market remains active, as evidenced by RFPs and sales demonstration activity that are stable at elevated levels. Some procurement processes have slowed due to two things: one, a higher number of consultant-driven processes which tend to elongate sales cycles, and two, additional scrutiny or uncertainty around the macro environment. But these are fairly isolated and represent a minority of our pipeline. The strength of our pipeline reflects the benefits of our competitive position as the industry leader, together with a unified sales organization collaborating at heightened levels to leverage our unmatched installed base, identifying secure cross-sell opportunities, and driving multi-suite deal momentum. Additionally, we continue to expand synergies across Tyler at the state level, building out sales resources with a dedicated state sales team that will serve as a strategic bridge to leverage our deep state enterprise relationships and identify and capture sales opportunities for software across Tyler. Our leadership team has experienced challenged macro environments in the past, and that experience gives us confidence in the resilience and stability of the public sector market and our business model. At the local government level, which makes up the vast majority of our revenues, budgets that support purchases from Tyler are primarily funded by property taxes, in addition to utility revenues and other locally generated sources. Revenue streams that tend to be reliable even in shifting economic environments. This funding stability supports consistent long-term demand driven by the need to replace aging, mission-critical systems that have reached end of life. At the state level, a majority of our transaction revenues come through self-funded services or user fees that do not require appropriated funds from a state budget. Most of these services, like driver's license renewals, are nondiscretionary and are generally not impacted by economic conditions. This year, the new acronym DOGE has become part of our vocabulary. While less than 5% of our revenues come from the federal government, the focus on efficiency is becoming more visible at all levels of government. We have not seen and do not currently anticipate any meaningful negative impact on our business from DOGE or similar initiatives, as the vast majority of the software and services we provide are considered essential and actually enhance efficiency. Rather than viewing these initiatives as a risk, we see opportunities in aligning with efficiency objectives such as those outlined in DOGE, which emphasize modernizing technology as a key component of maximizing governmental efficiency and productivity. In fact, section four of the executive order establishing DOGE is entitled "Modernizing Federal Technology and Software to Maximize Efficiency and Productivity" and states that the USPS administrator shall commence a software modernization initiative to improve the quality and efficiency of government-wide software, network infrastructure, and information technology systems, and that, among other things, the USDS administrator shall work with agency heads to promote interoperability between agency networks and systems. As public sector agencies manage through the challenge of aging IT infrastructure and limited resources, we are well-positioned to support their digital modernization efficiency initiatives with our cloud-based integrated software solutions. I'm pleased with the solid execution across Tyler supporting our four key growth pillars: completing our cloud transition, leveraging our large client base, growing our payments business, and expanding into new markets. I'd like to highlight a few first-quarter wins that illustrate our progress against our growth objectives. These include a full enterprise justice on-premises to cloud migration with the Cleveland, Ohio Municipal Court for approximately $800,000 in ARR. Our courts and justice team executed this SaaS flip in just one weekend following a cybersecurity incident, with operations quickly and safely restored in a new cloud environment. A five-year appraisal services privatization contract with Gwinnett County, Georgia, valued at a total of $8.7 million. A fast contract with Fulton County, Georgia, for enterprise records management representing $500,000 in ARR plus payments. This cross-sell deal leveraged our strong existing presence in Fulton County with our enterprise appraisal and tax and enterprise justice solutions. And building on our momentum from last quarter, we had seven wins for our AI-driven priority-based budgeting solution, including the cities of Dallas, Texas, Olympia, Washington, and Bloomington, Minnesota. For the quarter, we signed a total of 106 flips to the cloud of on-premises clients, with a 28% increase in total contract value from flips. In our state enterprise business, we secured three-year extensions for our digital government services with the states of Connecticut and New Mexico, representing more than $8 million in ARR. We signed 96 new payment deals across Tyler software clients, representing approximately $4.4 million in projected ARR. We also signed a five-year extension of our payment processing contract with the state of Florida, representing approximately $31 million in ARR. Now I'd like Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our annual guidance for 2025.
Brian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. Total revenues for the quarter were $565.2 million, up 10.3%. Subscriptions revenue increased 19.7%. Within subscription, SaaS revenues grew 21% to $180.1 million. Keep in mind that there is often a lag from the signing of a new SaaS deal or a flip to the start of revenue recognition that can vary from one to several quarters. Because of this, as well as the timing of SaaS renewals and related price increases, SaaS revenue growth both year over year and sequentially may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Transaction revenues grew 18.5% to $194.9 million, driven by higher transaction volumes from both new and existing clients and increased adoption and deployment of new transaction-based services, as well as rate increases by third-party payment processing partners. Total bookings for Q1 were down 1.9% year over year. Transaction bookings exhibited solid growth, reflecting higher payment volumes from new and existing customers, as well as new services in areas such as outdoor recreation and digital motor vehicle titling. SaaS bookings declined from last year's Q1, which we attribute to several factors. As we noted on the previous earnings call, some deals that would have signed this quarter were pulled forward into Q4 because of the year-end deadline for committing ARPA funds. While we don't believe that there has been any fundamental change in demand, as evidenced by continued strength in new RFPs and our deep pipeline, we have seen some instances of longer sales processes that we believe represent timing changes rather than cancellation of procurement. As Lynn noted, we believe that an increase in consultant-driven processes, as well as caution exhibited by some prospects in light of uncertain macroeconomic conditions, are contributing to those delays. In addition, the timing of decisions in the market has always been lumpy, and this was a quarter where there simply were fewer procurements that reached the final decision or contract stage. SaaS deals comprised approximately 96% of our new software contract value compared to 93% last year. During the quarter, we added 38 new SaaS arrangements and signed 106 SaaS flips of existing on-premises clients, with a total contract value of approximately $67 million. In Q1 of last year, we added 200 new SaaS arrangements and had 90 flips with a total contract value of approximately $78 million. The average ARR from new SaaS contracts was approximately $53,000, down 3% over last year. The average ARR associated with our Q1 flips was flat with last year at approximately $113,000. Our total annualized recurring revenue was $1.95 billion, up 13.3%. Our non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 26.8%, up 300 basis points from last year. The margin expansion reflects the impact of our cloud efficiency initiative, a positive change in our revenue mix with lower professional services and hardware, along with leverage in operating expenses. As we discussed on previous calls, Merchant and Interchange fees from our payments business under the gross revenue model have a meaningful impact on our overall margins, as they are included in both revenues and cost of revenues. We incurred merchant fees of approximately $50 million in Q1 compared to $42 million last year. Cash flows from operations and free cash flow were ahead of plan at $56.2 million and $48.3 million, respectively. We ended the quarter with $600 million of convertible debt outstanding, and cash and investments of approximately $810 million and net leverage of zero. In light of our strong first-quarter results and our positive outlook for the balance of the year, we have revised our annual guidance for 2025 as follows. We expect total revenues will be between $2.31 billion and $2.35 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 9%. We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be between $7.50 and $7.80 and may vary significantly due to the impact of discrete tax items on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $11.05 and $11.35. Our estimated non-GAAP tax rate for 2025 is expected to be 22.5%. We expect our free cash flow margin will be between 24% and 26%, including an estimated impact of approximately $40 million of cash taxes related to Section 174. We expect research and development expense will be in the range of $193 million to $198 million. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release and in the Q1 earnings deck posted on our website. I'd like to add some additional color around our guidance. While the annual growth ranges for most of our revenue lines are unchanged from our previous guidance, we now expect that transaction revenues will grow between 12% and 14%, with merchant fees essentially flat year over year. This increase reflects the higher transaction volumes and rate increases that positively impacted the first quarter, as well as an expectation that some payment services under the Texas contract may extend beyond August. We now expect that revenues for the year under the Texas contract will be approximately $37 million compared to $45 million last year. We also expect that sales and marketing expense for the year will decline 2% to 4% due to alignment of sales compensation structures across Tyler. Excluding merchant fees that are absorbed under the gross revenue model, expected transactions growth in 2025 at the midpoint of our guidance would be approximately 17%, and total growth would be approximately 10%. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn.
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. Our team members continue to deliver results and execute at a high level against our strategic roadmap leading toward our Tyler 2030 vision. Our exceptionally strong results in the midst of unpredictable macroeconomic conditions illustrate the stability of our business and the resilience of our model. We provide solutions that manage mission-critical functions across an extensive client base that offers tremendous long-term cross-sell opportunities. And our recurring revenues, which comprise 86% of our total, have proven to be very sticky. In this environment of heightened focus on government and digital transformation, we are uniquely positioned to help governments at all levels achieve their goals. We continue to prioritize innovation and are making meaningful progress with our AI initiatives as we invest in innovation to empower the public sector. We are taking an intentional and responsible approach centered on three core pillars: productivity, decision-making, and service delivery. Our singular focus on the public sector allows us to leverage decades of experience to deliver software and services that empower our clients to create smarter, safer, and stronger communities. We look forward to highlighting our AI strategy at Tyler Connect 2025, which will be held in San Antonio from May 11 to May 14. Some 5,500 Tyler clients and nearly 900 Tyler team members will gather to learn, share best practices, collaborate, and network. We look forward to seeing many of you there, including at our investor session at Connect on May 12. We will review our progress since our 2023 Investor Day with plans to host a full investor day next year. We also look forward to introducing our recently appointed chief client officer, Andrew Call, at Connect. Andrew's focus on enhancing client experience and building upon our One Tyler client-centric approach is vital to creating seamless client experiences across Tyler's vast public sector client base and to achieving our 2030 vision. I'd like to highlight additional recent leadership transitions and promotions. Jeff Green has announced his intent to retire this June. Throughout his 22-year career with Tyler, Jeff has provided invaluable leadership and expertise, most recently as our chief technology officer. Russell Gainford has been appointed to succeed Jeff as chief technology officer, where he now oversees the strategic leadership of our technology organization. Russell's vision for Tyler's technology discipline is an organizational structure that serves the needs of our clients, market, and business leaders. Joining Russell in this effort is Franklin Williams, with an expanded role as deputy chief technology officer. He will work directly with Russell to drive our common technology strategy, developer experience, and adoption of emerging technologies, including AI. Lastly, we recently published our sixth annual corporate responsibility report on our website. We're proud to share updates on our ongoing efforts that are aligned to our broader strategic and mix objectives and invite you to review the report to learn more about our corporate governance achievements, team member initiatives, and company impact. Now we'd like to open the line for Q&A.
Operator: We will now begin the question and answer session. To withdraw your request, again, press 1. As a reminder, please limit your question to one question so we may stay within the allotted time. We will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. Your first question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Kirk Materne: Yes. Thanks very much. Thanks, Lynn and Brian. Good to talk to you. Lynn, maybe just two. I'll ask them just consecutively. I guess, first, for you, Lynn, obviously, you guys have been through a lot of macro cycles. What's the leading indicator you're looking at just in terms of sort of the health of the business? You guys mentioned RFPs, but I was just wondering if you could add a little color to what you're keeping an eye on just to make sure that the macro sort of volatility is not seeping into sort of customer thought processes. And then, Brian, for you, you know, the ARR number was also down a little bit this quarter year over year. I assume it sort of plays into that broader commentary you had on SaaS deals, but I was wondering if you could just add a little bit more color on that as well. Thanks.
Lynn Moore: Yeah. Sure, Kirk. That's a good question. And you're right. We have been through, some of us have been here a long time. We've been through some of these cycles. What we do is, you know, look. We get together every quarter. We get with our sales teams. They give us an outlook. We track going back multiple quarters RFP activity, demo activity, you know, deals that are not happening without our RFPs, and those are things we focus on. Our RFP activity has been elevated for the last couple of years, and it's staying steady at that level. Our demo activity similarly is steady and, in some cases, actually up. So, correct. That, any changes really related to the decline in year-over-year lower bookings in the SaaS side, which I mentioned the reasons for.
Ken Wong: Your question comes from the line of Ken Wong from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Ken Wong: Perfect. Thanks for taking my question. And I guess this would go to Lynn or Brian. But on that softer booking side, you guys called out, you know, kinda consultant deals maybe seeing a little bit of a push out or any reason to think that that could materialize into something more concerning? I mean, what's your confidence that those deals will get over the finish line versus, I mean, we've seen the headlines with, you know, significant slashes in IT services and just love any color there from either of you.
Lynn Moore: Yeah. I'll start, Ken. I would say, generally, if you go back historically, we also don't talk about contracts that have been awarded and not signed yet. And we've mentioned a few different things on bookings. One was we did pull forward some deals at the end of Q4, particularly in our public administration suite. Our justice suite generally tends to be a little more lumpy, but I can have pretty good confidence that some of that lumpiness from Q1 will actually come back in Q2. I'd say the consultant thing is more anecdotal than really a driving factor right now. And so, you know, I think generally, again, I'd just mentioned it in my response to Kirk. You know, every quarter, we get together, look at the results of the business, but we spend a lot of time from our sales leaders, you know, diving down, looking at their plans, looking at the deals that were closed, looking at the pipeline, you know, looking at the awards that we have, seeing where we track against our internal plans. And so, you know, sitting here today, I would say Q1 was more of an anomaly than it was something of a trend.
Terry Tillman: Your next question comes from the line of Terry Tillman from Truist Securities. Your line is open.
Terry Tillman: Yeah. Hey, Lynn, Brian, and Hala. Hopefully, you can hear me okay. Hala. It's a question that might actually be two parts. But sorry about that ahead of time. But just one thing is on the bookings, it was good to see that the contract value on flips up though year over year. And then the new deals, obviously, was down year over year. But as you look to the rest of the year, in terms of visibility and just kind of execution risk and what seems kind of easier to plan for, how does it feel on the flip side versus new SaaS bookings? And then, Brian, the contract duration, that was 2.7 years, that definitely came down from anything to think about going forward? Thank you.
Brian Miller: Yeah. I'll start, Terry. You know, on the flip side, I think we're generally on pace when and as I look out for the rest of the year, you know, I don't see any change from our internal plan from where we started the year. There's, you know, always differences in different parts of the business. But we're seeing, for example, in the court space, we're starting to see more and more interest in our flips. We highlighted recently, you know, our state of Idaho flip, and once you start getting some of that kind of traction, we're starting to see more interest there. On the flip side, I think we're fine. And on SaaS, again, a little bit of softness this quarter, but it's not softness in the market. It was more softness around timing. And on the average duration, it, you know, just bounces around a little bit from quarter to quarter. Our standard sort of the standard term is three years. And this quarter, there were deals that range from one year to five years. So I'd think, generally, we're gonna be close clustered around that three-year average, but just the mix on individual client preference can affect how we move around that standard three-year number.
Michael Turrin: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
Michael Turrin: Hey, great. Thanks. Appreciate you taking the question. I want to just try to tie some of the comments together. We're getting questions on the bookings and new deal metrics from Q1. Lynn mentioned some Q4 pull forward. So it sounds like maybe it's more of that than the consulting commentary that may have had an impact on Q1. And then on the consulting commentary, is there anything you see internally that you can do on your side to just work around any impacts there on the fringe given you're more focused on software? I think the public sector spend focus is more on software than services spend. I'm just wondering are any plays you can run that just can help continue to build on some of the momentum you're citing with RFPs. Thank you.
Brian Miller: Yeah, Michael. I'll start. I'll reiterate that the comment on the consultants is again more anecdotal. I don't think that's, you know, a major driver. Obviously, all of our business isn't done through RFP, but that's where it flows through. We did have, we talked about it at the end of Q4 back in February. We had a few deals that were pulled forward, as some of our clients were trying to use ARPA funds before the deadline. I think a lot of it has just been, you know, the business is there. What we've seen in certain parts of our business, awards have delayed a little bit. We've also continued to see the lumpiness in some of our other deals. And I want to emphasize that as we look out to the year and we look out on our internal sales goals, a little bit of soft bookings is not causing a concern for me. I think you'll see a pickup of some of these deals that we've been awarded but not yet reached contract stage in Q1, following Q2.
Lynn Moore: And just to clarify around the consultant comment, we're referring to where a prospect is using a third-party consultant like a Gartner to manage the procurement process or assist them in the procurement process. We're not referring to where the deal is being where we're a sub to a systems integrator or a consultant in terms of the services delivery. It's really how the procurement is being managed by the prospect.
Alexei Gogolev: Your next question comes from the line of Alexei Gogolev from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Alexei Gogolev: Hello, everyone. Lynn, if I may ask, one more question about the flips. I think in the past, you suggested that you had about 400 flips last year. And we're hoping to see about 550 this year. With 106 in Q1, are you still on track for that 550 target?
Brian Miller: I think, Alexei, I think we're I don't have that right in front of me. You know, flips vary from quarter to quarter. Our flips are up, what do they have? From last year up? 18%. In number. So, you know, if that holds, we'll be pushing close to 500. I think, importantly, we're also on track with our flip dollars for the year.
Lynn Moore: Yeah. I don't think we set an exact target number that specific, but we did talk about an expectation of being in the averaging 20 to 30 a quarter for the year, but not necessarily sequence or on a straight-line kind of a trajectory. So I think largely, we expect our expectations around flips for the year have not changed.
Joshua Reilly: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Reilly from Needham. Your line is open.
Joshua Reilly: Alright. Thanks for taking my question. If we look at the payment business, volumes were quite strong this quarter. How much of driver vehicle history record pulls maybe influenced that growth improvement? And is there any unusual transaction activity we should be considering in Q1? And do you expect the normal sequential increase in transaction volumes peaking in Q2 with historical trends? Thanks, guys.
Lynn Moore: Yeah. I think seasonally, there's not really any change in that normal pattern. Driver history records are kinda flat. So that really hasn't been a big driver in transaction. The strength was kinda evenly split between in terms of the increase over last year, between the state market. So our digital services, formerly NIC division, plus e-filing. So we've seen strength in e-filing. We've got some of the new services like the California Parks deal that wasn't there last year that's now contributing. We saw strong performance in Florida around our payments contract there as well as in Texas. And also, they had some digital titling service revenues come online. So all those have contributed to strength in the state payments market. In the local market, as we've called out, the new deals that we've added in recent quarters, as those come online, those are continuing to both deployments of new customers and added adoption with existing customers has contributed to strength there. And then there has been some impact that we expect to continue through the year from rate increases by third-party payment partners.
Saket Kalia: Your next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays. Your line is open.
Saket Kalia: Okay, great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question here. Brian, maybe for you, just given all the questions on SaaS bookings or SaaS new ARR. I was wondering if we could unpack that just a little bit. Then maybe the question is, how much if you had to estimate how much do you think was sort of pulled forward in Q4 roughly? And then is there a way to think about how much was maybe awarded this quarter but wasn't contracted, which maybe adds to some of that lumpiness? Does that make sense?
Brian Miller: Yeah. It does. I'd say, you know, it's hard to tell exactly just like it's hard to tell exactly how much deals or deal volume is directly attributed to ARPA, but I'd generally say it's probably in the $10 million range of bookings, give or take, that was pulled forward into last year's Q4. And the second part of the question, we really don't disclose awards that are not signed. But, you know, further to Lynn's comment, especially in the courts business, we have a number of those. And those indicators give us confidence that in certain areas of our business that were a little lighter in Q1 in terms of timing of bookings that we'll see those come back in Q2. I'd say, you know, on top of that too is there's business out there that whatever reason, we expected awards and contracts in Q1, and the award hasn't happened. So it's not just that we've had awards didn't get the contract, but we're also still waiting on some awards that we expected to happen in Q1.
Charles Strauzer: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Strauzer from CJS Securities. Your line is open.
Charles Strauzer: Hi, good morning. Just looking at the R&D line and the guidance this quarter versus the guidance that you gave initially the quarter. It seems to be another pretty good jump in the, you know, in R&D spend. Any more color you can shed on that?
Brian Miller: Yeah. We talked about some of the drivers when we gave our initial guidance around the increases in R&D. As we talked about earlier, there's a shift as we redeploy people out of cost of sales expense onto the R&D line. That's largely unchanged from our original expectation around $35 million of a shift there. We also have some cost development expense that we're resources that were devoted to capitalized projects last year that are now being expensed. And then really the change from our initial guidance to now is that we, which affects the GAAP R&D number, but not the non-GAAP R&D number, is that we now are recording the stock compensation expense associated with those R&D employees in R&D. And in the past, that was included in the G&A line. So that's a geography change. And, of course, it doesn't affect the non-GAAP number.
Rob Oliver: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Oliver from Baird. Your line is open.
Rob Oliver: Great. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it. Good morning. Could Lynn, just a two-part question for you. Just around some high-level trends. I guess, around ARPA. I just would be curious to hear from you. There is some chatter coming from DC, particularly around the Department of Education around attempts to claw back some of the ARPA funds that have been already allocated. And the Trump administration has made clear they wanna get some of that money back. And I just would be curious to hear I know you guys have some exposure to schools and what you're hearing there or hearing there generally. And is that the reason perhaps for some slightly slower contract activity? And then I just wanted to check on the federal side. For you guys on the BPM side. Just, you know, if you guys have done any audit of that business to understand how you guys sit relative to those? I know it's a very small percentage portion of your business going back to the 2019 acquisition. Just wanted to check the box that we're comfortable there. Thank you for both. Appreciate it.
Lynn Moore: Yeah. Thanks, Rob. We're not hearing anything from our clients that would suggest that anything that's been funded by ARPA would be clawed back. And, again, we can't always specifically identify whether a deal was funded specifically by ARPA. There are isolated incidents where we can. A lot of times, what have we talked about in the past? It was more freeing up also other resources. We did have one really small deal with the Department of Education that was in our federal space that was terminated. But, you know, that thing was maybe a $100,000 deal, give or take. So not really seeing anything there. I'm trying what was the second question? Yeah. Just broadly around our federal book of business. Yeah. So there, Rob, I mean, you know, we've seen, first of all, as you pointed out, federal is less than 5% of our revenue. We've had a handful, literally, four, five maybe five terminations in the federal space. All adding up to less than a million dollars. And you would was, you know, kind of the usual suspects, you know, would Department of Education. I just mentioned HHS. USAID. That doesn't come as much of a surprise. But, again, these were very small deals. We're watching another maybe million or so to see, but, again, pretty minimal. Which is also, you know, reflective of the size of the materiality to our business.
Jonathan Ho: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Line is open.
Jonathan Ho: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to better understand sort of your commentary around what's happened with some of the transaction fee increases and pass-throughs as well as the Texas contract. And maybe what your expectations are going forward? Thank you.
Brian Miller: Yeah. As you know, we have some we have a variety of payment streams around transactions. Or revenue streams around transactions and payments. And in some cases, we have existing relationships with third-party payment processors that basically we act as a reseller for. That we get a revenue share from. And to the extent that those third-party processors from time to time have rate increases or fee increases that in turn have flows through to our revenue share. They're somewhat unpredictable, and so we've we have seen a history in the last couple of years of those increasing, and we saw some of those increases that were a little above what our expectation was hit this quarter. And that'll flow through for the rest of the year. So that now built into our model. In terms of Texas, I guess two things. One, volume as with many of our payment processing volumes, Texas did have a little above our planned volumes this quarter. So that contributed to some of our transaction revenue outperformance. But as they work through their transition with our contract to the new provider, it appears that some of the timing of that will go beyond for some of the service we'll go beyond that August 30 or 31 contract deadline. So we do have an extension in place that provides a structure where if necessary, we can continue to provide some of those services during the transition period. So we'll see how that timing plays out. But some of those revenues could extend a little bit beyond August.
Lynn Moore: Yeah. Jonathan, just to follow-up on that, the extension was signed for August of year, but the expectation still is that Texas will move away by the end of the year. But most of the service is still winding down. Really through September and maybe some smaller ones continuing through December. Perhaps, you know, adding another $3 to $3.5 million of low-margin revenue, as you know, to our top line this year.
Gabriela Borges: Your next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges from Goldman Sachs.
Gabriela Borges: Lynn and Brian, your comments throughout the last forty-five minutes have been very consistent in saying the areas where you see an impact from DOGE or from deal scrutiny, all of those areas are very small. So my question for you is how do you think about the risk that some of these fringe issues on the margin become more mainstream as we go through the year? What would be a scenario where you see more of an impact as we go through the year, and how do you think about sizing that? Thank you.
Lynn Moore: Yeah, Gabriela. I mean, obviously, we talk about it. We keep an eye on it through, you know, regularly. We've been keeping an eye on it for the last several quarters. We see areas where there are, you know, potential. But at the same time, we're also in contact with our clients and the feedback we're getting from our clients is giving us the comfort to make the commentary we're making today. I'll give you one anecdotal piece, for example. One of our clients in Arizona who's talking about DOGE and the potential impacts of DOGE there, was talking about how that, you know, they may be required to cut some services, but what that's gonna do is require them to have more automation and, in fact, wanna buy more of our products. So, you know, right now, we're just watching it, but we're also in contact with our clients. And that's sort of the basis for our commentary today.
Alex Zukin: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Alex Zukin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess maybe just a two-parter for me. On new SaaS deals versus on-premise SaaS flips, is it should we assume that new SaaS deal ARR, versus last year is gonna be a little bit less around some of the pause and caution that you called or saw in Q1? And will conversions, the flips drive more of the SaaS growth this year than new SaaS deals? And then on kind of leading from that, if you look at the performance of SaaS, maybe help us just a little bit state the year on the SaaS revenue line, and what are the puts and takes to kind of hitting the low end versus the high end of your full-year guide on the SaaS revenue line?
Brian Miller: I'd say on the SaaS revenue guide, that, you know, current year sales don't have as big an impact on the current year revenue. Given the lag from the time we signed something to the time that we start to see that revenue stream hit the income statement, so the biggest driver around the variability of where we fall within that revenue guidance range is really around the flips, both the number of the flips and the timing of the flips. Which order they hit in, and how quickly we're able to start to see those revenue streams. We've talked about an expectation that the number of flips and the dollar value of flips will grow this year and continue to grow over the next couple of years. So that will be a bigger contributor to the SaaS bookings growth. But we do expect we don't give guidance on bookings, but I wouldn't say that we expect SaaS bookings for the year to be down. Last year was a very strong year for SaaS bookings. But as we said, the RFP level, the pipeline remains very solid, including with some larger deals in it. The last of quarters, we haven't seen those big deals, but they can be very lumpy. But I wouldn't necessarily expect SaaS bookings will actually be down for the year.
Keith Housum: Your next question comes from the line of Keith Housum from Northcoast Research. Your line is open.
Keith Housum: Good morning. Brian, I just wanna revisit the comment you made regarding the sales and marketing expenses being down. I think it was 2% to 4% year over year. Correct? Can you provide a little more color on that? And did they have a benefit in the first quarter? And what you guys are doing there?
Brian Miller: Yeah. We are expanding. We've talked about some of our expansion of sales resources. In terms of adding a dedicated state sales team that will be coming online this year. So there are some increases in expenses. We're being pretty thoughtful about how we spend some of our other sales and marketing dollars. But the biggest impact driving that reduction for the year is around commissions expenses. So under GAAP, certain commissions expenses, most commissions expenses are required to be capitalized and amortized over the period they benefit. Which for us is now a five-year period. And as we've restructured some of our sales compensation structure, and we've talked about the changes we've made generally in some of the sales compensation as we look to standardize across Tyler in an effort to further support cross-sell activities. So that has resulted in some sales compensation expense that was formerly expensed in the current period now being capitalized under GAAP. And so that change from last year is primarily responsible for that reduction in sales and marketing expense.
Operator: That concludes our question and answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Lynn Moore for closing remarks.
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Rob, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Brian Miller or myself. Everybody, have a great day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-13 10:00:00) =====

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, February 13, 2025. I would now like to turn the call over to Hala Elsherbini, Tyler's Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Hala Elsherbini: Thank you, Calvin, and welcome to our call. With me today is Lynn Moore, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. After I give the safe harbor statement, Lynn will have some initial comments on our quarter, and then Brian will review the details of our results and provide our annual guidance for 2025. Lynn will end with some additional comments, and then we'll take your questions. During this call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information and may include projections concerning the company's future results, future prospects, revenues, expenses, and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projections. We refer you to our Form 10-Ks and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Also, in our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings. We have also posted on the investor section of our website under the financials tab a schedule with supplemental information including information about quarterly recurring revenues and bookings. On the events and presentations tab, we've posted an earnings summary slide deck to supplement our prepared remarks. Please note that all loan comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise.
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Hala. Our fourth quarter results provided a solid finish to an exceptional year of growth and profitability as we executed on our key objectives across financial, operational, and strategic initiatives. We exceeded our expectations across our key financial metrics, with recurring revenue growth of nearly 15% driven by SaaS revenue growth of 23%, our sixteenth consecutive quarter of SaaS revenue growth of 20% or more. SaaS adoption continued to accelerate with both new and existing clients. With 97% of our new software contract value in the cloud, transaction revenues set a new quarterly high, growing nearly 21%. Our non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 24.4%, benefiting from the mix shift to higher SaaS revenues. In addition, free cash flow of $216 million significantly exceeded our expectations, reaching a new high for a fourth quarter. In 2023, we passed a cloud revenue inflection point where long-term recurring SaaS revenues surpassed on-premise license and maintenance revenues. At our 2023 Investor Day, we unveiled our Tyler 2030 vision and multiyear strategic direction, including drivers of revenue growth and margin expansion. We also laid out our 2025 and 2030 targets, key metrics around revenues, margins, and cash flow. We're pleased with our progress in 2024 toward those goals. As planned, we closed our Dallas data center midyear and are on track to close our main data center at the end of 2025. We delivered SaaS revenue growth that exceeded our 20% growth target, and transaction revenues were well above plan. We made significant progress with our cloud operations initiatives, delivering better than expected operating margin expansion through version consolidation, releasing cloud-optimized products. These proof points give us confidence in achieving our 2025 targets as well as our long-range goals of organic recurring revenue CAGR of 10% to 12%, sustainable margin expansion, with non-GAAP operating margins of 30% or more, and expanded free cash flow of $1 billion with free cash flow margins in the high 20s. The public sector market remains strong, with robust demand supported by healthy budgets, especially at the state and local levels, which comprise approximately 95% of our total revenue. The public sector's drive towards digital modernization continues to accelerate as aging mission-critical systems reach end of life, cybersecurity threats continue to increase, and governments at all levels face a growing demand for an improved citizen experience and seek operational efficiencies to enable them to do more with limited resources. While the new federal department of government efficiency or Doge is still in its early days, we don't envision its effort having a significant impact on funding or demand for our software and services, which power what are generally essential functions. In fact, we view an increased focus on government efficiency at any level as an opportunity rather than a risk for Tyler, and we believe that technology is ultimately the greatest driver of improved efficiency. The elevated market activity we've discussed for the past few quarters, along with excellent execution by our sales teams, is reflected in our new software bookings this quarter with new SaaS contract value of approximately $141 million, up 37% over last year. Our market-leading position and competitive strengths, including our deep domain expertise, broad portfolio solutions, and most importantly, our client base, serve as the foundation for our long-term strategic focus on four key growth pillars: executing on our cloud-first strategy, leveraging our unmatched installed base, expanding into new markets, and growing our differentiated payments business. Our cloud transition is anchored by our unifying principles toward a single release stream to better scale, innovate, and deliver an enhanced client experience. We've made significant progress with our cloud optimization efforts, with cloud-optimized releases launched across many of our flagship products, driving an accelerated pace of on-premise client migrations to the cloud, with more flips of larger clients taking place. For the quarter, we inked a total of 106 flips of on-premises clients. The total contract value from flips signed this quarter grew 58% over last year's fourth quarter, and the average ARR of flips signed in the quarter was nearly 32%. As we previously discussed, we are executing multiple cloud transitions across our product solutions, each with its own nuanced roadmap and timeline. We're pleased with the current trajectory of flips from on-premises to cloud deployments and currently envision flips peaking in 2027 and 2028 as we work towards migrating more than 80% of our on-premises clients to Tyler's next-generation cloud. We continue to lead with cloud across all product solutions, and during the quarter, we saw increased momentum from clients selecting multiple integrated solutions from Tyler. Our largest SaaS deal this quarter was an $11.4 million multi-suite contract with the city of Kenosha, Wisconsin, for enterprise ERP, enterprise permitting licensing, enterprise asset management, municipal justice, and enterprise assessment and tax solutions, which adds $1.3 million ARR, leveraged our expanding footprint and strong client references in Wisconsin, combined with our unique ability to offer multiple integrated solutions from a single platform. This is what we refer to as a total Tyler client engagement. Notable multiproduct SaaS contracts include Hernando County, Florida, and the city of Warner Robins, Georgia, for enterprise ERP, enterprise permitting licensing, and enterprise asset management solutions, adding almost $1.3 million in ARR. We're also pleased to see growing adoption of our AI-driven priority-based budgeting solution, which we acquired with ResourceX in the fall of 2023. Priority-based budgeting enables informed decision-making and efficiencies by linking financial resources to strategic funding priorities and goals. There were three key wins for the solution in Q4, with large clients, including LA County, California, Kansas City, Missouri, and Johnson County, Kansas, adding a total of nearly $1.8 million ARR. We're excited to partner with these clients as they implement their data-driven applications, leveraging our deep domain expertise and industry-leading best practices. We continue to drive higher cloud adoption for our public safety solutions, with both new competitive wins and a growing number of flips. Notable SaaS wins included the Southwest Regional Communications Center, a Texas 911 consortium in the Dallas Fort Worth area, and Peoria, Illinois, which dispatches for ten different agencies, each contracting for our full enterprise public safety suite. We also continue to build momentum at the state level with our public safety solutions. We signed three enterprise public safety deals with state agencies in the quarter, including SaaS contracts with the Iowa Department of Public Safety, which was a competitive effort leveraging our digital solutions division state enterprise relationship and contract vehicle, and also the Michigan State Police. We also signed a license deal with the Nebraska State Patrol. We now count nine state police agencies as enterprise public safety clients. In our state and federal business, we signed an eight-year contract with the state of Maine for a resident engagement portal, adding $2.2 million in ARR. This competitive win leveraged our strong state relationship as a trusted partner, offering deep public sector domain expertise and strong references from other successful implementations of our resident engagement platform. At the core of our growth strategy, leveraging our unmatched install base through cross-sell and upsell initiatives, we added to our growing footprint in outdoor recreation, signing a multi-year SaaS arrangement with the South Carolina State Parks under our state enterprise master agreement. Additionally, we signed a contract with the Colorado Department of Corrections for an inventory warehouse management solution, leveraging our Colorado State Enterprise relationship, to add $612,000 ARR. Driving transaction revenue growth through our integrated payments business is another key element of our growth strategy. Our payment strategy is centered on a high-value unified platform that seamlessly integrates with our software solutions and proprietary back-office services, creating opportunities for higher margins. Demand for our differentiated payment solutions continues to be strong, and in the fourth quarter, we signed 244 new payment deals across Tyler software clients, representing approximately $8.1 million in projected ARR. For the year, we signed 995 new payments deals. In our state enterprise business, we secured a two-year extension for our digital government and payment processing services with the state of Utah, representing approximately $11.5 million in ARR. Now I'd like to provide Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our annual guidance for 2025.
Brian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. Total revenues for the quarter were $541.1 million, up 12.5% and organically grew 12.4%. Subscriptions revenue increased 21.9% and organically rose 21.8%. Within subscription, SaaS revenues grew 23% to $173.4 million and grew organically 22.8%. Keep in mind that there's often a lag from the signing of a new SaaS deal or flip to the start of revenue recognition that can vary from one to several quarters. Because of this, as well as the timing of SaaS renewals and related price increases, SaaS revenue growth both year over year and sequentially may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Transaction revenues grew 20.9% to $175.4 million, driven by new transaction services, higher transaction volumes from both new and existing clients, including the August go-live of the California Department of Parks and Recreation, and e-filing growth. While Q4 is historically a seasonally lighter quarter for transaction-based revenues, we are seeing slightly less seasonality than in previous years, as we continue to diversify our mix of revenue, including digital titling services that are less seasonal, and outdoor recreation services that have different peak periods from state to state. As Lynn noted, we had a very good quarter for bookings in Q4, with a marginal benefit from field timing associated with the year-end deadline for allocating ARPA funds. SaaS deals comprised approximately 97% of our new software contract value, compared to 89% last year. During the quarter, we added 150 new SaaS arrangements and signed 106 best flips of existing on-premises clients, with a total contract value of approximately $194 million, up 42%. In Q4 of last year, we added 156 new SaaS arrangements and had 92 flips with a total contract value of approximately $137 million. The average ARR from new SaaS contracts increased 63%. The average ARR associated with our Q4 flips increased 32% over last year, as we continue to see larger clients flip to the cloud. Our total annualized recurring revenue was approximately $1.86 billion, up 14.9%. We entered 2024 expecting margin expansion operating margin. After experiencing the margin trough from our cloud transition in 2023, and we have exceeded our expectations. Our non-GAAP operating margin in the fourth quarter was 24.4%, up 210 basis points from last year. The margin expansion reflects the impact of our cloud efficiency initiatives along with effective operating expense management. As we discussed on previous calls, merchant and interchange fees from our payments business under the gross revenue model have a meaningful impact on our overall margins as they are included in both revenues and cost of revenues. We incurred merchant fees of approximately $41 million in Q4, compared to $35 million last year. Because of strong earnings and effective working capital management, both cash flows from operations and free cash flow reached new highs for our fourth quarter at $224.8 million and $216 million respectively, with free cash flow up 60.7%. Cash flow in the quarter was positively impacted by two significant items. The first was a $29 million prepayment in October of six years of SaaS fees related to our new enterprise justice contract with the state of Kentucky. The second was the timing of funds that we routinely collect and disperse through Tyler disbursement platform, formerly Rapid. At year-end, approximately $25 million of cash was held by Tyler that was subsequently dispersed under these contracts. We ended the quarter with $600 million of convertible debt outstanding and cash and investments of approximately $779 million, and net leverage is zero. Now I'd like to turn to our annual guidance for 2025. We expect total revenues will be between $2.30 billion and $2.34 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 8.5%. We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be between $7.31 and $7.56 and may vary significantly due to the impact of discrete tax items on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $10.90 and $11.15. Our estimated non-GAAP tax rate for 2025 is expected to be 22.5%. We expect our free cash flow margin will be between 24% and 26%, including an estimated impact of approximately $27 million of incremental cash taxes related to section 174. We expect research and development expense will be in the range of $177 million to $182 million. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release and in the Q4 earnings deck posted on our website. I'd like to add some additional color around our guidance. Subscription revenues in total are expected to grow between 15% and 18%, and within subscriptions, SaaS revenue is expected to grow between 21% and 24%. Transaction revenues are expected to grow between 10% and 12%, with merchant fees down 7% to 9%. Our expected transactions growth is below the 2024 growth rate and will be impacted by the wind-down of our payments processing contract with the state of Texas, which currently expires at the end of August 2025, and was awarded to another payment vendor after a competitive procurement process. The Texas contract is a standalone, somewhat commoditized payments arrangement and differs in a number of respects from our core payment strategy, which is centered on providing differentiated payment solutions integrated with our software solutions, enterprise portals, and proprietary back-office services that add value to our clients and provide opportunities for premium pricing. For background, the payment relationship with Texas was not an organically developed relationship but was part of a state enterprise agreement that NIC purchased from BearingPoint following their bankruptcy in 2009. That contract was split in 2017, with NIC retaining the payment services, and it was subsequently extended through August of 2025. We knew that the rebid would be highly competitive and price-sensitive, and margins under the existing contract were already very low. There were no issues with the quality of our services, and we believe that price was the significant factor in the award. The Texas payments contract is a gross contract with 2024 revenues of approximately $44 million, merchant fees of approximately $39 million, and a gross margin of approximately 10%. We currently expect that 2025 revenues from Texas payments will be approximately $29 million at a similar gross margin. While we expect to continue to provide payment services to Texas through August, it is possible that some services may transition prior to then. Excluding emergencies that are absorbed under the gross revenue model, expected transactions growth in 2025 would be approximately 17%, and total growth would be approximately 10%. Given the narrow margins of the gross model Texas contract, we will see a positive impact on margins as these services end. Maintenance revenue is expected to decline 4% to 6%, reflecting the ongoing shift in our new software business mix to SaaS, as well as the acceleration of flips in 2024 and 2025. Professional services revenue is expected to be flat to down 3% as our cloud transition drives efficiencies in implementations and allows us to limit the growth of these lower-margin revenues. License revenues are expected to decline 18% to 20% with very few license sales to new clients. Hardware and other is also expected to decline 18% to 20% as 2024 benefited from elevated hardware sales tied to the use of ARPA funds. Research and development expenses are expected to grow more than 50% due to three main factors: The first, representing approximately 30 percentage points of the growth, is a redeployment to R&D of development resources previously focused on support activities and expense and cost of revenues. As we continue to transition to a SaaS-only model, this redeployment will continue over the next few years as product lines complete their transition to SaaS-only. Secondly, certain capitalized software development projects either concluded in 2024 or will conclude in 2025, resulting in more development costs being expensed and accounting for approximately eight percentage points of the R&D growth. The remaining growth represents our incremental funding of R&D initiatives, including investments in AI. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn.
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. 2024 was another successful year in advancing our cloud-first strategy. We delivered growth and consistent operating margin improvement, tracking towards our 2030 objectives. Our sales organization continues to execute at a very high level, which was reflected in our bookings growth. Our unified go-to-market strategy is creating substantial expansion opportunities with both new and existing clients. Our inside sales team has performed exceptionally well, representing a high-growth sales channel. We're investing across our sales channels and adding additional sales resources, including a new dedicated state sales team that will be in place this year. We've also aligned incentive compensation and commissions across Tyler in a way that has reduced barriers and facilitated more cross-sell. We take very seriously our responsibility to be good stewards of the capital that our shareholders entrust us, which we have exhibited through our long history of disciplined financial management and prudent capital allocation. That continued to be the case in 2024. In a high-interest rate environment, we fortified our balance sheet by paying off the remaining term debt associated with the NIC acquisition, reducing our net leverage to zero at year-end. Additionally, we enhanced our financial flexibility by replacing our $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a new facility extending maturity to 2029, increasing the size to $700 million with improving terms. Our disciplined acquisition strategy focuses on opportunities that complement our existing portfolio, expand our addressable market, and add technologies that can be leveraged across our product portfolio. We remain patient acquirers and are well-positioned to continue to make tuck-in acquisitions while maintaining the flexibility to pursue compelling larger opportunities. But we did not make any acquisitions in 2024. I want to highlight our recent acquisition of MyGov, closed January 31st. MyGov is a leading provider of integrated community development and asset management solutions to small and mid-sized municipalities and currently serves approximately 150 clients, with a high concentration in Texas. MyGov strengthens our public administration offering and expands our local market footprint with an integrated platform that complements our extensive enterprise portfolio. We're thrilled to welcome the MyGov team and clients to Tyler. AI continues to garner significant attention in the software space, and interest in AI from the public sector is growing. Building on our momentum and commitment to innovation, we are taking a deliberate and strategic approach to our AI strategy centered on three core pillars: productivity, decision-making, and service delivery. We're separating the hype from reality by leveraging our unmatched strengths of decades of public sector experience, 13,000 clients producing critical data every day, and deep collaboration with leading AI vendors like AWS, Microsoft, and Google. We expect that by the end of this year, every flagship product roadmap will have clear AI-driven features, and we plan to preview our AI strategy to clients at our Tyler Connect user conference in May, demonstrating our commitment to innovation and empowering clients with dramatically enhanced productivity and performance. I'd like to highlight some recently announced additions and changes to our senior leadership team that support our commitment to long-term growth and leadership development. As we enter the next phase of our cloud-first transition, we took a significant strategic step toward further enhancing our client experience with the creation at the end of 2024 of a new chief client officer role. Our appointment of industry leader Andrew Call to that position is critical to strengthening our long-term client relationships, maximizing the value of our installed base, and driving expansion through cross-sell and upsell opportunities. Andrew will oversee our client-centric approach across Tyler's vast public sector client base. He brings extensive technology leadership experience, having served as CEO of Backbox Software, the global category leader in the network security automation market, where he led cloud transformation and business model evolution. In his previous positions, he held multiple client success roles and served as chief customer officer at SailPoint, overseeing global customer success and partner enablement. Andrew's deep technology background and track record of driving innovation and client engagement positions us well for success as we scale our cloud initiatives and create a single unified experience for clients with multiple Tyler products. Our chief marketing officer, Samantha Crosby, has announced her intent to retire this June. In her 16 years with Tyler, Samantha's visionary leadership in developing our unified brand strategy and her contributions across marketing and communications have been instrumental in our growth and success. Until June, we will continue to tap into Samantha's immense experience during her transitional senior marketing adviser role, and we extend our heartfelt appreciation to Samantha for her dedicated service. In January, we named Eric Flanders as chief marketing officer, succeeding Samantha. Since joining Tyler's marketing team in 2023, Eric has significantly enhanced our digital marketing operations, technology and data practices, and demand generation strategies. Prior to joining Tyler, Eric gained extensive experience as an innovative leader in progressively responsible global marketing management roles with Texas Instruments. Abby Diaz, previously our chief legal officer, has been elevated to the newly created position of chief administrative officer. In this expanded role, she will continue to oversee our legal team, adding responsibilities for internal audit, data privacy, corporate governance and responsibility, and corporate communication. This transition strengthens alignment across these critical functions and fosters an integrated approach to governance, compliance, and communications. Associate general counsel, Bill Van Essel, has been promoted to chief legal officer and assumes direct leadership of the legal team. Bill joined Tyler in 2021 through the acquisition of NIC, where he served as general counsel. Lastly, I'm pleased to highlight that Tyler has recently been recognized by multiple leading publications for our commitment to excellence, innovation, and workplace culture, including Forbes' American Dream Employers and Best Large Employers 2025 list. In December, we were named AWS State or Local Government Partner of the Year, and most recently, we were named to the 2025 GovTech 100 list for the ninth consecutive year. As we enter 2025, I'd like to repeat what I said to our Tyler team in our recent town hall: that I'm not just excited about Tyler's future, but I've never been more confident in our future. We're experiencing success in growing our high-value SaaS and differentiated transaction revenues while reducing the mix of lower-margin revenues like professional services and commodity payments. As our 2025 guidance illustrates, we're well on track to meet or exceed the 2025 targets we communicated at our 2023 Investor Day, and we remain confident in realizing our Tyler 2030 vision. I look forward to reporting on our progress during the coming year. Now I'd like to open up the line for Q&A.
Operator: We'll now begin the question and answer session. To answer a question into the question queue, if you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset and press the star key and the number one. To withdraw your request, press the star key and the number one. As a reminder, please limit your question to one question so we may have more time for progress. We will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. Your first question comes from the line of Alexei Gogolev, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Alexei Gogolev: Good morning, everyone, and congratulations on the amazing results. Lynn, could I first start with your payment comments and comments that Brian made? It's clearly appears that you're prioritizing profitability within payments. As you mentioned, you're moving away from commoditized products. Could you perhaps elaborate on the announcements made by Fiserv at their recent earnings call around the expansion of their payments partnership with Tyler? What does that imply longer term for your partnerships with other third parties? And do you think that expansion of the Fiserv partnership could benefit your margin outlook?
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Alexei. So that was there's a lot in there. I'm gonna I'll try to hit all the points. If not, I'm sure Brian or someone else will catch up. I think our strategy at Tyler has always been to not really pursue commodity payments. And I think when you look back, you know, pre-Tyler's acquisition of NIC, I think the viewpoint there was more sort of any payments deal was a good deal, and that's not really what we're pursuing. We don't really want to pursue those pure payment contracts. It's commoditized pricing. It's low margin. It's not sticky. They come up for rebid. It's a race to the bottom. We want to be there where we have a differentiated offering that we connect to our back-office systems, that we do reporting, that we can drive higher margins and drive higher revenue. So I think that's sort of been where we've been the last couple of years, and I don't think that's changed. As Brian mentioned in the comments, we inherited the contract. We were happy to have the Texas contract. It showed it was showed our relationship with Texas. It showed our ability to do payment processing. But again, there was no additional add-on or stickiness that we were bringing with that. As it relates to Fiserv, Fiserv is one of our larger payment processors. They had a long-standing relationship with NIC prior to our acquisition. They primarily or exclusively right now serve our payment processing in the state market within NIC. What Fiserv does is they provide a lot of technology, and I think that's really what you're seeing from that relationship is it's an opportunity for us to really tap into some of the technology that they deliver. As of right now, it does not impact our other payment processing vendors. We use a handful of other ones. But it's sort of when I look at payment processing, I almost think back about how we were when we made our decision to go to the cloud and AWS and really to exit our data centers. When you think about things we used to talk about, you know, Tyler running its own data sets. We're not in the data center business. And we're not really in the payment processing business. And we're not going to invest in some of the technology around there the way that some of the core payment processors do. I mean, we have some of that, and we do invest, but I think going forward, being able to leverage broader technology and capabilities that can help our client base around things like enhanced fraud protection and cryptocurrency and things like that. So, you know, we're looking to deepen our relationships with payment processing providers so that we can leverage the things that they're really good at and we can leverage the things that we're good at. I mean, it's I think part of your question was which will ultimately drive higher margins for Tyler.
Alexei Gogolev: Appreciate it, Lynn. And speaking about the increases in investments, based on what Brian suggested, and what you said, you're clearly investing in AI. So all that portion that is incremental this year. Looking forward to seeing those products at the main conference. How much of that is coming from AWS, which I'm assuming is probably your main partner that you're collaborating with? And are there any joint investments that you're doing or joint products that you're hoping to introduce?
Lynn Moore: Well, that's a good question. We obviously partner with AWS on a lot of things. Yes, they are helping us with roadmaps on not just AI, but just even other things with respect to our cloud initiative. We do have a number of investments in our 2025 plan around that AI. Those are both new headcount, but also repurposing of our existing headcount. Again, as I mentioned in my remarks, we're going to have all of our major applications will have some sort of AI component and feature, and we're gonna unveil some of those or a lot of those at Connect this spring.
Alexei Gogolev: Appreciate it, Lynn. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Reilly of Needham and Company. Please go ahead.
Joshua Reilly: Great. Thanks for taking my question. If we look at the guidance of down 4% to 6% on maintenance revenue, clearly, you have some line of sight around migrations to kind of provide this revenue guidance sits down a little bit more this year. Can you help us understand the level of visibility you have right now on migrations for the year to provide that guidance? And are these migrations broad-based, or is there a particular product line that's accelerating the migration?
Brian Miller: Yeah. I think the migrations are generally pretty broad-based. Each product has a different sort of roadmap and timeline for its customer base, and as we get further down the road, we generally have more visibility over that. I'd say public safety is certainly an area where we've seen a pretty rapid increase in the desire to be in the cloud, both from new customers and existing on-premises customers. So I guess on a percentage basis, you're probably seeing more of an increase in the public safety. That flips the it's really across all customers and or all product lines, and we've said that right now, we still sort of envision a bell-shaped curve over the next several years as we move towards those long-term targets. We think 2027 and 2028 will probably be those peak years. But we'll continue to see a higher level of flips in 2025 than we did in 2024, and that will continue on through 2026, 2027, 2028. So we have decent visibility. Sometimes we're engaged with large numbers of our customers around the process of flipping. We've talked in the past about some of the things like cybersecurity attacks, ransomware attacks, their challenges in running their own internal networks and data centers, the replacement of hardware, all those things as factors that drive them to want to flip to the cloud. As well as our continued move to the cloud and focus there, the release of new features that are sometimes only available in the cloud. So all those things are contributing to that increased momentum towards flips. You know, we have a range, so sometimes the timing of when those flips actually sign and then that, like, from when they sign to when they're actually live is a factor in where we perform in that range, but I'd say we have pretty decent visibility over that.
Joshua Reilly: Awesome. Thank you. I'll leave it to one question.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Wong of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Ken Wong: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Brian, I wanted to ask about cash flows, you know, recognizing that this was a particularly strong cash flow year, which, you know, kind of creates the tougher comp into 2025. But as we kind of map out our models going forward, I mean, should we assume that some of the strength this year is gonna be a drag into future out years, or just trying to get a sense for kind of how we should kind of when we should start to kind of ramp up the cash flow growth?
Brian Miller: Yeah. We called out the two items that totaled around $55 million of incremental cash flow in the fourth quarter, that the Kentucky prepayment, which we talked about last quarter. That's a very unusual sort of an item where with the six-year prepayment. And then that so the timing of the float around some of the client money that flows through us for disbursements. That is a recurring item, but it was unusually high from some new customers at the end of right at the end of December, so that incremental, you know, $25 million or so kind of gave us a boost. But, you know, if it had happened two days later, it would have been in next year's cash flow. So sort of if you take those two items and sort of set them aside, our normalized what I'd sort of call it normalized cash flow margin would have been 24.3% for 2024, which is still above, you know, what we had targeted and what our guidance was at the beginning of the year. And so that would imply, you know, it's a midpoint of our guidance for 2025. That would imply another 100 basis points of margin expansion, free cash flow margin expansion in 2025. So some of the stuff has been pulled forward. We're seeing certainly some of the margin benefits sooner. But I think we'll continue to progress towards those 2030 targets that we talked about, you know, high 20s, 30% sort of range of free cash flow margin. So we're getting there a little faster, but I think we still have an upward trajectory and sort of normalized that still implies some expansion next year.
Ken Wong: Got it. Thanks, Brian.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne. Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Dylan: Hi. This is Dylan for Kirk, and thank you for taking my question. The prepared commentary mentioned strong cross-sell momentum.
Lynn Moore: Yeah. No. I think I don't know that I would say anything specific. It's really across all of our product lines. You know, some of the things that we've done in the last couple of years around I mentioned in the prepared remarks around sales comp and incentives. Other things we one internal one Tyler initiative we've done have really been fueling this, but look, our sales teams have are just really knocking it out of the park. Last year was a really great sales year. Generally speaking, if you look across Tyler as a whole, we generally either add or exceeded, you know, our quotas for the year, which is really encouraging. What's exciting about me, I mentioned in my remarks about being excited for the future, not only is it how we're performing against the metrics that we set out in investor day. We're also now, you know, able to make some more investments into Tyler that are gonna keep fueling that growth without sacrificing margins. You know, we are making some additional investment of the change there. But we're making some investments in our sales teams. We're making investments across our inside sales teams. I mentioned the creation of a new state sales team. We've done things and looked at territories and quotas. So there's a lot of stuff going on right now that's exciting, but it's really across the board of Tyler.
Dylan: Great. Thanks for taking my question.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia, Barclays. Please go ahead.
Saket Kalia: Okay. Great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question here. Lynn, maybe for you, I just wanted to flush out the question on those just a little bit more. You know, federal is clearly a small part of Tyler's business. I mean, I think you said it's probably 5% or less. Right? But I was wondering if you could speak to just roughly how much of an average state or local government budget comes from federal funding versus other sources like real estate taxes. And I know you spend a lot of time with customers. As you speak to customers, what are they saying about Doge, if anything, as they think about investing in tools like Tyler?
Lynn Moore: Yeah. It's a good question. I don't know that I have the Brian, you have that number?
Brian Miller: Yeah. I've got some sort of high-level averages on where government revenues come from, and at the local level, there's very, very little federal funding. There can be some grants around specific things. And generally, on a national average at the local level, about 14% of their revenues come from state funding, which can include some trickle-down from federal, but almost half of their revenues are from local taxes and another 17% from general charges like licenses and those sorts of things. So very, very little funding at the local level from federal revenues. And at the county level, there's roughly a quarter of their budgets tend to come from state funding, which again can include some trickle-down from federal. But again, at the county level, mostly, you know, 40% or more from local taxes. So not a whole lot that gets down to the local level, which is the vast majority of our revenues.
Lynn Moore: Yeah. I'd say I'd just echo the comments I made in the opening remarks, which I view it and I think Tyler views it as really an opportunity, not a risk. There's a big splash going on out there right now. But the crux of that is how do we make government more efficient? How do we make sure we're not wasting dollars? You look at I mentioned this priority-based budgeting deal. Deals we did in Q4 with the city of LA. That's what that solution is all about. You know, we signed a $1.2 million ARR deal with the city of LA for that offering. So to me, you know, I'm not hearing from our clients that that's going to create a pause in spending. What I believe it's going to do is create more partnership opportunities and then looking for us to help to continue to help them find ways to be more efficient, which is really our been our business model for, you know, since I've been at Tyler 26 and a half years. So I don't see that as any as a headwind. I see it as an opportunity going forward.
Saket Kalia: That makes a ton of sense. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin of Wolfe. Please go ahead.
Alex Zukin: Hey, guys. Congrats on another great quarter. Maybe, Lynn, just first for you. Can you just maybe you touched on this in the prepared remarks, but maybe go a little bit deeper on just the quality of the demand environment, the pipeline going into this year, because it seems like, again, specifically on the SaaS line, it continues to outperform your expectation. I think you're even now guiding to an acceleration for next year. So what's been driving this faster than expected or faster than you anticipated conversion story? And how does AI play into this mix of maybe, you know, in addition to the cyber threats that have accelerated some of these migrations, actually also layering on top of that as a driver for the increased velocity of those conversions?
Lynn Moore: Yeah. There's a lot there. Our, you know, I just say generally, and we've been saying this for some time, which is really budgets are healthy and stable. Leading indicators are all steady. Our competitors remain strong. Just touched on it a couple of questions ago. Our sales team continues to execute at a really, really high level. And the more that we are getting better at our story of OneTyler and cross-selling and divisions helping other divisions sell and move product, it gains its own momentum. Then you're seeing things in the acceleration of SaaS we've talked about, public safety and the acceleration there. We often talk about how our clients, you know, they don't compete with each other. In fact, they share information with each other, and one of the things we've always been really, really good at is getting clients up and live in how we deal with our clients, whether it's a flip or a new client. And the more that our clients see us perform that and the efficiencies that start coming to the client, the more that they talk, then the more demand it creates for us and our services. So to me, it's a bit of a mini flywheel where we just continue we're building on our own momentum. But also, look, it starts with our people. It starts with really excellent sales execution. And it's excellent execution from our implementation people, from our services, from our support up and down the board. It's the stuff we don't spend enough time talking about it, but it's the stuff that really makes Tyler go. And I couldn't be more proud of our people for driving that kind of success.
Brian Miller: And I'd just add that at this point, I don't think AI is really a big driver of either flips or new business. I think most things. Government doesn't want to be the first adopters, but a lot of our clients are very curious and want to know more about AI. They're looking for us in many cases to help show them the way that AI can increase productivity and make them more efficient. And as Lynn said, we'll be talking about that at our user conference coming up in May and making investments there. We have a story in each of our major products. But at this point, I don't think it's a significant factor in that cloud acceleration, but down the road, it'll certainly be another area that provides us competitive advantage.
Alex Zukin: Excellent. And then, Brian, maybe on the R&D investment side. We've never necessarily covered the company. I think I've been waiting for that to come out of the cost of goods line and make its way onto the R&D line. Maybe just dive a little deeper on the trajectory that you see as the maintenance stream continues to kind of, you know, as those conversions pick up, how should we think about that R&D line even maybe beyond just this year taking on a different shape over the course of the next few years?
Brian Miller: Yeah. You know, there's talk about roughly, there's $100 million of development expense that's in cost of sales. This year, about $35 million we believe will be redeployed to the R&D line, and that's really tied to as individual products and development teams reach certain points where they're more cloud-focused and less focused on support and development around existing on-prem products. So that'll take place over the next several years, the balance of that or a big part of the balance of that $100 million moving and being redeployed to the R&D line. I'm not sure exactly how that trajectory will play out, but we just we'll see that over the next few years. But probably more front-end loaded over the next let's call it three to four years.
Lynn Moore: And, Alex, to be clear as well, while the bulk of this is cost of sales, we are adding R&D people. I mentioned it earlier. We are making some investments in AI. We are making some other competitive investments across some of our core applications. So it's not just a shift that we are also increasing our investment in R&D.
Alex Zukin: Perfect.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Michael Turrin: Hey, thanks. Greg, good morning. I appreciate you taking the question. The commentary throughout the call, the Q4 results show an uptick in SaaS momentum, some of the growth metrics. The initial 2025 guide for overall growth, Brian, of 8.5% doesn't at least appear to fully capture some of that momentum. So maybe just speak a bit more to the mix of what you're seeing across segments, how that impacts total growth, and is there any change to the guidance approach you're embedding for 2025 here at all. Thank you.
Brian Miller: There's not really a change to the approach. You know, one thing we point out is and then we did give a little bit more information around the ranges of growth expected for each of the major categories, and clearly, the growth is more on the high-value and higher-margin revenues. So, you know, SaaS revenues that range up 21% to 24%, which is kind of consistent with what we've seen in terms of bookings growth this year in kind of that low 20s. And so as that turns into revenues as the deals get implemented and those customers go live, the flips take place. That kind of mirrors the kind of growth we've seen in bookings. Transactions, up 10% to 12%, that does encompass the roughly $10 million decline from the wind-down of the Texas agreement. So excluding that, our transactions growth would be more up in the mid to upper teens. Maintenance is going down as we expected with the flips, and professional services is going down slightly, which is a good thing given that the margins around professional services and our ability to be more efficient around. So I'd say that the philosophy around our guidance is really not changed, and, you know, we give a range that encompasses what we believe are the various risks and opportunities embedded in there, and we would expect to fall within that range.
Lynn Moore: And, Michael, I'd add and sorry, Alex. I think I called you Mike on the last question. I apologize for that. Just echo what Brian said. Look, our quality revenue lines are actually the ones that are gonna drive our growth. Those are the ones we focused on investor day. SaaS and transactions. There is a little bit of there is some noise in this year's financials from the Texas payments. That's actually gonna show up a little bit like last year. If you pull out those merchant fees, we're growing at our 10% target, which is good. But again, if you look at the metrics that we shared, the things to focus on at investor day, they're tracking either at or above where we said they'd be two years ago. And that's all extremely encouraging.
Michael Turrin: That's all very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Strauzer of CJS Securities Incorporated. Please go ahead.
Charles Strauzer: Hi. Good morning. Prime ABCU. Maybe initially shed some light on the abnormally high stock comp implied in the guidance.
Brian Miller: Yeah. It looks like the stock comp, it goes up a bit next year, mostly related to expectation, you know, the higher level, higher stock price that we're going into the year with relative to where we were last year as the stock grows through the year. But generally, the dilution that we're going to see from the from new issues of stock compensation is pretty modest. There is an impact from the convert in the dilution, but stock comp should be really mostly related to just a higher stock price.
Lynn Moore: Yeah. So Charlie, if you look at this year versus last year, I think our plan that we're gonna probably experience somewhere around 28 to 30 cents of dilution year over year. That's a combination of we obviously had a nice run on the stock last year. A number of option exercises. That will now have the full weight of the year plus the full value to convert. You step back and look at our compensation plans and how we do things with Tyler, you'll recall that in 2022, we stopped issuing options and went to purely share-based, mostly performance-based, and some are issued on an annual basis, the number of shares that will be approved that were approved by the board and that will be issued here. Less than on a net share issuance, less than four-tenths of one percent of our outstanding. So it's something I watch carefully every year. I think from a technology company perspective, our dilution is pretty modest. And I would expect that to continue going forward.
Charles Strauzer: Great. Thanks for the clarification.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Clarke Jeffries of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Clarke Jeffries: Hello. Thank you for taking the question. You know, Brian, Lynn, I'm reflecting on the initial free cash flow guide you had for 2025 at the Analyst Day that was a midpoint of 18%. And I think, you know, since here less than two years later, we're over 700 basis points higher than that original estimate. And so I guess I wanted to ask the question, you know, reflecting on that. What has been the most significant outperformance? And with some of these items that still seem like margin tailwinds that are pretty controllable here over the next few years, you know, reduction of commodity payments, maybe scaling some of those R&D costs that might be accelerating in 2025, and then the data center closure. You know, why aren't long-term margins going higher in your mind as we get to, you know, the later part of those long-term targets for 2030?
Lynn Moore: Well, Clarke, I think that's a fair question. And I would say that we're I'll repeat what I said earlier. I'm really confident in Tyler's future. And, you know, we set four targets two years ago. We've kept our eye on the ball. We have outperformed those targets, as you mentioned, both from a SaaS growth perspective and even transactions, but also from a margin perspective, and we're starting to see those. I'm not sitting here today ready to adjust our 2030 targets. I'm just I'm really happy with where we sit here in 2025. As I told the management team, we have to hit our 2025 targets, and we're doing that, and again, the entire management team is focused on it. We will, you know, when we look up two years from now, three years from now, and maybe adjust those, we might. I don't want to get ahead of our skis. You know, we still have a lot of initiatives going on within Tyler. Again, I'm excited about all the signs that we're seeing out there, some of the things that you pointed to. But I'm not ready to declare that victory on our 2030 Investor Day. Now it's time to up the ante. We just want to keep executing and moving forward.
Brian Miller: And I think cash flow, as you point out, we are well ahead of the targets that we originally set out for 2025. I think we've had some assumptions there around things like cash taxes, working capital. I mean, we've been very effective about managing those. We've had effective management of receivables that have given us an impact sooner. And then clearly, the fact we're also ahead on margins and that flows through the cash flow. So a lot of that is a pull ahead, but as Lynn said, that makes us, you know, highly confident of those longer-term targets as well. And, you know, as we move down the road, we'll look at adjusting those if that's appropriate.
Clarke Jeffries: Thank you very much. And absolutely. I mean, the last two years is a very encouraging result. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Oliver from Baird. Please go ahead.
Rob Oliver: Great. Thanks. Good morning, Lynn and Brian. My question is around the cloud-optimized products. Appreciate that you guys have been very methodical about laying out milestones for the street and hitting those milestones, and a lot is going on behind the scenes. I was wondering if you could update us on you mentioned you'd made progress in 2024. If you could update us on where we are with the cloud optimization of your products and what sort of milestones we should be looking for as the investment community over the next couple of years to get fully cloud optimized. Thank you.
Lynn Moore: Yeah. I don't know that I'm ready to put out a specific metric. All I can tell you is sitting here today in 2025 in February 2025, I'm really pleased with where we are in our cloud transition, which includes the optimization of our products. There's still more room to go. I'm really pleased with where we are on version consolidation. If you would have told me three years ago that some of our core applications, for example, our enterprise ERP application, you know, over 95, 97 of our clients run a single version. Enterprise Justice, you know, I think we're north of 75 on a single version. These are things that were big moves, and I wasn't quite sure when we would get there. And to me, we're ahead of schedule. And all of that starts to feed into each other. We're gonna continue to make optimizations to the cloud, but we're also gonna continue our efficiencies in how we deliver the software as we continue to evolve into a more continuous improvement, continuous delivery. That's going to take time. But that is part of our goals. And I think as you look out to, you know, the later part of this decade, those are big milestones is when we really start moving down into synchronized cadence releases across our client base, across our major products. And we're making progress towards those goals.
Rob Oliver: Great. Thanks, Lynn. Appreciate it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho of William Blair. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Ho: Hi. Good morning, and congrats on the strong results. Is there a way for us to think about the impact that ARPA funding has had? And going forward, is there potentially any impact to agency spending confidence as this starts to wind down? Thank you.
Lynn Moore: You know, we've talked about a lot over the last couple of years, Jonathan. ARPA funding has been around and in the background. It hasn't necessarily specifically driven a lot of deals. Although, I will say, that we got a few SaaS deals signed at the end of the quarter. Were on a shorter time fuse. We were going to win those deals anyway. Those were probably gonna be Q1 deals that got a little bit accelerated because there was some ARPA funding. You saw it we talked about it some last year in our hardware business school transportation business. One reason why our hardware line is going down this year, again, a low margin low margin line. I think generally, you know, I would more point to my comments of the general environment and the general health of the state and budget psych budget and local budgets, excuse me, and where we sit today and our competitiveness. I think it's been there. I don't if you're if you're I think part of your question is is it now is it a headwind going forward? I don't I don't believe it is. And there's still even even places where there are ARPA funds allocated, I believe there's still time for them to spend those. They had to earmark them. But again, I don't I've never viewed that as a as a material part of Tyler's performance over the last four to five years. It's there on the edges. And so therefore, I also don't view it as a headwind going forward. And doesn't change my confidence in our near-term or long-term sales projections.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Terry Tillman of Truist Security. Please go ahead.
Terry Tillman: Yeah. Thanks for fitting me in here, Lynn, Brian, and Hala. It is a single question, but it's got a little bit of multiple tentacles to it. You know, all this narrative around Doge, what about some of that actually trickling down to some of these estates that we're hearing about? Maybe them thinking about efficiency incrementally and digitizing things. Are you hearing about anecdotally some increased conversations because of maybe this trickling down? And then the second part of this is you look at 2025 and just based on what you're seeing in terms of the pipeline, do you see any meaningful shift between just the composition of your business from local government versus state level? Thank you.
Lynn Moore: I would say, next to the Doge question, no. We're not really hearing anything yet. And it's I don't really expect it to do anything other than to maybe spur more conversation around technology that can help them become more efficient. Those are still relatively new. Although, it was talked about before the new administration actually took over. But it's still relatively new. And our clients, at least that I know of, are not talking about it. I think if you look generally in 2025 and beyond, how we look at sales, I think it's still pretty consistent across the board, but I would go back to my comment in the prepared remarks. Look, we are in the midst of creating a new dedicated state sales team. It's something new to Tyler. It's going to be it's something I'm excited about. So, you know, I think we will start to see more product go in, but part of the mission of that sales team is really about representing the entire Tyler portfolio where it's our Cox solutions, our payments, our application platform, it's gonna be geared at not only where we have state enterprise contracts, but also looking at new states. Looking beyond our state enterprise contracts. Look, it's gonna take time for that to ramp up. I don't necessarily expect significant variance, but it's just another sales avenue that we're teeing up and investing in starting in 2025 that will take, you know, time to see meaningful results.
Terry Tillman: Thanks, Lynn.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schappel with Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Mark Schappel: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Lynn, I just want to ask about your priority-based budgeting solution. Appears to be off to a really strong start given the wins in the quarter. I was wondering if you could just provide an example or two of some public sector use cases that you're seeing your customers adopt around ResourceX?
Lynn Moore: Yeah. You know, what it does is it's a little bit different than, you know, sort of traditional line item budgeting, and it sort of looks it uses AI, it looks at the cost of all the programs that are out there, kind of lines budgets and programs and scores to those that, you know, really they look at an organization's priorities and sort of reshift dollars. It's relatively new. One of the things that we were excited about when we bought it is Chris Fabian, the founder, he's sort of known as the the leader, really, the leader in public sector around priority-based budgeting. And he is the expert in it's something that I think we can take and transport across our client base, you know, it's I think it's another example when our perfect tuck-in acquisitions and when we see large organizations like LA County or Kansas City taking this solution, it's pretty meaningful. We're able to do demos and fairly quickly show where organizations can achieve some real savings. There's been a lot of talk around those today. I can't think of a solution that we have that would be more in line with Doge than our priority-based budgeting solution.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Gabriela Borges: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to ask the Texas payments question in a slightly different way. Lynn and Brian, when you look at your revenue mix holistically, what percentage of business looks like the Texas payment business, meaning it's more commodity, it's lower margin, it's business type. Either you can focus on up leveling or perhaps at the time you might consider walking away from. Give us a sense of what sort of what the size of that quantum of business could look like today and where that could go longer term.
Lynn Moore: Yeah. I think it's pretty small. Brian's looking for the numbers. Again, this is this was something we inherited with the NIC acquisition. It's not been a strategic focus for Tyler. When we talked earlier about our relationship with other payment providers, these are opportunities where we might be able to partner with them where they can provide those types of services and we can come on and do the types of things that around that that make our offering differentiated. You know, I think we talked a couple of years ago and it was something that was in the works when we acquired NIC. We talked about the IRS contract. That was another example of a pure payments and we quote had won that contract. They got it got protested and we subsequently lost it. You know, we built that into our with margins comparable to Texas. While we were disappointed that we lost it, it really it wasn't a strategic initiative for us. It's not a place we want to grow. And I wouldn't expect that going forward, Brian. Do you have?
Brian Miller: Yeah. We really we have two other enterprise states where we have separate payment contracts from the enterprise agreement, but they are states where we provide a lot of other portal services, other digital government services. It's just the payments contracts are separate. We have one other state, Florida, which is a payments-only contract. But it has a lot of differences from Texas. We have a lot of other value-added services that we provide there. And it's a very different kind of an arrangement in Texas. Other than that, we really don't have a lot of pure what we kind of call commoditized payments business. Generally, it's either at the state level when it's part of an enterprise agreement where we're providing a lot of services, many of which payments are associated with them, or now with our focus on the local level integrating it with our back-office software solutions and proprietary solutions that add that value.
Lynn Moore: Yeah. I think just to answer that, Gabriela, as you know, a year ago, I changed all of our senior executive comp. When we look at our long-term performance drivers around margin and ARR to exclude the impact of merchant fees because it is we do not want to pursue these contracts which could, quote, theoretically, increase our ARR, but decrease our margins. So, you know, when I look internally at how I look at the business, I have all my presentations show me with and without merchant fees because that's really just to me showing the health of the business. Texas and its impact this year, I just want to remind you that this is something that's winding down this year, but we will continue to see the same headwind next year on a top-line basis. But excluding those merchant fees, like, as we said earlier, you know, Tyler's growing at right at 10%. Our transactions are growing between 15% and 17%. That shows the health of the business and where we're strategically going in the future.
Gabriela Borges: Thanks, Lynn. Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Lynn Moore, Chief Executive Officer, for final closing remarks. Please go ahead.
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Calvin, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. If you have any other questions, please feel free to contact Brian Miller or myself. Thanks again, and have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes your conference call. We thank you for participating and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-24 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to today's Tyler Technologies Third Quarter 2024 Conference Call. Your host for today's call is Lynn Moore, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session and instruction will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, October 24, 2024. I would like to turn the call over to Hala Elsherbini, Tyler's Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Lynn?
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Hala. We carried our momentum from the first half of the year into the third quarter and delivered remarkably strong results. The quarter was highlighted by strong top and bottom line performance, even as we saw a more pronounced shift towards SaaS and our new software contract mix, particularly in public safety, where expected on-premise license deals shifted to SaaS contracts in the quarter resulting in license revenues that were below plan. SaaS and transaction revenues fueled our growth and both exceeded our expectations. Our non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 25.4%, benefiting from our cloud efficiency initiatives and improved professional services margins and free cash flow reached a new quarterly high. As we've discussed in the past, our progress towards our 2025 and 2030 targets will not be linear. But our results through the first 9 months of this year bolster our confidence in achieving those top targets. We are beginning to see benefits from our cloud operations initiatives with efficiencies reflected in our results somewhat ahead of plan. Recurring revenues grew 12.1% and comprised 85% of our total revenues. Our SaaS revenues growth of 20.3% represents our 15th consecutive quarter of SaaS revenue growth of 20% or more, consistent with our target of a 20% CAGR in SaaS revenues through 2025. The public sector market remains robust, supported by healthy budgets and an increased focus on modernizing aging mission-critical systems through cloud adoption. The strong market activity we've discussed for the past few quarters along with excellent execution by our sales teams, is reflected in our new software bookings this quarter with our new SaaS contract value of approximately $105.6 million, up 78% over last year. Our leading market position, anchored by our deep domain expertise and large installed base forms the foundation of our long-term strategic focus on 4 key growth drivers: executing our cloud-first strategy, leveraging our unmatched installed base, expanding into new markets and growing our payments business. Our cloud-first strategy is a pivotal driver of our success and continues to shape our future in our cloud living culture. We are leading with cloud across our product portfolio as the public sector market continues to embrace digital modernization and choose Tyler's next-generation cloud solutions. Additionally, we've made substantial progress with our cloud optimization efforts, driving efficiencies and scalability, while also making solid progress on version consolidation to further accelerate on-premise client migrations and enable clients to easily expand their mission-critical applications in the cloud. The pendulum is continuing to shift to the cloud with both new and existing clients, and we are seeing a growing trend of client-driven SaaS adoption. This is especially apparent in areas that have previously lagged the rest of our market in terms of cloud adoption, most notably, the public safety market, along with the state and federal market with our application platform. Overall, SaaS arrangements comprised 97% of our new software contract value in the third quarter. For the second consecutive quarter, 100% of our public safety new contract value was SaaS compared to only 28% a year ago. It was also a great quarter for flip signings as we signed a total of 108 flips of on-premises clients. The total contract value from flips was more than triple that of last year's third quarter, and the average ARR of flips rose 37.2%. Our Courts & Justice business was very active in the third quarter. Our largest deal in the quarter was a contract with Kentucky Court of Justice for Enterprise Justice suite, including case manager, e-filing and court analytics in addition to payments. The initial 6-year term represents $35 million in total contract value, although only $10.6 million was recorded in bookings in backlog this quarter due to contract provisions. ARR starts at approximately $2.5 million and grows to $6.5 million in year 6, in addition to payments processing under a gross revenue model. Of note, the first 6 years of SaaS fees totaling $29 million was prepaid in October using ARPA funds. Other successful Tyler court clients and in particular, the North Carolina Administrative Office of the Courts served as strong references in this competitive sales process that span more than 12 years. Kentucky is our 17th statewide courts client and our third statewide enterprise justice solution deployed in the cloud. We also signed a 3-year $9.6 million SaaS contract for our Enterprise Justice suite with the Phoenix, Arizona Municipal Court. That agreement includes a cooperative master purchase agreement provision that enabled the Arizona Supreme Court to designate Tyler as a preferred software provider for all 170 courts in the state, including superior, justice and municipal courts, with the alternative option being the state's aging legacy system. We're excited about the opportunity to expand our partnership across Arizona courts with significant potential ARR. Other notable third quarter SaaS deals included a $12 million 5-year contract with the city of St. Petersburg, Florida, the fifth largest in the state for enterprise permitting and licensing and enterprise ERP utility billing solutions along with payments. We signed 6 SaaS contracts for our enterprise public safety solution, including 2 of the fastest-growing cities in the U.S., the City of Frisco, Texas Police Department for $750,000 in ARR and the City of Round Rock, Texas police for $730,000 in ARR. Central to our growth is leveraging our unmatched installed base and expanding our addressable market through strategic cross-sell and upsell activity that unlocks significant expansion opportunities with both new and existing clients. A key cross-sell win this quarter was a multiyear strategic contract with the Texas Office of Court Administration for our Texas Connected Justice Data Cloud. This includes alliance exchange, enterprise data platform, open data platform and our Digital Solutions division's engagement builder platform. This integrated solution captures real-time online data across every jurisdiction in the state. This multiyear engagement exemplifies our connected communities vision by creating a digital infrastructure for data sharing and decision-useful business intelligence and reporting. The contract adds $1.5 million in ARR and is the first of its kind in a large population state, paving the way for additional add-on opportunities. Another significant cross-sell win was a contract for the modernization of 18 different boards with the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation for our state regulatory application platform suite which also brings in augmented field operations, formerly ARInspect. The 3-year contract leveraged our Illinois state enterprise agreement and represents $9.2 million in total contract value, with a 7-year option that adds $12.5 million in total contract value. We're pleased to see an increasing number of our clients modernizing their enterprise solutions using our application platform. Driving payments adoption of our differentiated payments business is another key element in our growth strategy. In the third quarter, we signed 268 new payment deals across Tyler software clients, representing approximately $8.6 million in projected ARR. Riverside County, an existing property and recording software client is our first enterprise payments win in California. This collaborative effort expanded from initial property and recording payments contracts to processing payments for more than 10 agencies across the county, which is the fourth most populated county in California. In our enterprise portal business, we secured extensions for our digital government and payment processing services in 5 states, which includes winning competitive rebids for state enterprise portals in New Jersey and Indiana. We also expanded our scope with the state of Indiana to include resident engagement identity proofing for approximately $1 million in additional ARR. This builds on Tyler's chatbot front-end technology recently deployed representing the first AI project for Indiana and its residents. This solution was provided through a joint effort with our AI task force and our Indian state enterprise team in collaboration with the Indiana Office of Technology. Now I'd like Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our updated annual guidance for 2024.
Brian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. Total revenues for the quarter were $543.3 million, up 9.8% and organically grew 9.4%. Subscriptions revenue increased 17.6% and organically rose 17.3%. Within subscription, SaaS revenues grew 20.3% to $166.6 million and grew organically 19.7% against a tough comparison with last year's third quarter. Keep in mind that there's often a lag from the signing of a new SaaS dealer flip to the start of revenue recognition, they can vary from one to several quarters. Because of this, as well as the timing of SaaS renewals and related price increases, SaaS revenue growth both year-over-year and sequentially may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Transaction revenues grew 15.2% to $180.5 million, driven by higher transaction volumes from both new and existing clients, including the August go-live of the California Department of Parks and Recreation. SaaS deals comprised approximately 97% of our Q3 new software contract value compared to 80% last year. During the quarter, we added 181 new SaaS arrangements and converted 108 existing on-premises clients to SaaS, with a total contract value of approximately $141 million. In Q3 of last year, we added 161 new SaaS arrangements and had 79 flips with a total contract value of approximately $71 million. The average ARR from new SaaS contracts increased 38% over last year. The average ARR associated with our Q3 flips increased 37% over last year as larger clients such as Cobb County, Georgia and Providence, Rhode Island flips to the cloud. Our total annualized recurring revenue was approximately $1.85 billion, up 12.1% and organically grew 11.8%. We entered 2024 expecting operating margin expansion after experiencing the margin trough from our cloud transition in 2023. Our non-GAAP operating margin in the third quarter was 25.4% up 60 basis points from last year. The margin expansion reflects the impact of our cloud efficiency initiatives, along with effective operating expense management and improved professional services margins. As we discussed on previous calls, merchant and interchange fees from our payment business under the gross revenue model have a meaningful impact on our overall margins as they are passed through to clients and are included in both revenues and cost of revenues. We incurred merchant fees of approximately $42 million in Q3 compared to $36 million last year. Because of strong earnings and effective working capital management, both cash flows, operations and free cash flow reached new quarterly highs at $263.7 million and $252.9 million, respectively, with free cash flow up 55.5%. Cash flow in the quarter was positively impacted by the deferral to the fourth quarter of approximately $14 million of federal tax payments. We ended the quarter with $600 million of convertible debt outstanding and cash and investments of approximately $548 million. Our net leverage at quarter end was approximately 0.1 times trailing 12-month pro forma EBITDA. In September, we replaced our existing $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a new facility that matures in 2029, increasing the size to $700 million in improving terms. This new revolver further improves our available liquidity and provide us with maximum flexibility to address potential financing needs. Our updated 2024 annual guidance is as follows: we expect total revenues will be between $2.125 billion and $2.145 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 9%. We expect that merchant fees will be up approximately 7% over last year and that implied organic growth, excluding merchant fees would be approximately 20 basis points higher. We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be between $6.13 and $6.28 and may vary significantly due to the impact of discrete tax items on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $9.47 and $9.62. We expect our free cash flow margin will be between 21% and 23%, including an estimated impact of approximately $54 million of incremental cash taxes related to Section 174. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release and in the Q3 earnings deck posted on our website. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn.
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. As we close out another strong quarter, I want to highlight the consistently high level of execution and collaboration across our teams, which is even more critical to our ongoing success as we leverage a fully enabled cloud infrastructure to deliver continuous innovation and enhanced client experience. The strength of our One Tyler team is rooted in a shared commitment to excellence and to our mission, vision and values, which drives our ability to execute at high levels. During the quarter, we were recognized by Newsweek as one of America's greenest companies, placing us among the top 500 greenest companies in the United States based on environmental sustainability. We were also named the Newsweek's America's greatest workplaces for parents and families 2024 list. We're gratified by this recognition of our commitment to fostering a strong inclusive culture with a healthy work-life balance and high-quality benefits. Now we'd like to open up the line for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ken Wong from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Ken Wong: Lots of momentum this quarter on the cloud side. I wanted to maybe dive into that 3 times on the TCV of flips up to $36 million. Lynn or Brian, do you think this is a new run rate? Or is this just more of a one-off quarterly dynamic here?
Brian Miller: As we said, these can be a little bit lumpy. This was a strong quarter with some larger flips, but that's a trend that we're seeing, more of our larger customers that have been slower to flip to the cloud, more complicated projects are now starting to move at a faster pace and the progress we've made with version consolidation over the last couple of years has also helped get us in a position to facilitate that as more of those customers are now on current versions of software and have gone through that upgrade process to put them in a position to move to the cloud. So I think as we've said in the past, we should expect to continue to see growth in the flip volume and the size of flips and we sort of envision a bell curve-shaped trend of those over the next 3 or 4 years, and we're still kind of moving up the left-hand side of that bell curve. But it could be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. But generally, we expect to continue to see the flips growth to achieve the targets we set out for 2030 of 80% to 85% of our on-prem base having moved to the cloud by then.
Lynn Moore: Yes. Just to amplify, Ken, Brian is right. It will tend to be lumpy. I don't think I would model this as our new run rate, which was your question. But we do expect to see this continued momentum.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt VanVliet from BTIG. Your line is open.
Matt VanVliet: I'd be curious in terms of what you saw of sales linearity throughout the third quarter and maybe into October? And are you seeing at least lately any pressure of maybe decisions not being made until after the election? Or any impact there? But maybe just overall, what you're seeing in terms of demand linearity?
Lynn Moore: Yes. That's a good question. We're actually not seeing any slowdowns or hesitations due to the election. Generally speaking, when you look across all the business units at Tyler and particularly at our flagship products, most of our divisions are either at or exceeding their sales plans for the year. And so that's been good. The things that we've been talking in the past couple of quarters have continued. And so we're not seeing any slowdown at this point or any pauses due to any macro factors or the election.
Brian Miller: And really not any changes in linearity, we tend not to be super back-end loaded within quarters, and I don't think we've seen any change in that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line from Alexei Gogolev from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Alexei Gogolev: Lynn, I had a question about the incremental competition during the quarter. Are you seeing more pressure from players like ServiceNow and intelligence and analytics, in Workday in ERP? Or have those competitors subsided as demand in their core markets begins to recover?
Lynn Moore: I think generally stepping back, the competitive landscape is has been pretty neutral throughout the year. I wouldn't say there's been any significant increased competition or any decreased competition. As you know, all of our -- I think when you look at our -- the subverticals like ERP, we certainly see more competition from players that are more horizontal players like Workday, we see them -- I don't know that we see them a significant amount more than we have in the past. When you talk about ServiceNow and our -- against our platform solution, we see them in that space, but we're kind of a different offering. And a lot of the things that were -- the application platform plays best is are areas where ServiceNow is really probably a little bit bigger and heavier. So overall, I think the competitive landscape is generally the same. I think our -- when I look at win rates, they've generally been consistent and were consistent in Q3 with what we've been experiencing over the past several quarters and probably a couple of years.
Alexei Gogolev: And Brian, a quick question on 2025 guidance that you've provided last year. Directionally, would you be able to suggest that you think you could see top line growth acceleration next year versus this year. And how are you thinking about free cash flow margin that you provided considering the net working capital improvements that you've just reported?
Brian Miller: Sure. Well, we're obviously not ready to give our '25 guidance yet and we're in our planning process and kind of in the early stages of that. I think what we've talked about is that we're probably a little bit ahead of where we targeted 2025 along the path to our 2030 targets. But we said it's not linear. And being a little bit ahead doesn't necessarily mean where we finish up '25 or 2030 will be significantly ahead of those initial targets. So we're confident around those. I think specifically on the cash flow side, we're certainly well ahead of that. We're above where we targeted 2025 already. There are some things that have been affected this year that are a little bit more onetime. But I think generally, this would be a level we'd look to build off of for 2025. So I do expect that '25, our cash flow will be at least kind of consistent with where we are this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
Michael Turrin: On the transaction business, ARR there are meaningful, we're used to seeing that may be down sequentially in 3Q, and it was up this year. I know you had a comment on a go live, but anything else you'd point us towards and drivers of the transaction revenue base? And is the seasonality there at all changing?
Brian Miller: I don't think there's really a change in the seasonality. And typically, the last half of the year is slower in terms of volumes. But that's been offset really by a couple of things. One is the revenues from new payments clients that we've added over the course of the last year, we've been disclosing those numbers. And consistently close to a couple of hundred this quarter, significantly above that in terms of the number of new payments customers that we're adding within our software client base. And we're also having better experience in getting those clients live faster and getting those revenues flowing faster from the time we sign them to the time that they're onboarded, and that's having a positive impact. And then within the transactions business in general, what we alluded to in terms of some new customers to the California State Parks contract that we signed late last year went live this quarter. That added about $3 million of revenue, although it wasn't a full quarter impact. Various things like in Florida with our payments contract the Florida turnpikes with SunPass went live during the quarter, and that added a couple of million dollars of new revenues. So it's really a combination of new business as well as increased volume. So we're seeing greater adoption through our client base, and we're working with our clients to help them get more of their citizens doing things online and running through our systems.
Lynn Moore: Yes. And to amplify that a little, Michael, I mean Brian is right. We are starting to experience -- we're learning better. The onboarding efficiencies is bringing revenue recognition faster, which is great. The California State go live, I want to emphasize that for a minute because that's a big deal. I mean, we signed this contract late last year in less than 3 quarters, we were up and live. And remember, this is the largest contract in Tyler's history. And we've talked about this sometimes on the call, and it gets lost sometimes in the numbers. But really, the secret sauce of Tyler is execution. And it's our sales execution. It's our implementation execution, it's our support, it's management. And it just -- it takes a lot to do what we do. And we signed over 200 new deals, 100 flips a quarter. That's a lot of business that's going on, and it's the work of our teams and the execution is what provides that referenceability that keeps the engine running. And to get a big go-live in California to go basically on time and on budget is really a great accomplishment for our teams and sets us up not only well to execute on that contract. But then to -- for others to look at that success and duplicate that in other jurisdictions.
Michael Turrin: Just a small follow-on clarification, if I may, on the prior question. I think the primary question we're getting is just on the free cash flow performance. So Brian, just in summarizing some of what you said previously, it sounds like, is there anything you could do to help quantify anything that would fall into the more onetime basket. And it sounds like while you're not updating 2025 targets here, there's no reason to expect margin to go down next year relative to what you're delivering. You're just kind of working through plans. Is that the right takeaway for us at this point?
Brian Miller: Yes, I think so. We're kind of at a little bit higher level than we had initially planned. I don't know that we would grow in terms of a margin significantly from where we are right now. But again, that's ahead of where we plan to be. The biggest onetime thing, which really will be reflected in the fourth quarter that's reflected in our full year guidance is what Lynn mentioned around the Kentucky courts contract where they are prepaying or prepaid in October, 6 years of SaaS payments. So there's a $29 million bump. That's not a typical situation that we see we're happy to accept that payment, but it's not typical. So that's the biggest onetime thing we're seeing that pull forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Terry Tillman from Truist. Your line is open.
Terry Tillman: It's great to hear the call out from my home state, Kentucky, multiple times. I have one question. It's a multiparter though. I think, Lynn, you've talked in your prepared remarks and it's in the press release around cross-selling success. What I'm curious is have you done things go-to-market kind of organized to kind of drive more of that pattern recognition? And what are some common plays you see for kind of the cross-selling? Like what product in particular seems to stand out? And then the second part of this question is the reality there's another milestone here for cross-selling success once you get these flips kind of stood up. And so maybe we could see a step-up even in more cross-selling once they're kind of stable on new kind of cloud technology.
Lynn Moore: Yes. Good questions, Terry. I'll start with the second one. The answer to that is yes. I think part of the part of the equation of doing flips is it brings actually the uptake, we call it more upselling. But yes, that is part of that equation. And I do think it's something. It's another opportunity for us to be in front of the client. Another opportunity to add additional products as they're making another decision. On cross-selling, there's a lot of things that go into that. And I would say things that we have done internally over the last year, 12, 18 months have played a significant role in that. I've talked -- I think I've talked about that on some prior calls, things that we've done around how we comp our sales people, how we comp the different divisions what that basis is. And we've moved to a more of a One Tyler compensation level so that basically, if there are multiple divisions that are contributing to a sales process, we don't have to fight over who's getting the credit because the credit, it shouldn't really matter, if's Tyler wins. And so we've done things internally that I think have broken down internal barriers that have just sort of, I think, grease the wheels a little bit more. In terms of product suites, it's funny, yes, some tend to go a little bit more than others. Sometimes you may get some Courts & Justice products that tie well to our Public Safety products. Sometimes, for example, we did a significant deal this quarter in Kenosha, Wisconsin. That was our ERP full suite. It would also include enterprise, appraisal and tax including our municipal justice. Big integrated story, Gartner-led procurement about $1.6 million in ARR. So while there are products that sort of sometimes naturally seem to go together, our integrated story and the Tyler story tends to also sometimes bring products together in deals that you might not necessarily think on the face of it that, that would have been an inclusive sale, but we're seeing that. We also saw that in St. Petersburg, Florida. I think I mentioned that in my prepared remarks. That was enterprise permanent license, but it also brought in our utility billing and payments. That was almost a $2 million ARR deal. So we're seeing progress and a lot of it is the result of some internal initiatives, and it's just the more success we're having in the market and selling that sort of integrated story of Tyler is resonating.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Reilly from Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Joshua Reilly: So after being at the IACP event here, one of the topics that came up was where customers are at in terms of version consolidation. Just wanted to get an update on some of the key product areas where we are at with that. I believe Public Safety is at around 30%, which might get a bit behind some of the other larger products? And how do you think about the benefit to margins over the next several quarters as you get more up-to-date there?
Lynn Moore: No, good question, Josh. I think I talked about on the last call, version consolidation is a big piece of what we call Phase 1 of our cloud transition. And each of our flagship products have been going at different paces because they have different starting points. I would say, generally speaking, sitting here in the fall of 2024, I'm pleased with where we are at version consolidation. I think we're ahead of where I thought we would have been looking back 2 or 3 years ago. And some of our products, this is a heavier lift. But if you look, for example, at our Courts & Justice, our Enterprise Justice solution, you look at our enterprise ERP solution, we have an overwhelming number of clients now that are down to 1 or 2 versions, far removed from the days of having 5, 6, 7 versions out in the field. I think that's part of what you're seeing with our outperformance this year. We talked about our margin outperformance being driven in part by some of our cloud efficiencies. Those cloud efficiencies are -- our products are getting more optimized to be run in AWS. But we're also seeing the benefits of that version consolidation. It takes a lot less people to maintain and support fixed bugs on a single version or even 2 versions than 6 or 7 versions. And that's part of what we're looking at when we start talking about Phase 2 of our cloud strategy, which is what we call cloud living. It's getting all of our clients onto that single version, getting them on really short release cycles, less disruptive, large versions out in the field, higher client set. So I think we're making really good progress there. I do expect that to continue to help gross margins as we look towards our Tyler 2030 goals, that's where some of that gross margin improvement is going to come. And again, I'm pleased with where we're at right now on version consolidation.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Gabriela Borges: Lynn and Brian, I wanted to ask, given your experience in the space, we're clearly in a really healthy part of the budgeting cycle and the willingness to spend cycle across state and local governments. How should we be thinking about the sustainability of some of the healthy demand that you're seeing. And maybe just level set us on the ARPA funds, how much of a benefit do you think that you're seeing today versus how much could you see in 2025 and 2026 as the funds that are committed to actually get spent?
Lynn Moore: Yes, Gabriela, I think overall, I mean, budgets have been at a pretty good level for, I'd say, a couple of years now. And I can't predict what's going to happen 3 or 5 years from now. I can't even predict what's going to happen in 2 weeks with the election. But I think our outlook right now and what we're seeing in leading sales indicators is we see that continue -- that level staying for the foreseeable future, our RFP counts, our demo counts, all those leading sales indicators are strong and are consistent with prior quarters and really the last couple of years. And so those are really the data points that I look at most. I'm sorry, I forgot the second question.
Brian Miller: ARPA funds.
Lynn Moore: ARPA funds have been an interesting topic over the last several years. There are certain deals that were clearly driven by ARPA funds. We talked about the Kentucky Enterprise Justice deal where they prepaid that all up front. We also had a significant deal, the Arizona Supreme Court deal that I mentioned in my prepared remarks, was also funded by ARPA funds. We don't always know and we haven't always known when ARPA is the trigger and what we've said over the past, sometimes, it's not the direct trigger, but it may have freed up other opportunities. There's been a hesitancy sometimes in our business to use ARPA funds given the recurring nature, they sometimes tend to have been used more on onetime things. We saw that sort of in our student transportation business, maybe for a large purchase of hardware, something like that. I think they've been helpful over the last few years. I don't think that's been a major tailwind to growth in sales. That's not what we're hearing from our sales folks.
Brian Miller: But those do -- until the end of '26 to send those dollars. So some of those things that ARPA funds will be used for may not even have started. They may have been committed but internally, but haven't even started the buying process. And just, for example, like with the Kentucky deal, even though they're using ARPA funds to pay 6 years of SaaS, that was a 12-year sales process from the time we started talking to them. So the deal didn't materialize because of ARPA funds, but it affected -- so we wouldn't say that, that deal just happened because of ARPA and wouldn't have happened without it, but it certainly benefited the timing of it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays. Your line is open.
Saket Kalia: Lynn, maybe for you, just to hit on a little bit of a different topic. Tyler's services has always been really important for your government customers. But it's been interesting to see that business over time grow just a little bit slower than the rest of the software business. So maybe the question is, could you maybe speak to how the services intensity in the business is changing as Tyler becomes more of a SaaS company, and maybe relatedly, Brian, for you, maybe touch on how that impacts margins over time.
Lynn Moore: Yes, that's a good question. And actually, I'll start a little bit, too, with what you asked Brian, is part of our outperformance this year has been our services gross margins. And that has been something that we have focused on at a management level over the last couple of years, and you're starting to see some of that. So a good management focus and attention. It's also been a function of the labor market. So the labor markets have really stabilized. We're seeing a lot less turnover and high turnover in our services areas creates a lot of inefficiencies. It takes a long time for people to get onboarded, up to speed and out and billable. But we've had some other internal initiatives that really help drive those professional services. As we look out over the next several years, I would expect our services to remain relatively flat. In fact, next year, they may actually decrease a little bit. That's a function of a couple of things. I think it is a function of efficiencies and how we can onboard clients. We've done some internal initiatives around that which also a function of in our -- some of our really large implementations, like in Courts & Justice and a lot of customization work. We're moving away from that. We don't have as many of those on the horizon and the whole concept of clients having one-off custom applications is something that we are moving. It's part of our cloud living goals as move forward. So it's a number of factors there. It is something that's been a focus of it. But you're right, it has been declining as a percentage of revenues. And as I look out, I would expect it to stay flat to decline as compared to other growth in our revenue lines.
Brian Miller: Yes. So just as Lynn said, less services in the mix. Services are lowest margin, and in fact, historically, have had a negative margin. So the combination of less services in the mix from all those factors that Lynn mentioned, combined with improving margins on the services we are doing should continue to have a positive impact on our margins. And we pointed that out as one of the not the biggest, but one of the factors in driving towards our 2030 margin targets.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Charlie Strauzer from CJS Securities. Your line is open.
Charlie Strauzer: Lynn and Brian, when you talk to clients who are somewhat hesitant to flip, what are some of the reasons why they're so cautious? And ultimately, how do you convince them otherwise?
Lynn Moore: I think some of the reasons are just some of the historic reasons, control. You've got people maybe who are not -- have been there a long time. They're used to having control of their systems, control of everything. I think what happens is, we've talked about aging technology, but also aging infrastructure starts to lead to more and more openness to flips. I think you also see the increase in cyber attacks, creating a different sort of demand and new demand for flips. But I think also we talk a lot about how everything we do is public. Every implementation we do all -- every county, every city looks at their neighbors, looks across jurisdictions to see what's going on. And whatever hesitancy that people may have felt 5 years ago, 7 years ago, as they see their neighboring jurisdictions make those decisions and the success that they're having, and I'll go back to my comment earlier about our success in executing and they see us being able to get them up and live and running in a better environment. I think that starts to break down those barriers as we move forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Oliver from Baird. Your line is open.
Rob Oliver: Lynn, I just wanted to go back quickly to the question earlier regarding the ARPA funds. Given the fact that we have a deadline now to obligate these funds, I know you guys have been hesitant to draw a direct line between them and the actual deals. And you alluded to the Kentucky win, which is obviously exciting in Courts & Justice, but you noted that it was over a decade in the hopper. What, if anything, is your sales force doing now at state and local to be in front of your customers to talk about that commit process, how Tyler products could be useful. I know the vendor decision doesn't need to be made necessarily by the end of December. But I just -- I guess, another way of asking the previous question from Gabriela in terms of confidence that we might see more deals that could be supportive of that '25 and '26 progress, the deadline by which they need to spend it.
Lynn Moore: Yes, Rob, I don't know that we're doing anything different than we've done in the last couple of years. All of our sales teams have been armed with information on ARPA funds. They're armed with the right marketing materials. They generally know what's around. They've got their talking points. But I'll reiterate, I don't think -- I can't draw a direct correlation over the last few years of ARPA funds to Tyler's performance in a material way. It has definitely been part of the overall environment. But again, as I said, as I look at indicators going out into the future, the things that we track that sort of help us track demand and budgets. Those are remaining pretty consistent right now. So I'm not suggesting that ARPA hasn't been helpful. I just -- I have not been able to really draw a material one-on-one direct correlation to that other than, obviously, some deals, but the Kentucky deal. I think the interesting thing about that is it sometimes -- it highlights really sometimes the long nature of these sales processes and the tenacity of us and the long-term nature of everything we do in our long-term vision and staying power there was 12 years later, and we benefited from cash flow with ARPA funds, but we were going to get that deal whether ARPA funds were available or not.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Your line is open.
Jonathan Ho: Can you give us a little bit of sense around the AI opportunity? I think you referenced one large deal and how your customers are maybe thinking about leveraging AI over time and what that means from an upsell perspective?
Lynn Moore: Yes. Jonathan, it's -- we're starting to see a little bit of questions in RFPs around AI and what AI technology we're using, how we're leveraging it. I don't think anything right now has changed from what we've said over the last couple of quarters. We're focusing our efforts on sort of right now, trying to decide where exactly we want to put most of our resources behind AI internal versus external facing solutions. I still continue to believe that there's a lot of applicability pointing inward in things that we can do on repetitive type activity that some of our employees do. But we have seen an uptick. I mean we made the acquisition of CSI last year. AI is a deeply embedded part of that solution is having a lot of success in the market. ARInspect has some AI tools, and I mentioned the ARInspect deal on the portion of the Illinois deal that I talked about earlier. So we're doing things around AI. Customers are starting to be more open about talking about it. I think a year ago, clients were probably really hesitant. It's not a driver right now in deals, but they're curiosity and their interest is starting to surface. And my guess is we'll hear more about it when we get together connect next year and probably even more about it the following year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Housum from Northcoast Research. Your line is open.
Keith Housum: In terms of like the acquisition front, you've got favorable debt terms, you're generating a good amount of cash. How are you guys thinking about acquisitions now? And then in terms of more specifically, is there specific end markets within your business that you're thinking that could benefit from acquisitions more than others? And perhaps what would they be?
Lynn Moore: Yes, Keith, we're viewing it similarly. I mean, I've talked about the last couple of years, our priority is debt pay down. Our cash balances are approaching what our convertibles do in about 16, 17 months. And so we're looking. We always look. We've been looking, I look at deals every quarter. we're probably a little pickier right now than we might otherwise be. But I do think as we go into 2025 and then into 2026, we're not going to change our standards. We're not going to change our valuation approach. But I do think you'll see us -- I'll probably evaluate more and maybe a deal that we might have said, “Hey, maybe we don't do it right now, that might tip in that direction”. We don't have anything specific right now in the hopper. We do talk internally about really what's the best area for us to go get our bang for a buck. And should we sort of start being a little more proactive as opposed to reactive. Those are discussions we're having internally. But generally, as it relates to capital, our stance is kind of the same right now, but I can see that evolving over the next 12, 18 months.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schappel from Loop Capital. Your line is open.
Mark Schappel: John, a question for you. Building on the earlier question on version consolidation which has been somewhat of a gating item to get customers to migrate to the cloud. Could you just discuss some of the characteristics that you're using to encourage customers to move to the latest product release?
John Marr: Well, there's a combination of things. And each of our products are in different stages of using those combination of things. Some of them have been maybe some minor financial considerations. Some of them have been only new feature will be available in the cloud, some of it will be -- we're no longer going to support a version of the cloud. We haven't drawn a lot of those hard sticks yet, particularly with our flagships. But it's a variety of things that's going on. I think clients also are starting to realize the benefit and the need to get upgraded. Part of the -- what happened is when particularly when clients have multiple products of ours and those products are on multiple different years of versions. It's really hard for the products to talk. And I think you also see it with support calls. You've got clients who might have been on a version that's 4 or 5 years old and they're having issues, but what they didn't realize is that those issues were corrected in a version 3 years ago, they just didn't take the upgrade. So it's sales pitch. it's things we're doing internally. It's a variety of things. It's not one thing. And each one is in a different stage. As I talked before, we're doing multiple cloud transitions, which means we're doing multiple version consolidations at the same time.
Brian Miller: But with respect to version consolidation specifically, I guess, you call it a stick is that we actually are sunsetting older versions and giving clients certainly ample notice. But letting clients know the version they're on, the oldest versions will no longer be supported after a certain date and working with them to move them to the current version for that date. And we've done that with multiple products. We've sunset multiple old versions of our enterprise ERP solution, our Enterprise Justice solution and have made significant progress in moving those customers to current versions as we discontinue support of the older versions.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Clarke Jeffries from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Clarke Jeffries: A question for Brian on the sort of the pace of the SaaS revenue I know you had quoted that the volatility of SaaS revenue, the timing of the go-lives from booked to a live system can be variable. But I just wanted to ask, we have 2 years now where the sequential growth in Q3 is the highest. I wanted to understand if that's purely circumstantial if there's any emerging seasonality to those go live. Any prerogative of these governments to get live on a Q3 or is that just really reflective of typically high Q4 bookings activity?
Brian Miller: Yes. It's probably more the latter. I don't think there's a certain characteristic or something that's causing that. It's probably around the timing, especially bigger customers, and it varies by market. For example, in the schools market, which is smaller for us, but they typically have a big push more in Q2 because they want to have new systems live before a new school year starts. Fiscal years don't really have as much to do with it. So I think it's more circumstantial.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Alex Zukin: Congrats on another solid quarter. I'll ask maybe a longer-term question. I think it's been alluded to a little bit. But again, as we think about AI, both agentic, copilot or system and you think about the customers that are starting to ask those questions. You think about the breadth of solutions that you're offering, both to your customers and across the portfolio of products. As we think about that monetization pathway, is that something we should think about maybe on top of the long-term guidance that you provided at the last Analyst Day through 2030, or is that embedded in there? I ask because it seems like the pace of the innovation wave has moved so fast since you guys fully were even able to contemplate that. So how do we think about those, the top line growth characteristics that could be associated there? And any incremental potential margin degradation or headwinds or thoughts about that? And then I have a quick follow-up.
Lynn Moore: Yes, sure, Alex. The short answer is, yes, when we gave our 2030 targets, we did not bake in efficiencies, internal efficiencies on any gross margin lines that were going to be driven by AI nor did we really bake in any sales that were really a result of either new products, products, newly developed products or newly acquired products. To the extent, AI was already in some of our products, we already had sort of some long-term sales road maps. So perhaps a little bit, but not in terms of additional R&D, additional M&A. And so that's the way I would think about it. I'd just remember that we're taking a very deliberative approach to AI. And while I say that we're hearing more and more customers start to have things in their RFPs around AI. It's not a majority yet. And I think our clients will still be a little bit conservative. But when you start looking out 5, 7 years, those opportunities are there, and we're not going to wait 5 to 7 years to then spin up initiatives. We will be doing those along the way. And to the extent there was some major R&D initiative, which hypothetically because that's not right now on our road map and it adjusted our -- an R&D expense line or something we would obviously signal that and tell you that. But in terms of our long-term targets, no, no significant AI benefits, either margin or revenue were baked in.
Alex Zukin: And to what extent, maybe this is just a clarification. To what extent are you hearing or seeing in sales cycles that those types of questions are actually facilitating or we're amplifying flips or converts either the timeline around them or the momentum or enthusiasm. And then on free cash flow, Brian, again, I think the outperformance obviously both in the quarter and the guide for the full year, very notable. You noted that one Kentucky prepayment contract. How do we think about like when, where and like why those prepayments happen. And more so, as we look to '25 and beyond, is there any reason to assume that those would happen more frequently or less frequently and kind of changing the complexion of the free cash flow margins.
Brian Miller: Yes. The prepayment was really kind of a one-off thing where at least relative to that size of that were -- and that actually will show up in the fourth quarter cash flow. But that was, again, ARPA funds being used to prepay 6 years of SaaS payments. I don't think that would be the norm. The thing that I think more consistent with an impact on free cash flow is the characteristics around the transaction business. That transaction revenues, whether they're payments or e-filing and those sorts of things. We generally get paid at the time of the transaction or very quickly after it. So we're not carrying large receivables there. So the cash flow characteristics of that transaction business are very attractive. And so as it continues to grow even at a tick higher than the rest of our business, that has a positive impact on cash flow. We've also had really effective management around our receivables and have brought down our DSOs and continue to manage that. And that helps as well that those revenues are typically paid in advance, annually in advance as opposed to carrying long -- bigger receivables. So really, the transaction business is probably the biggest grower of improved margins and cash flow.
Lynn Moore: Yes. And the follow-up question on AI and sales. I mean, it's -- clients aren't looking for AI for AI's sake but there are -- when you look at our CSI acquisition, the document redaction solution, there's an ROI involved. There's an ROI for the clients. And that's a big sales point. They can do things with that system that used to take a lot of people to do, and they've removed that manual labor, that manual toil. And so yes, things like that are driving sales.
Operator: That concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to President and CEO, Lynn Moore, for closing remarks.
Lynn Moore: All right. Thanks, Rob, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Brian Miller or myself. Thanks, everybody. Have a great day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-25 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to today's Tyler Technologies Second Quarter 2024 Conference Call. Your host for today's call is Lynn Moore, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, July 25, 2024. I would like to turn the call over to Hala Elsherbini, Tyler's Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Hala Elsherbini: Thank you, Matt, and welcome to our call. With me today is Lynn Moore, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. After I give the safe harbor statement, Lynn will have some initial comments on our quarter, and then Brian will review the details of our results and update our annual guidance for 2024. Lynn will end with some additional comments, and then we'll take your questions. During this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information and may include projections concerning the Company's future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Also, in our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We have also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financials tab, schedules with supplemental information, including information about quarterly recurring revenues and bookings. On the Events and Presentations tab, we posted an earnings summary slide deck to supplement our prepared remarks. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Lynn?
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Hala. We built on the momentum from our strong first quarter performance to, again, deliver exceptional second quarter results marked by consistently high execution and a continuation of solid operating and financial performance. Each of our key metrics across revenues, earnings, operating margin and cash flow exceeded our expectations. These results are especially meaningful given the significant shift towards SaaS in our new software contract mix, which pressured revenues and margins. Recurring revenues grew 8.4% and comprised 83% of our total revenues. SaaS revenues grew 23.2%, our 14th consecutive quarter of SaaS revenue growth of 20% or more above our target of a 20% CAGR in SaaS revenues through 2025. In addition, transaction revenues were ahead of plan driven by higher transaction volumes, including an increase in e-filing volumes and expanded payment services. Since committing to our cloud-first strategy in 2019, we've been intently focused on supporting our public sector's clients' digital transformation and guiding their migration to Tyler's next-generation cloud applications. Last year, we reached an inflection point where valuable, long-term recurring SaaS revenues surpassed on-premises' license and maintenance revenues. We're pleased to reach another milestone as we have now essentially completed the exit of our Dallas data center. This move is a significant achievement in our cloud migration road map as we continue to scale our deployments at AWS and drive more durable growth and margin benefits from our SaaS-based operating model. The public sector market remains healthy, characterized by high levels of RFP and sales demo activity. Our new business pipeline remains at elevated levels, reflecting the robust market environment, growing cross-sell opportunities and continued strong execution by our sales organization. Our leading market position and competitive strengths, including our deep domain expertise continue to differentiate us in the marketplace. These strengths underpin our long-term strategic focus on four key growth drivers, leveraging our unmatched installed base, expanding into new markets, completing our cloud transition and growing our payments business. Our large client base represents one of our most significant assets, and we're pleased to see strong go-to-market execution with significant cross-sell and upsell wins during the quarter, which included a joint effort with our Justice Group, leveraging our Digital Solution division's strong relationships in Florida, for an agreement with the Florida Department of Corrections to manage all aspects of money transfer services for correctional facilities across the state. The contract brings together disbursement solutions from our Rapid Financial Solutions acquisition, inmate trust and accounting and e-communications from the VendEngine acquisitions and payments through our Digital Solutions division. A single sourced enterprise supervision and enterprise public safety contract with Cherokee Nation, Oklahoma, adding to its existing enterprise ERP solutions. The SaaS agreement was a joint collaborative sales effort resulting in a total Tyler client win. Additionally, we continue to innovate and elevate our clients' resident engagement experience by empowering citizens with direct connections to government through Tyler's MyCivic platform. In Mississippi, we expanded citizen access to mental health resources with the Mississippi State Department of Health, leveraging our state enterprise agreement. We continue to advance our cloud transition and make substantial progress with our product version consolidation efforts, which will accelerate our continued migration of on-premises clients to the cloud. We're also pleased with the numerous second quarter SaaS contract wins, which underscore the public sector market's recognition of cloud benefits, including enhanced security. One of the key themes that emerged during client interactions at our recent Connect 2024 user conference was a notable shift in client openness to embrace cloud technology and a growing expectation among on-premises clients that they will migrate to the cloud. This shift is especially apparent in the state and federal market with our application platform and in the public safety market, where 90% of second quarter public safety contract value was SaaS compared to 13% a year ago. Primarily as a result of this accelerated shift in public safety cloud adoption, SaaS arrangements comprised 97% of our new software contract value in the second quarter. Additionally, we signed 111 flips of on-premises clients, including a number of larger clients, with the average ARR flips growing 21.8%. We also had a very successful go-live in May with the SaaS migration of the Idaho State Court system. This is our first flip to the cloud of a statewide court system, and Idaho went live just four months after the project kicked off. This high-profile migration has been watched closely by other statewide and large county courts and its successful execution is certainly a positive reference point as we engage with other large core clients about moving to the cloud. Key second quarter new SaaS deals and flips included a competitive win with the City of Topeka, Kansas for multiple integrated solutions, including enterprise ERP, enterprise permitting & licensing, enterprise asset management for nearly $700,000 in ARR. And ERP Pro and Payments contract with Richland County, Wisconsin, funded via ARPA funds. That was executed on an accelerated 90-day sales cycle, leveraging our enhanced sales enablement and competitive intel teams. The Idaho State Police signed a SaaS contract for our integrated enterprise public safety suite including CAD, records management and e-citations. This Tier 1 competitive win demonstrates our growing momentum with state public safety agencies and represents the sixth state police agency to adopt our enterprise public safety solutions. The United County, New York Department of Emergency Services also chose our integrated Public Safety Suite for 64 agency client-driven, SaaS deployment. Hunt County, Texas, upgraded to Enterprise Public Safety from our Public Safety Pro solution and Spotsylvania County, Virginia, signed a contract for our enforcement Mobile Solutions, joining eight of the 14 largest Virginia agencies using Tyler Public Safety applications. We signed an enterprise justice SaaS flip with Fulton County, Georgia, which includes Atlanta. The contract with ARR of $1.9 million follows Fulton County's Enterprise appraisal and tax SaaS flip signed in the first quarter, and includes integrated justice solutions such as prosecutor and jail as well as additional client management services under our unified One Tyler approach. We also signed an enterprise supervision expansion with the Arizona Supreme Court that builds on the success of adult probation to add juvenile probation for all 15 counties across the state. We leveraged the state relationship, which led to a five-year enterprise justice agreement with the Phoenix Municipal Court, representing in excess of $2.25 million in ARR. This strategic and highly competitive win includes five one-year extension options and paves the way for expansion and new court software opportunities in a large population state. Another theme coming out of Connect '24 was pronounced interest in AI and our expanded AI capabilities that were added through our 2023 acquisitions. High interest is turning into multiple new deals and cross-sell wins for our application platform, leveraging our augmented field operation solutions, formerly ARInspect with four inspection SaaS arrangements in the quarter across state, environmental, health and regulatory agencies. These included the California State Board of Pharmacy to configure and automate five regulatory inspection types, the Kentucky Department Environmental Protection, the New York Department of Health and the Arkansas Department of Labor and Licensing, which was a cross-sell win leveraging our Digital Solutions division state enterprise relationship. Another key to our growth strategy is expanding our differentiated payments business. And similar to our first quarter results, higher transaction volumes contributed to better-than-expected transaction revenues. In the second quarter, we signed 195 new payments deals across Tyler Software clients, representing approximately $8 million in projected ARR. In our state enterprise portal business, we secured extensions for our digital government and payment processing services under four state enterprise contracts, including Hawaii, New Jersey, Kansas and Kentucky and also won a sole source award with the state of Rhode Island as no extensions remained under the previous contract. We also signed a two-year renewal with the state of Illinois for our Outdoor and Enterprise Licensing Solutions. Now I'd like Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our updated annual guidance for 2024.
Brian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. Total revenues for the quarter were $541 million, up 7.3% and organically grew 6.5%. Subscriptions revenue increased 12.1% and organically rose 11.8%. Within subscriptions, our SaaS revenues grew 23.2% to $156 million and grew organically 22.5%. Keep in mind that there's often a lag from the signing of a new SaaS flip or SaaS deal or flip to the start of revenue recognition that can vary from one to several quarters. Because of this, as well as the timing of SaaS renewals and related price increases, SaaS revenue growth both year-over-year and sequentially may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Transaction revenues grew 3.8% to $177.7 million. Transaction revenues exceeded our plan, primarily due to higher transaction volumes from new and existing clients, including recreational licenses such as hunting and fishing, which begin their peak season during Q2. In addition, e-filing revenues grew 11.2%. The year-over-year comparison for transaction revenues continued to be impacted by the change in mid-2023 from the gross model to the net model for payments under one of our state enterprise agreements. This will no longer be a factor in year-over-year growth comparisons in the second half of the year, and our expectation is for mid- to high teens growth in transaction revenues in the second half of 2024. SaaS deals comprised approximately 97% of our Q2 new software contract value compared to 82% last year. During the quarter, we added 203 new SaaS arrangements and converted 111 existing on-premises clients to SaaS with a total contract value of approximately $127 million. In Q2 of last year, we added 170 new SaaS arrangements and had 94 on-premises conversions with total contract value of approximately $93 million. More importantly, the average ARR associated with our Q2 flips increased 21.8% over last year as larger clients such as Fulton and Clayton Counties in in Metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia; the cities of Tucson, Arizona and Birmingham, Alabama; and the Columbus, Ohio City schools flipped to the cloud, including transaction revenues, expansions with existing clients and professional services, total bookings increased 7.3% on an organic basis. Our total annualized recurring revenue was approximately $1.8 billion, up 8.4% and organically grew 7.8%. In previous quarters, we discussed our expectation that 2023 would be the operating margin trough from our cloud transition and that 2024 would mark a return to operating margin expansion. Our non-GAAP operating margin in the second quarter was 24.5%, up 150 basis points from last year. The margin expansion reflects improved margins from our cloud operations, along with expensive effective operating expense management and improving professional services margins. As we discussed on previous calls, merchant and interchange fees from our payments business under the gross revenue model have a meaningful impact on our overall margins as they are passed through to clients and are included in both revenues and cost of revenues. We incurred merchant fees of approximately $45 million in Q2. Because of strong earnings and effective working capital management, both cash flows from operations and free cash flow were above expectations for the quarter at $64.3 million and $48.6 million, respectively. Cash flow in the quarter was impacted by approximately $29 million of incremental cash taxes due to Section 174. We ended the quarter with $600 million of convertible debt outstanding and cash and investments of approximately $262 million. Our net leverage at quarter end was approximately 0.65x trailing 12-month pro forma EBITDA. Our updated 2024 annual guidance is as follows: We expect total revenues will be between $2.120 billion and $2.150 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 9%. We expect that merchant fees will be up approximately 6% over last year, and then implied organic growth, excluding merchant fees, would be approximately 20 basis points higher. We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be between $5.76 and $5.96 and may vary significantly due to the impact of discrete tax items on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $9.25 and $9.45. We expect our free cash flow margin will be between 18% and 20%, including an estimated impact of approximately $60 million of incremental cash taxes related to Section 174. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release and in the Q2 earnings deck posted on our website. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn.
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. Our exceptional performance in the first half of 2024 positions us well for a strong second half. We're pleased with our progress across all fronts as we remain on track with key initiatives around our four-pronged growth strategy while demonstrating our competitive strength and model durability. Our cloud transition is beginning to generate the expected benefits of margin improvement and enhanced client experience. As you know, in 2019, we launched a multiyear cloud strategy to shift our solutions and operations to a cloud-first business model, leading our clients to a future in the cloud. As we enter the next phase of our cloud journey, and as more new and existing clients embrace our cloud strategy, we see increasing opportunities to prove areas critical to our clients that ultimately affect client satisfaction, including product release cycles, product consistency, performance reliability and cost effectiveness. To effectively address these areas and lead this change, I'm pleased to share that Russell Gainford has been promoted to Chief Cloud Officer, effective immediately. Over the past three years, Russell has proven his ability to own the overall vision for Tyler's cloud-first strategy. And in his new capacity, he will continue to drive our cloud initiatives across our organization, including developing our cloud technology and operation standards, controls and business processes, overseeing our strategic business partner and vendor relationships as well as architecting the organizational design and staffing plans in collaboration with operational leaders. Shifting to capital allocation. Our disciplined approach bolsters our strong balance sheet as we've repaid our term debt during this period of higher interest rates. This coupled with our ability to consistently generate strong free cash flow provides tremendous flexibility to take advantage of opportunities to make investments that drive shareholder value, including product development, M&A and potentially stock buybacks. And while the bar is currently high for acquisitions, we continue to evaluate strategic tuck-in acquisitions, while building liquidity to be in a position to address our convertible debt maturity in March of '26. I'm also pleased to highlight that Tyler recently was recognized by two leading publications as we were included on Times list of America's best midsized companies and Forbes' Best Employers for Women's list. Before I close, I'd like to welcome our two new board members, Margot Carter and Andy Teed, who were elected at our May 9th Annual Meeting. Margot brings a wealth of experience in cloud software and SaaS transformations, AI and payments. She currently serves as President of Living Mountain Capital, where she invests in and advises companies and private equity firms on digital transformation and innovative strategies. She has an extensive background in finance M&A and corporate governance and has served on several public company boards. Andy is a seasoned technology executive with significant public sector experience. He currently serves as the CEO of Eco Parking Technologies, an integrated lighting and parking guidance company. Prior to that, Andy spent nearly 20 years at Tyler in various senior leadership roles. His extensive public sector experience and familiarity with our products and clients along with his knowledge of cloud technologies, make Andy a valuable addition to our Board. I also want to thank our two outgoing Board Directors, Dusty Womble and [Mary Landro] for their years of service and contributions to Tyler's success. Finally, I'd like to express my appreciation to our entire Tyler team for their hard work and continued commitment to driving growth while leading our clients on their digital modernization journeys. Our leadership is aligned with a unified focus on cloud living, and I've never been more confident in our prospects and Tyler's future. Now, we'd like to open the line for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Alexei Gogolev with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Alexei Gogolev: Thank you, Brian. Congratulations with great results. Brian, I was wondering the components of higher CapEx, what were they? If you could elaborate on that? And why are we seeing some decline in R&D? And does this have anything to do with your plans to reallocate certain R&D components? Remember, you were saying you were planning to do that for COGS going into OpEx?
Brian Miller: Those two are related, but they're not related to any reclassification of R&D. They're just interrelated in terms of as we perform different R&D projects. Some of them fall in the category of requiring capitalization and others are expensed. And sometimes, there's a -- and this just reflects a little bit of a shift between those two. So more of our development costs are being expensed and less being -- I'm sorry, more being capitalized and less are being expensed to R&D. So, it's just a shift between capitalization and expense based on the nature of the projects.
Alexei Gogolev: Understood. And then the second one about your AWS contract renewal. Could you elaborate on the potential benefits to gross margin and whether you think there will be a one-off benefit or you expect to unlock more discounts as you progress through the contract?
Lynn Moore: Yes, Alex, I think it's a couple of things. We did sign that long-term extension as we continue to commit more and more of our clients going into AWS and more and more spend each year, we do receive some additional discounts. So, I would expect those to continue. I think the other side is just -- is really just some of the operational efficiencies that we're starting to see the product optimization as we continue to optimize and move them into AWS version consolidation, the things that we've talked about. So, it's a number of factors, but I do expect looking forward that some of our gross margins would improve. I don't know that I would look -- I think as you look out over the next six, seven years, our Tyler 2030 vision, I would expect several of our gross margin lines to improve. I don't know that necessarily it's going to happen in the next 12 months, but we are making progress on all of those items.
Operator: Next question is from the line of Matt VanVliet with BTIG. Your line is now open.
Matt VanVliet: Continuing to have more success at the state level, curious how much of that's being driven by the integration sort of more holistically on the sales team with the NIC team and sort of some of those hunting licenses versus the product maturation and the acceptance of cloud at that level. And as you look on a go-forward basis, how much of these deals are having sort of multiproduct together to where the more, I guess, combined sales effort is paying off here?
Lynn Moore: Yes, Matt, it's a good point. We are seeing more momentum, certainly more cross-sell momentum in that state space. I think it's a testament to our DSD division's long-standing relationships and really our enhanced focus on leveraging those these last couple of years. There's things that we've done. We've talked about in the last couple of earnings calls around compensation and sales commissions and also executive leadership compensation that sort of try to break down some of those barriers and enhance those cross-sell opportunities. We are seeing more and more multiproduct deals. I think I referenced a few in my notes earlier. And that again, that's just -- it's a testament to what we've been -- what I've been sort of calling for the last couple of years, this vision of one Tyler operating more as a singular unified company, breaking down any sort of internal barriers that might have been just a slight hindrance in the past around cross sells and upsells. And I think we're starting to see that pay off as relationships are continuing to forge and as they start to become more and more productive.
Operator: Next question is from the line of Rob Oliver with Baird. Your line is now open.
Rob Oliver: Great. Lynn, my question is for you. Just a pretty rapid and somewhat stunning, I guess, I would say, having followed you guys a long time increase in public safety's willingness -- public safety’s customers willingness to adopt the cloud. And you guys clearly are right there to address that opportunity. I was just wondering this is one of the areas within core Tyler that has been historically the most competitive. And I think somewhat of a modest concern for investors. I was hoping you could address the extent to which this cloud move is really underscoring competitive advantages for you guys, perhaps the relationship with AWS as you take a sector of your market that historically was somewhat more reticent to move to the cloud, how that is helping you? And then as you look at that public safety pipeline where you see sort of current Tyler customers and where that cross-sell advantage might be?
Lynn Moore: Yes, you're right, Rob. Public safety has -- it's actually been a little bit surprising their results this year. At the end of last year and really coming into this year, we had made the decision that we were going to really lead our clients to the cloud sort of like the position we took across all of Tyler. And you're right, the momentum is there. Momentum is an interesting thing. And as you know, our clients talk and so I think right now, it is a competitive advantage for us. We are able to offer all of our core public safety products in a SaaS environment. That's not necessarily the case with all of our competitors. It's still a very competitive market. I like where we sit right now. I like some of our key wins or against some really key Tier 1 competitors, some that I mentioned in my remarks earlier, like Idaho State police deal. So, it's an interesting dynamic and one that I think is -- I talked earlier about momentum it is building momentum, and it's exciting to see. And I think we're also starting to see the impact of some of the cybersecurity concerns, which are -- they're heightened across all of our clients, but we've seen a number of flips. I think we had six flips in public safety in Q2. A couple of those were actually the result of some ransomware. And so being able to be nimble and stand up those clients very quickly, perhaps not with full functionality, but get them up and running where they can do their job has actually shown a lot of benefits and starting to give confidence to our clients and to their surrounding communities that the cloud is something that they should be looking at.
Operator: Next question is from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Michael Turrin: Great, looks like a strong Q2 for SaaS, fairly even split between new deals and conversions and the metrics. So, I was just hoping you could maybe speak to the drivers there. How you'd expect that mix between new deals and conversions likely trends. And if anything, seasonal in terms of Q2 and what we're looking at, we should be mindful of there?
Brian Miller: Yes. I don't think there's anything particularly seasonal around the pace of those, both the timing of new deals and especially the timing of flips can be a little bit lumpy. So, we certainly expect the trend to continue to be over the mid- and long term for the number of flips and the size of flips to continue to increase. That was one of the big factors this quarter was that the average ARR from flips this quarter was up almost 20%, and we highlighted some of those larger flips that are taking place. But I think in general, obviously, we're at a very high percentage of SaaS at 97% of the new business. I think public safety still will have some license deals in the second half of the year. And so that may even fall back a little bit. But the trend that Lynn just described is certainly continuing of greater acceptance of SaaS and public safety. So, I think you'll continue to see the flips trend upward, although they may bounce around a little bit from quarter to quarter and that the continuing -- the vast majority of our new deals coming in and SaaS will also continue.
Lynn Moore: Yes. I think, Michael, too, I think when you look at the numbers and compare quarter-over-quarter from last year, we've talked about the public sector market and how budgets are healthy and sales pipeline is strong. I think you're seeing that. We had I think if you look at our total new software deals, it's up about 11% year-over-year. Our flips are actually up about 18% and our new SaaS deals were up about 20%. Licenses, as Brian mentioned, are continuing to decline. I think licenses in Q2 were a little less than 1% of total revenues. And for the year, maybe a little less than 1.5% is what we're looking for the rest of the year. You're seeing the results of a good healthy market, and you're seeing the results of that market continuing to embrace SaaS and the cloud.
Operator: Next question is from the line of Charles Strauzer with CJS Securities. Your line is now open.
Charles Strauzer: Just looking at guidance for the back half of the year, is there anything abnormal that we should think about when modeling the cadence of the back half? Just anything [indiscernible] into our thinking here.
Brian Miller: I don't think there's a whole lot at a very high level, I think you'll continue to see revenue step up a bit from where they were in the second quarter, particularly around professional services, we'll continue to see grow a bit. SaaS will continue to see growth sequentially. I think the biggest growth in the second half will be, as you'd expect, SaaS revenues continue to step up quarter-to-quarter as more new customers come online and as we execute more flips and we get the impact of those revenues. The other revenue lines, I think generally, you'll see be fairly consistent with where they were in the second quarter across the third and fourth quarters. And dropping down to the bottom line, I think you'll see earnings generally in the same range that we see in the second quarter in the third and fourth quarters. And cash flow, certainly, the third quarter historically is by far our strongest cash flow quarter because of timing of maintenance collections and that will be the case as well.
Operator: Next question is from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Alex Zukin: I'm going to try to link a few threads and just throw something out there, which is it seems like your -- the flips are happening faster, they're larger. You're promoting somebody to run cloud full-time immediately. And so, I guess my question is, does it feel as though the value of that maintenance portfolio, the value of these flips given even the attach rate and the expanded portfolio of other services that you're cross-selling and the transactional revenues, is it just growing -- like if you look at the value of that pipeline, is it a lot larger than maybe what you were previously anticipating? And kind of how do you see that -- how should we think about that playing out in the P&L over the course of the next year or two?
Lynn Moore: Yes, Alex, I would say, I think in the last several quarters, we're actually starting to see a little bit more uplift than what we had expected. But I think what it does is when you step back and you look at our long-term Tyler 2030 goals, I'd say what's been happening over the last several quarters now as it's really validating what we've set out to do and what we said we're going to do. I would like to -- when you think about timing, one of the things we've constantly said is that as we look out to 2030, it won't be linear. But again, each quarter where I start to see some of these what I'm now calling momentums makes me feel even more confident about what we're doing and what we've set out to do.
Operator: Next question is from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Saket Kalia: Okay. Great and echo the nice results in the quarter. Brian, maybe my question is for you. I want to just talk about the payments business a little bit. I think you said mid- to high teens growth -- revenue growth in the second half, and you correct me there if I'm wrong. But is there a way that you think about kind of the payments business as sort of an equation, right, between kind of same-store sales growth plus sort of share gains? Or maybe said another way, kind of a net revenue retention in that business plus new logo. How do you think about sort of that equation, even anecdotally as part of that kind of mid- to high teens growth rate in the second half?
Brian Miller: Yes. I think, and obviously, the change from the sort of low single-digit growth in the first half to the mid- to high teens in the second half, mostly revolves around that, the impact of us lapping the gross to net change from one of our state contracts midyear last year. But if you break down that kind of high teens growth, I think, generally, sort of the -- and it's a high level, but the sort of the same same-store growth or the same customer growth is typically kind of high-single digits, maybe approaching 10%, but kind of in that range is how we think about it. Some of that around our Digital Solutions division state contracts where they either have higher transaction volumes or we add additional services in a state that drive more revenues with that same customer. And then the difference going up into the mid- to high teens is sort of our new customer growth, and that's really reflecting the impact of driving the payments platform into our local government customer base and attaching it to both new and existing software customers. And we've talked about those being higher margin, higher premium pricing kinds of engagements. And those are the ones we're talking about. For example, this quarter that added $8 million of new ARR from new payment customers in our -- associated with our software customers. So, that's kind of generally how we think about that split.
Lynn Moore: Yes. And I think when we think -- I think we outlined when we're looking out to Tyler 2030, we looked at transaction growth. It was really -- we're projecting long-term CAGR of sort of low double-digit growth. One of the things we're also seeing, Saket, is we've gotten a lot better at onboarding our clients. We're getting a lot more efficiencies there. And so, we're actually starting to get revenues recognized sooner. And then over time, to your point about sort of same-store sales is trying to drive further and further adoption across that client base is a significant driver.
Operator: Next question is from the line of Terrell Tillman with Truist. Your line is now open.
Terrell Tillman: I have one question and it'd almost be in two parts. So just bear with me. First, in terms of Idaho, congrats, Lynn, on the successful go-live. It sounded like four months, that's pretty strong. I'm curious though, you said this is an important milestone, I know you have some really large, on-prem or kind of private cloud customers in courts, but also maybe some that are more ready to move. How are you thinking about some of these other potential large, court flip opportunities, whether they're actionable this year or into next year? And then, Brian, just the second part of this question is, with CSI, ResourceX, ARInspect. I was intrigued last quarter because there were some big deals there. I think you said it was about a $4 million kind of quarterly run rate on those AI-based kind of solutions. Does that still hold? Or is it picking up from there?
Lynn Moore: Yes. Good question, Terry. On the Idaho SaaS flip, our courts -- there's only so many state court implementations out there. And so, getting the first one out there on time, live and referenceable was a pretty impressive feat by our people. And I'm going to make a little sidebar comment because we've talked about it before over the years. But I think one of the things that's really impressive about our teams is all the work that we do behind the scenes. We talk a lot about the numbers, but there's a lot of work that goes into getting these clients up and actionable, whether it's a SaaS flip or even just a new implementation, and our teams just did an incredible job. And as you know, this entire business is a reference business. And there were a lot of state courts who had inquired, have been asking about the SaaS flip, but they all were sort of keeping an eye on Idaho. So do I expect that to translate into other large, statewide SaaS flips or just other large court SaaS flips, I do. I'm not going to say that they're going to start happening in the month of September. But I think as you look out over the coming quarters, you'll start to see that momentum grow and build in that market?
Brian Miller: Yes. With respect to the three acquisitions from last year that have strong AI capabilities, they continue to perform really well in terms of the new business market, and they are continuing to grow. We highlighted last quarter a couple of large deals, and I think we mentioned a few of those this time as well. I think we've been really pleased with the speed at which those have started to contribute and we're able to leverage cross-sells. Of course, that's part of the thesis behind all of those acquisitions that we can leverage our existing sales organizations in our existing customer base and new deal opportunities to sell more of those newly acquired products. And I think we've been really pleased with the speed at which we've been able to execute on those and particularly CSI adding that to some of our large court deals. ResourceX already had some large client engagements, and we're continuing to see those come on board as well in ARInspect. We called out several state deals there this quarter. So those are all performing really well and contributing nicely kind of out of the box.
Lynn Moore: Yes, there's a lot of buzz for these out in the marketplace, Terry. And as Brian said, it's kind of twofold. On the one hand, it's a great playbook that we've run for many years, a tuck-in acquisition that we can get in the hands of our sales teams and get out to our installed base but also in areas like ResourceX, for example, I mean, it's a differentiator for us in our new enterprise ERP sales. So, it's both a competitive advantage in new sales but also a huge opportunity to deploy through our installed base.
Operator: Next question is from the line of Josh Reilly with Needham & Company. Your line is now open.
Josh Reilly: Just on the Dallas data center closure, can you just remind us in the income statement where the expenses for that data center lie? And what's the implication for our second half modeling with that shutting down? And then just secondarily, along the margin front, can you just give us some color on what drove the margin improvement in services?
Brian Miller: I'll take the first part of it. Most of the cost for the data center are up in cost of subscriptions. So, they're up in the gross margin line, there's also -- I mean there's depreciation, there's operating costs and there's some personnel costs. Those -- the first data center that closed, the Dallas data center is a colo facility. So, there's not a real estate impact there. So those costs will be part of our margin profile in the second half of the year. But also remind you that around the second data center, which we expect to close around the end of next year, the bubble costs or the duplicate costs of running that data center and incurring costs in AWS as we migrate customers out, those costs continue to increase until they go away because we continue to move more customers out of that data center as we progress towards its closure. The impact of the closing of the first data center is somewhat offset by the ongoing impact of the second data center. And then we'll get a bigger bump at the end of -- after that data center closes in '25. So again, I think overall, I think operating margins are probably pretty consistent in the second half of the year with where they are here in Q2.
Lynn Moore: Yes, I'd say -- I'd add to that, Josh. One of the things that's gratifying to me is we outlined this vision of closing the data centers a couple of years ago, and we're basically hit it on track. And that takes a lot of work by a lot of people. And again, it continues to validate some of the things that we've outlined a couple of years ago as we started our cloud transformation. So that's gratifying to see. The other obvious upside of getting out of the Dallas data center and eventually out of the [indiscernible] data center is all the future CapEx savings. We would spend a lot of money over the next five, seven years, adding to those capabilities had we not done that. Your question on pro services gross margins, it's a couple of things. I would say, one, it's been an enhanced focus, sort of a top-down focus from the management team over the last year plus. It's something that we're dissecting and continue to dissect and look at things around really focusing on those gross margins, utilization, things like that. The other thing that's been driving it is we're starting to see a little more stability in our workforce, and we've been seeing that for several quarters. So turnover is a lot lower. And in the Pro Services area, when you experience elevated turnover, which we did coming out of COVID, we did during sort of that period post COVID when people were transferring out and going through -- the grass is always greener. It's tough because it takes a long time to get people trained, up to speed and get to a point where they can be out in the field and be billable. And so, I think it's part of what we're seeing overall in the labor market. But having that return of more stability and more consistent, historical Tyler turnover levels is certainly helping. But it's also been an enhanced focus from the management team.
Brian Miller: I think the ongoing move to the cloud helps us there as well because in a general sense, we're able to deploy software more efficiently in the cloud. And version consolidation helps us as well to some extent there on both services and support.
Lynn Moore: And to that point, Brian, I guess, remote delivery of services, it's something we really started around COVID and clients continue to have more and more acceptance of that delivery model.
Operator: Next question is from the line of Peter Heckmann with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.
Peter Heckmann: Most of my questions have been answered. I just wanted to follow up on the NIC transaction and just see if you're seeing any changes in terms of those self-funded, state-level IT portal deals. If the states are looking for something different, something more and then just curious about the -- it looks like you had good renewal activity here in the first half. But do you -- I guess, what's your perception of other states migrating to that self-funded portal model in the future? Or do you think it's more likely that you do something more on an agency-by-agency basis at the state level?
Lynn Moore: Well, it's a little bit of both. Peter, the state-funded model is what old NIC now DSD grew up with. And there's -- I think there's going to be continued demand for that type of model as budgets are constrained. We talked about it, last quarter the significant deal we signed with -- last quarter, quarter before the California State Parks, which that deal could not have happened. It's the largest contract in Tyler's history, and that deal could not have happened absent the self-funded model. I do think you're going to -- we're also going to continue to see more and more agency by agency. That's part of our strategy, getting more products in on a targeted agency basis that's probably more aligned with the more historical Tyler model. We've done some things internally over the last couple of quarters really consummated in the last year. We've done an internal realignment between our Platform Solutions division and our Digital Solutions division so that we can take advantage of both of those opportunities, align our sales teams, eliminate some overlap but really start to drive both types of sales as we go forward.
Operator: Next question is from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Your line is now open.
Jonathan Ho: Can you give us a little bit of additional color about your thoughts around cybersecurity and what this could potentially mean in terms of either upsell opportunities or accelerated transition to the cloud? Just want to get a sense for how much this is sort of impacting the industry as a whole.
Lynn Moore: Yes, Jonathan. I mean, as we know, it's a reality. We always say it's even -- it's not a matter of if, it's when. And cybersecurity event has certainly impacted both our clients and other public sector agencies that aren't our clients. It is a natural opportunity to accelerate discussions around moving to the cloud and flipping to the cloud. We've had a number of those. We don't necessarily -- I talked about a couple of public safety that happened last quarter. I don't really like to highlight them too much. but that's -- it's a reality that's going on in the market. And one of the things that I think we're getting better at is as we're flipping clients to the cloud for whatever reason but certainly in the cyber -- as a result, cybersecurity is, it is an opportunity to get them more modern and add some more products in the mix. So again, it's out there. we're all dealing with it. And our goal really is to be as responsive to our clients as possible, and we've gotten better. I've mentioned at public safety -- we've also gotten better about being able to stand up clients really quickly, maybe not with the full functionality that they might have had in an on-premise system out of the box but enough to get them going, which also gives us an opportunity to sort of reevaluate all of their requirements and potentially upsell other items. And so yes, it's just out there.
Operator: Next question is from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Your line is now open.
Kirk Materne: Yes. Congrats on the quarter. Lynn, I was wondering, on the public safety side, when customers are now flipping in a bigger way towards cloud, how does that change the competitive environment for you? Meaning, I'd imagine there are a lot of smaller competitors that don't necessarily either have the scale on the cloud side or potentially or as advanced as you all, is that leading to better, I guess, win rates in that particular segment of your business as well?
Lynn Moore: Yes. I think, Kirk, it's certainly a competitive differentiator right now. And I think we've seen this historically across different business lines. There's always times when competitors sort of make a move and then we make a move. I'd say right now, I like where we sit with public safety. We have the most comprehensive offering. We have the most comprehensive offering that can be deployed in the cloud. There are some smaller players who certainly have some cloud-native offerings but may not have the depth of functionality and may not really be good candidates for some of these larger deals and whether or not their ability to execute on it. What's been impressive, I think over the last 18 months or so -- 12, 18 months at public safety is the execution on this strategy. It's a shift in mindset for that sales team, it's a shift in mindset for all the operational teams and messaging that out to the market, it's resonating, and it's something that's exciting to see. I remember a couple of years ago talking about how it could be several years, maybe five, six years before we were even at 50% SaaS levels at public safety. And it just shows you that the changing dynamics in the market. And fortunately, we've been in a position through some of the work we've done over the years to not only capitalize on it but also help lead it.
Operator: Next question is from the line of Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Kelly Galanis: This is Kelly Galanis on for Gabriela. Congrats on the quarter as well. Given that a lot of your customers are now kind of on a new fiscal year, can you share some early observations on what customer budgets are looking like this year relative to last year? And then, how much of this stronger demand that you're seeing is tied to these healthy budgets versus kind of just demand for cloud and these other the factors you're talking about.
Lynn Moore: Yes. I don't know that -- yes, we -- for a lot of our clients are on June 30 fiscal year. But I don't know that we necessarily have significant insight in those budgets. They're pretty steady. They're pretty healthy. Most of our sales procurement cycles are multiple years long or certainly long, not all multiple years but they tend to be lengthy. I think -- I'm sorry, I lost my more train of thought there. So yes, I think the budgets are healthy right now. And I think our win rates are good. One of the things that I've -- we have noticed this year is, I think, probably a leading indicator is when you look across our product lines, all of the indicators are still strong. And really, most of our divisions, almost all of our products are either at or above sort of what their sales projection was for the year in terms of being midyear. So that's a good tailwind as we look out over the next several quarters. And right now, we're not seeing any -- certainly no negative changes in the public sector budgets.
Brian Miller: Yes. And I think the other -- the other side of that strong demand is this increasing desire for digital modernization, and it's really how governments increasingly do -- address doing more with less resources. So, to the extent that they have really struggling with understaffing, a lot of workers left the public sector space during COVID and in general, government has not rebuilt its workforce. So, they're trying to perform these essential services with staffing constraints and really turning to technology as how they do that. So I think it's a little bit even more than just the traditional replacing a 20-year-old system that's at end of life and is dying but being more strategic about it and saying, okay, the new technology will help me do the things I have to do with either the budget or the personnel constraints that I'm forced to deal with.
Operator: Next question is from the line of Mark Schappel with Loop Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Mark Schappel: Nice job on the quarter. John, question for you in your prepared remarks, you noted continued progress you're making around your product version consolidation efforts. Just wondering if you could elaborate on the progress you made during the quarter on that front and also what we can expect maybe in the coming quarters here.
John Marr: Yes, sure, Mark, obviously, version consolidation has been a big part of what I've been calling sort of Phase 1 of our cloud transformation. Phase 1 is selecting AWS. It's a product optimization, it's version consolidation. It's the flips, it's exiting the data centers. Version consolidation is critical for a lot of reasons. One is we need to get down to a single product. We need to get down to a cloud release. We need to get our clients up-to-date on the modern versions. Otherwise, they're not really going to be flipping the cloud. That's part of the foundation for that. We don't really go I don't know that you see necessarily quarter-by-quarter progress, but you see goals that are being hit and attained. Anecdotally, for example, in our enterprise ERP division, which is formerly our munis product we now have about 95% of our clients down on a single version, whereas a couple of years ago, there were several versions with maybe hundreds of clients on different types of versions. So that's significant progress that's been made, and it's a focus across all of our divisions and all of our operating units, and they're making similar progress.
Operator: Thank you for your question. There are no additional questions waiting at this time. So, I'll pass the call back to Lynn Moore for any closing remarks.
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Matt. And thanks, everybody, for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Brian Miller or myself. Thanks, everybody. Have a great day.
Operator: That concludes the conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-04-25 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to today's Tyler Technologies First Quarter 2024 Conference Call. Your host for today's call is Lynn Moore, President and Chief Executive Officer of Tyler Technologies. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, April 25, 2024. 
 I would like to turn the call over to Hala Elsherbini, Tyler's Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Hala Elsherbini: Thank you, Christa, and welcome to our call. With me today is Lynn Moore, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. After I give the safe harbor statement, Lynn will have some initial comments on our quarter and then Brian will review the details of our results and update our annual guidance for 2024. Lynn will end with some additional comments, and then we'll take your questions.  
 During this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information and may include projections concerning the company's future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projections. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Also, in our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry.  
 A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We have also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financials tab, schedules with supplemental information, including information about our quarterly recurring revenues and bookings. On the Events and Presentations tab, we posted an earnings summary slide deck to supplement our prepared remarks. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Lynn? 
H. Moore: Thanks, Hala. Our first quarter results provided an exceptional start to the year, exceeding our expectations across key metrics, including revenues, earnings, operating margin and cash flow. Recurring revenues grew almost 9% and comprised 84% of our total revenues. SaaS revenues grew 22%, our 13th consecutive quarter of SaaS revenue growth of 20% or more, exceeding expectations of a 20% CAGR in SaaS revenues through 2025. In addition, transaction revenue surpassed our plan with higher volumes and positive pricing trends.  
 Our performance demonstrates the power of our business model against the backdrop of robust public sector demand, supported by generally healthy budgets. Our leading sales activity indicators remain elevated, and our pipeline reflects growing sales synergies as we execute our integrated go-to-market strategy.  
 During our Investor Day last year, we announced our Tyler 2030 Vision, which aligns our strategic focus on 4 key growth drivers: leveraging our installed base, expanding into new markets, completing our cloud transition, and growing our payments business.  
 Leveraging our unmatched installed base has been a cornerstone of our growth strategy, and we're pleased with the outstanding execution by our sales organization, driving impactful cross-sell and upsell activity that further deepens existing client relationships and expands our market reach with new client engagements. Notable cross-sell and upsell wins during the quarter included a records management and ERP pro contract, including payments with Ada County, Idaho, leveraging our state enterprise relationship. And on-premises contract, for our full enterprise Public Safety suite with the City of Columbus, Georgia, adding to its existing Tyler courts, corrections, ERP, tax and permitting solutions.  
 An enterprise ERP win with the Texas Legislative Council facilitated by our existing Digital Solutions division relationship in Texas, which avoided an RFP process to secure a new enterprise ERP client in a nontraditional market. A combined SaaS contract with the city of Juneau, Alaska, for enterprise assessment and tax and enterprise permitting and licensing solutions. By prioritizing the cloud as one of our key growth drivers, we are unlocking new levels of innovation and responsiveness in making the cloud accessible for our clients, while providing enhanced security. Our new software SaaS mix continue to expand and comprised 93% of Q1 new software contract value. 
 We're particularly encouraged to see a growing preference for cloud technology in the state and federal market with our application platform and an accelerated shift in Public Safety cloud demand with multiple client-driven SaaS selections. In fact, 75% of our first quarter enterprise Public Safety deals were SaaS. Because the pace of the shift to SaaS in these markets this year is faster than we previously anticipated, we have lowered our expectations for license revenues for the year. And across Tyler, the volume of flip signed in the first quarter was in line with our expectations, with a 21.5% increase in average ARR.  
 Key first quarter new SaaS deals and flips included multiyear SaaS arrangements with the Hawaii Department of Natural Resources and land between the Lakes National Recreation area that build on our momentum in the outdoor recreation space. Competitive SaaS wins for Public Safety included a full enterprise Public Safety suite contract with Palm Beach, Florida, which was focused on a cloud-only strategy. We also won a sole-source enterprise Public Safety contract with the city of Evanston, Illinois, which expands our growing footprint in the Chicagoland area. An enterprise appraisal in tax for Fulton County, Georgia, which includes Atlanta. The contracts with ARR of more than $1 million was executed on accelerated timeline with a go-live completed within 1 month. Two Public Safety SaaS flips with Beringham, Alabama and Germantown, Tennessee, both of which were client-driven SaaS selections and accelerated go-lives. The Kansas judicial branch signed an enterprise justice appellate court SaaS flip as we continue to see a growing interest in moving to the cloud from our on-premises courts clients.  
 Another key driver of our long-term growth is our transactions and payments business. As I mentioned earlier, better-than-expected transaction volumes contributed to first quarter revenues that exceeded our expectations. In the first quarter, we signed 288 new payments deals across Tyler, representing approximately $9 million in projected ARR. In our state enterprise portal business, we signed a new 3-year enterprise contract with the State of Mississippi, extending our existing 14-year relationship. Our enterprise agreement with the State of Idaho was also renewed for 2 years in a rebid through the NASPO Citizen Engagement agreement.  
 We're also very pleased to see early traction and growing demand for the solutions we added to our portfolio through our 2023 acquisitions of CSI, ARInspect and RexourceX, each of which brought us expanded AI capabilities. With CSI, we signed a contract with our existing course client in Dallas County, Texas, adding approximately $900,000 of ARR. We've seen demo activity double over pre-acquisition levels for our augmented field operation solution, formerly ARInspect, with first quarter wins that included the city of Newark manhole inspections and an expansion contract with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.  
 For our priority-based budgeting solution powered by RexourceX, we signed contracts with Collier County, Florida and Fort Worth, Texas that added almost $600,000 of ARR.  
 Now I'd like Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our updated annual guidance for 2024. 
Brian Miller: Lynn, total revenues for the quarter were $512.4 million, up 8.6% and organically grew to 7.8%. Subscriptions revenue increased 11.7% and organically rose 11.4%. Within subscriptions, our SaaS revenues grew 22% to $148.8 million and grew organically 21.3%. Keep in mind that there's often a lag from the signing of a new SaaS deal or a flip to the start of revenue recognition that can vary from one to several quarters. Because of this, as well as the timing of SaaS renewals and related price increases, SaaS revenue growth, both year-over-year and sequentially may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter.  
 Transaction revenues grew 3.7% to $164.5 million. While transaction revenues exceeded our plan, primarily due to higher transaction volumes from new and existing clients, including driver history records, the year-over-year comparison continues to be impacted by the change last year from the gross model to the net model for payments under one of our state enterprise agreement. SaaS deals comprised approximately 93% of our Q1 new software contract value compared to 87% last year.  
 During the quarter, we added 200 new SaaS arrangements and converted 90 existing on-premises SaaS clients -- on-premises clients to SaaS with a total contract value of approximately $86 million. In Q1 of last year, we added 145 new SaaS arrangements and had 73 on-premises conversions with a total contract value of approximately $86 million. More importantly, the average ARR associated with our Q1 flips increased 21.5% over last year. Including transaction revenues, expansions with existing clients and professional services, total bookings increased 15.7% on an organic basis.  
 Our total annualized recurring revenue was approximately $1.72 billion, up 8.8% and organically grew 8.2%. In previous quarters, we discussed our expectation that 2023 would be the operating margin trough from our cloud transition and that 2024 would mark a return to operating margin expansion. Our non-GAAP operating margin in the first quarter was 23.8%, up 210 basis points from last year. The margin expansion reflects improved margins for our cloud operations along with effective operating expense management. As we discussed on previous calls, merchant and interchange fees from our payments business under the gross revenue model, have a meaningful impact on our overall margins as they are passed through to clients and are included in both revenues and cost of revenues. We paid merchant fees of approximately $42 million in Q1. 
 Both cash flows from operations and free cash flow were above expectations for the quarter at $71.8 million and $57.2 million, respectively, which allowed us to repay the remaining $50 million of term debt outstanding from the NIC acquisition earlier in the year than planned.  We ended the quarter with $600 million of convertible debt outstanding and cash and investments of approximately $202 million. Our net leverage at quarter end was approximately 0.79x trailing 12-month pro forma EBITDA with our only remaining debt of $600 million convertible due in 2026. 
 Our updated 2024 annual guidance is as follows. We expect total revenues will be between $2.110 billion and $2.140 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 8.5%. We now expect that merchant fees will be up slightly over last year and that implied organic growth, excluding merchant fees, would be approximately 50 basis points higher. We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be between $5.27 and $5.47 and may vary significantly due to the impact of discrete tax items on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $9.10 and $9.30. We expect to see sequential growth in earnings throughout the year with both revenues and EPS slightly weighted towards the second half. We expect our free cash flow margin will be between 17% and 19%, including the estimated impact of approximately $58 million of incremental cash taxes related to Section 174. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release and in the Q1 earnings deck posted on our website.  
 Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn. 
H. Moore: Thanks, Brian. Our performance in the quarter demonstrates strong execution by team members across Tyler in key strategic areas, anchored to our Tyler 2030 Vision. We are starting to see the expected benefits of our cloud transition through progress with version consolidation, cloud optimization of products, cost efficiencies and improved agility as we empower our clients who serve the public through Tyler's next-generation cloud applications.  
 Our strong first quarter results and positive outlook for the remainder of the year are reflected in our revised annual guidance. Even with lower expectations for license revenues because of the accelerated shift to SaaS with our Public Safety and application platform solutions, we've raised our revenue guidance while also increasing our earnings outlook.  
 We recently published our 2023 corporate responsibility report, our fifth annual sustainability disclosure covering our environmental, social and governance activities. Our sustainability initiatives in 2023 included investments in data management, validation and processes to drive reporting efficiencies. We also undertook a double materiality assessment to understand key insights for multiple constituents on both financial materiality and impact materiality. We hope you take the time to review our report, which is available on our website.  
 Finally, we're excited about Tyler Connect 2024, which will take place May 19 to 22 in Indianapolis. Nearly 5,000 Tyler clients and 900 Tyler team members will come together for training, collaboration and networking, and we're looking forward to inspiring our clients with the latest innovations from Tyler.  
 Now we'd like to open the line for Q&A. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Rob Oliver from Baird. 
Robert Oliver: Lynn, mine is for you. You mentioned in the outset of your prepared remarks, kind of your growth focus areas, but you talked about the kind of growing sales synergies and the integrated go-to-market strategy that you guys laid out in more detail last year. And I know this has been a big push of your since you assumed the CEO role. Could you give us a little bit of color on kind of what if some of those growing sales synergies are? Where you're excited about the progress you've had so far? What some of the levers you're pulling are? And what are some areas you still need to improve on? I appreciate it. 
H. Moore: Yes. Sure, Rob. It's a good question. Last year, we elevated a couple of people to oversee all of our public admin sales, all of our justice sales. They're working more closely together than ever before. We've done things around aligning some incentive comp plans and changing the way people are comped to make sure that, for example, it's -- in the old days, it's well -- whose P&L is this recognized by. And we wanted to break down some of those barriers so that really, when -- it's all about Tyler, when Tyler wins, everybody wins. And so we've been doing things like that. We've done some things, and we're still in the process of -- and some of that's still work-in-progress. 
 I mean when I say that we started these initiatives, they're not by any means finished, but these are things that are work-in-progress. We're doing things around our PSD and DSD divisions, our application platform and formerly NIC, we see a lot of synergies there. So we're doing things right now to start to bring some of those divisions closer together so that they can work more closely with sales and operating efficiencies. We believe the application platform is tailor-made for state government. And so just a number of initiatives like that. It's -- there's a lot going on. And I think we're going to continue to see improvement as we look out forward. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays. 
Saket Kalia: Lynn, the numbers are pretty straightforward. So maybe I'll ask just a little bit of a higher level question. It sounds like just the spending backdrop in state and local governments continues to sound healthy. But just to make sure the question is asked, can you talk about, Lynn, what you've seen historically from those customers in presidential election years? I mean I imagine that those 2 things aren't terribly related. But again, I just want to ask -- I want to make sure that question is asked as we kind of get deeper into election season. 
H. Moore: Yes, I don't know that historically, there's been much of a correlation between our sales and the presidential election year more so than what may be going on in the broader macroeconomic environment. As you note, the budgets for our clients are healthy and strong. Our sales outlook for the year, and we have some pretty aggressive sales plans, but our sales outlook for the year are looking on plan and significant parts of our business actually, may be ahead of plan. Maybe a little bit in the federal space. I don't know that I've got enough experience yet with our federal space as to what impact that may have. But it's normally more so around what's going on with the federal funding and budgets. But I think generally, in our -- if you look at our traditional local and state space, I haven't seen a lot of change in my 25 years plus. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt VanVliet from BTIG. 
Matthew VanVliet: I said you continue to see a higher and higher mix of business going to set contracts and I believe even see an acceleration to a certain extent on the flips side [indiscernible] Public Safety or maybe holding you back [indiscernible] the case for or, I guess, impetus to try to push forward on more flips, maybe encouraged customers at a little bit more of an accelerated pace to move over and just try to get this done with sort of as quickly as possible? Or any changing in your thinking there of the motivation of customers? 
H. Moore: And you're kind of cutting out, I think I got most of your question, Matt. I'll start. Brian, you can certainly jump in. At Public Safety, I think it's a couple of things. I think actually, as you step back and you go back to 2019, when we sort of announced that we were going to go cloud-first from cloud agnostic, some of the message was we were going -- at least internally was we were going to take our leadership position and start leading the market to where we thought it was going to go and needed to go. In Public Safety, as you know, historically, it's been a little bit slower. We've spent a couple of years. We've got some new leadership Public Safety. Our position in Public Safety is we're very competitive. It's a competitive space, but we're in a very competitive space and a place, excuse me. 
 And really starting this year and started more so third quarter, fourth quarter last year, we've taken the approach that we are going to start leading with SaaS with Public Safety. And so that's resonating. We talked about the Palm Beach, Florida contract. That was a deal where they were only looking for a SaaS arrangement. As we look out this year, we're going to continue to do things to push things quicker to SaaS. At the end of the day, it's still the customer's choice. There's a lot of selling things around that. You look at our Public Safety, I think our plan for the year was to do about 50% on-prem licenses, give or take, which was up significantly from last year. And what we're seeing right now, I think we reported 75% in Q1. 
 As it relates to flips, there's a lot of selling messages generally around flips and where all our sales folks are armed with those. I think one thing that you're also starting to see, and we've talked about it before on earnings calls is the continued rise of cybersecurity and ransomware attacks are also sort of triggering clients to want to push to SaaS faster. And the more that they see that out in their community, which aren't always publicized, I think that's also sort of starting to grease the wheels a little bit to make that decision to move to SaaS. 
Brian Miller: I guess, the only thing I'd add to that is, in terms of our ability to significantly increase, the pace of flips beyond the sales efforts that Lynn talked about. We have talked about in the past the need for clients who aren't on the current version of our products generally to upgrade to that version either before or when they look to the cloud as we drive towards having one version of each product in the cloud. And we've made a lot of progress with version consolidation and sunsetting old versions and moving clients along, but that continues to be a gating factor in the pace of flips. 
 And so as we continue to make progress with that, it opens up more opportunities from clients being in a position to flip. But as we've talked about, especially as we move into the larger flips, they're complicated processes from a planning perspective. And so the timing leading up to the flip from the time we start engaging with clients, sometimes can be kind of lengthy. So we're certainly pushing it as fast as possible. We've talked about a road map that varies by product, but across all of our products, converges on us being at 80%, 85% of our on-prem customer base having moved to the cloud by 2030, and all of our business units have road maps that are aligned with that goal. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Wong from Oppenheimer. 
Hoi-Fung Wong: This one for you, Lynn. When we look at the number of subscription contracts, it looks like it took a really big step up this quarter. I think you touched on some of the highlights. Just wondering if that's more of a kind of a lumpy volatile seasonality type of a situation we're seeing there from the jump up to 200? Or do you think that, that is perhaps a closer reflection of the run rate we can expect going forward? 
H. Moore: It's probably a little bit of both. I think one -- obviously, with 200 new deals are going to vary in size and scope. But if you step back generally, when I think about 200 new contracts a year -- a quarter, that plays out to over 800 a year. That's a lot of business we're doing, and that's a lot of business we're executing on. It's great work by our sales teams. It's great work by our ProServe teams to then turn that into revenue. But I think it's -- I don't know that that's the new -- it's certainly higher than it was coming out of Q4 last year and most of last year. I think last year, we did about 750 new deals, give or take for the year. So we're on pace a little better. But as I said, right now, markets are healthy, budgets are strong. Our sales outlook, all indicators are positive and our sales outlook looks good for the year. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alexei Gogolev of JPMorgan. 
Alexei Gogolev: Considering the elevated level of demand that Lynn, you just referred to, has your win rate remained relatively consistent at around 50%? And if it has, it feels like you should be taking more market share. Do you feel that you could show acceleration of organic revenue growth in the near term? 
H. Moore: Yes. Thanks, Alexei. I'd say, generally, our win rates across the board are consistent. And when you say 50%, that's -- you got to look by each sort of major products. So there's certainly some areas where our win rates are 80%, 85%, some that are more competitive spaces, we talk about Public Safety, we talk about sort of the mid- to higher ERP space where there's -- it's a lot more competitive market, and they may sort of be around there. So those really haven't changed. There's still -- we still have some of the same lag factors that we talked about before between time of getting a deal to contract to getting them up and running. But yes, I mean, we -- as we look out, we've -- our overall revenue growth sort of slowed over the last 2 years, and I think we've said we expect that to pick back up, and we're starting to see some of that. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Reilly from Needham & Company. 
Joshua Reilly: So we're hearing some of your venture-backed start-up competitors in Public Safety, specifically records management are having challenges getting customers live. Are you using this as an opportunity to go back to these customers and highlight the Tyler value proposition? And then just more broadly, how often have you seen this across other product lines where some of the venture-backed start-ups are making promises about getting customers live on timelines that they are unable to execute on? 
H. Moore: Yes, Joshua, that's a good question. And it's something we've seen, I'd say, really, over the 25-plus years I've been at Tyler. There's always seems to be little periods where someone comes up, makes little splash, they have a little spotlight on them. They certainly have a demo that looks good. They wouldn't have the depth of functionality and products that we've had because they haven't been in the space for as long as we have, but they win some business, but that's only part of the battle. We've always said part of Tyler secrets sauce is not just winning the business, but executing on the business. And it's hard stuff. Take, for example, our municipal and schools division, which really sells more on the low end of ERP and has some courts and things like that. 
 They did, I think, last year -- I mean last quarter, they did 207 go-lives in 1 quarter. Now obviously, that's a -- those are small deals, but that's a lot of business. And that's the hard part. And people, I think, from the outside, generally sort of look at Tyler's results and say, boy, this is an easy business. This business is something we ought to invest in and get into. And what we found, not just with venture-backed, but some PE money that's come in, is they didn't really understand the market, and it's a lot more difficult than it may look at times from the outside. And it's a testament to all our hardworking people at Tyler, it's testament to our culture, it's a testament how we view our relationships with our clients. So no, it's -- I appreciate you bringing that up because it's not something we spend a lot of time talking about. But it's -- you're only successful as your last implementation in this business and all our clients talk. So when you fail, everybody knows. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Clarke Jeffries from Piper Sandler. 
Clarke Jeffries: Brian, very encouraging to see operating margins up substantially, and operating income dollars up 19% year-over-year. You talked about improved cloud operations as a driver of that. Does that mean that some of the capacity in the private cloud is already being reduced? And you're taking up EPS today, but could you talk a little bit about the expectations for full year, how operating margins pan out for the rest of the year? 
Brian Miller: Yes. It's not so much of the capacity. We do continue to move clients to AWS, and we are on track with our plans to evacuate our first data center midyear of this year. But really, that -- a lot of those costs don't go out until after that data center is closed. So that's not really the biggest factor. Some of the things driving those improved cloud efficiencies are the releases we've had over recent quarters of the cloud optimized versions of our product, which improves the efficiencies and lowers our hosting costs at AWS. The progress we've made with version consolidation, and we made significant progress last year and continue to have aggressive plans this year about sunsetting older versions of products and getting the benefits from both support costs and development costs around the expenses associated with supporting multiple versions of multiple products.
 And the new AWS agreement that we talked about last quarter has provided us with increased efficiencies or increased cost efficiencies around our hosting costs. So  all of those are continuing to play out. And then on the revenue side, the outperformance in terms of revenues, especially on the payment side, where we were able to cover fixed costs in a better way with incremental revenues from things like driver history records above our plan that contributed there. And then lastly, we mentioned briefly, but continue to have effective expense management of OpEx. So both sales and marketing and G&A costs are growing at a slower rate than our than our overall revenues. So we're getting efficiencies there and those factor into the rest of the year as well. 
H. Moore: Yes. Clarke, I'd add, we are seeing efficiencies through the cloud, but there's still a runway to go in the efficiencies that we're going to achieve. And there's some other internal initiatives, we don't talk a lot about, things like improving our gross margins on pro services. We've seen -- we saw an uptick of that in Q1. That's really a function of a few different things. It's more of -- it's a strategic focus that we started working on last year. But it's also a function of that we've had a more stable labor market. Our turnover has been much lower and sort of returned back to pre-COVID levels. And that really helps. It helps drive billable utilization.  Other internal initiatives around things like rationalization of some internal IT costs and real estate costs. Things that we've been working on behind the scenes are all starting to show some results in addition to the cloud. But I want to emphasize that the efficiencies that we're going to see from further version consolidation and optimization and all the things that we're going to do in the cloud are still out there for us to go capture. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo Securities. 
Michael Turrin: Maybe on transaction revenue, the prepared materials mentioned a customer change from gross to net.  Would be curious on the rationale there, whether that's something we could see other customers elect for? And Brian, maybe you can just walk through both the margin impacts for us to consider there as well as the increased growth guide. Fast start came up a couple of times on the call, but if there's any supporting commentary on what's driving that, also helpful. 
Brian Miller: Sure. Yes, last year, and we talked about this some last year, we actually had 2 clients last year, state enterprise clients that had changes from the gross to the net model. And still, the vast majority of our payments business is on the gross model, and we expect that to continue to be the case. So we really don't see sort of large-scale changes like that ahead. It is a client decision. Most of our clients prefer the certainty and predictability they get from having a growth arrangement with us, where we're responsible for the merchant fees and interchange fees and bear the risk of the fluctuation of those. And -- so most of our clients prefer that. 
 These two clients, one changed towards the beginning of the year. The one that's still impacting our comparisons changed midyear last year, and they had roughly between $4 million and $5 million, a quarter of merchant fees associated with that account. So it will impact us in terms of our comparison for the first half of this year, and then it will lap itself and it won't be a factor. So as a result, our growth in transaction revenues because of that impact, and again, an impact on revenues, it actually improves margins by going to the gross model and the merchant fees for the first half of the year will just be up -- or transaction fees for the first half of the year, grow in the low single digits. But the second half of the year, we expect low to mid-teens when that impact has lapped. But again, I don't see that as a real trend going forward, but it is a client decision on an individual basis and different clients have different approaches to the risk they're willing to take and whether they're willing to manage those and pay those merchant interchange fees directly themselves. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho from William Blair. 
Jonathan Ho: Just wanted to maybe understand a little bit better the progress that you're seeing, I guess, adding more transaction-based systems to your existing customers. Can you give us a sense of how penetrated you are in terms of those transaction systems? And whether you're sort of on plan or on track in terms of adding more content to these existing contracts? 
H. Moore: Yes, that's a good question, Jonathan. I don't have those numbers just off here off the top of my head, we certainly can get back to you with those. I would say that generally speaking, we got a long runway left. We're still pretty early in our transactions business. You can point to our presentation at Tyler 2030 for how we saw transactions revenue to grow and the cash flow from that over the next 5 to 6 years. 
Brian Miller: Yes. We're still in the very early stages, very early innings of driving that cross-sell. We've done a lot of work with integrating the payments platform into our software products that have significant payments capabilities, things like utility billing and traffic court and licensing and permitting. And then as Lynn talked about earlier, the initiatives we've had to -- that in place more effective cross-selling sales motions. And we're starting to see the impact of that with, I think, we see 288 new payments deals across Tyler's customer base, but it's a very small fraction that we've penetrated so far of our software customer base with our payments platform, and that continues to build momentum, and we're really pleased with -- I'd say we're at least on track with our plans for this year. But again, in the very early innings of that. 
H. Moore: Yes. And I'd add to that, Jonathan. I mean, last -- I guess, now 2 years ago, we acquired Rapid Financial, which is the disbursements world. We are -- we barely scratched the surface with that. So still a lot to do on both sides. I would say if you look -- again, point you to our 2030 presentation, I'd say we're kind of on track right now for that. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Keith Housum from Northcoast Research. 
Keith Housum: I want to unpack a comment you made earlier in terms of cybersecurity as a driver of public agencies moving to the cloud. Are we seeing like the concerns about ransomware and cybersecurity is perhaps a tailwind that you guys are dealing now with just for public safety, but across the board? And are you seeing the life cycle of the systems that you're replacing, is that shrinking? So are we seeing an acceleration in the refresh cycle, albeit it might be small, but are we seeing some level of that, you think? 
H. Moore: I don't know about that. I guess I would just say that -- so my comment before on cybersecurity is look, we all know what's out there. It's a big event when it happens to a client.  Generally, they -- as I said, they view us and we view them as their trusted partner, and we're usually there to help them. And one of the things that they realize quickly is getting them into the cloud will make them much more secure.  It's -- to say that there's driving flips, it is. It's not a huge tailwind, but it's out there. And it's not necessarily something that we're hoping for. But it's just a fact of life. It's a fact of doing business in today's world. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. 
S. Kirk Materne: Brian, on the 21% growth in ARR and the flip, is that just largely pricing? Does that include cross-sell, upsell? I guess what does that entail? Is that -- I'm just trying to get a sense of it, that's sort of apples-to-apples or if you're seeing some of the sales synergies Lynn discussed earlier, factoring into that growth as well. 
Brian Miller: Yes. I think the biggest factor is larger average deal size. So we're seeing at least in the mix this quarter, and it won't necessarily be consistent every quarter because that can be kind of lumpy what that mix is. But we saw more bigger customers move we highlighted one of them, Fulton County, Georgia, with their tax solution. I think $1.3 million in ARR from that one. So seeing generally more larger customers in the mix. Last quarter, we had our first court flip. This quarter, we had the pellet court in Kansas flipping. 
 So it's more around the average size of the clients. But there also is upsell in those as well. So I think the average we've talked about still tends to be about 1.7, 1.8x uplift relative to the maintenance, but in some of these -- especially some of the larger ones, we've seen a bigger uplift where we've added new services or additional products when they flip. So a combination of both of those things. 
H. Moore: Yes. And Kirk, I think there's also been a few occasions where we may have won business a while ago. And to get that business, we had some contract concessions, maybe had some fixed pricing for a period of time. And the SaaS flip is an opportunity to sort of revisit that. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges from Goldman Sachs. 
Gabriela Borges: And Brian, I want to reconcile some of the commentary you're making on transaction -- on the transaction business. You commented specifically around higher transaction volumes and better pricing. So maybe just help us understand, is the volume is a function of the traction you're making in cross-sell and the run rate that you talked about earlier? Or is there an underlying dynamic going on as well? And then if you could touch on the pricing as well. Is there an additional dynamic around better pricing, independent of some of the specific contracts you talked about changing from gross to net and vice versa? 
Brian Miller: Yes. On the pricing side, specifically, we've talked about that as we continue to drive more business into the Tyler software customer base, we're able to generally achieve premium pricing or better pricing than a sort of a commodities type payment arrangement where we provide additional value from things like automated reconciliations. So having the software or the payments platform embedded with the software creates additional value for the customer and lets us get better pricing than some of the just payments-only type contracts. 
 So as we continue to add those, we're seeing improvements there. We've seen as well some price increases in some of our revenue-sharing arrangements with third-party payment processors that have also benefited us. And then we also saw, even though they're down year-over-year, we saw better-than-expected revenues from some of the other transaction volumes like driver history records, which tend to be a higher margin business as well. So sort of a combination of things driving that pricing. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schappel from Loop Capital Markets. 
Mark Schappel: John, I believe the remaining ARPA funds must be allocated by year-end. I was wondering if you could just comment on the impact ARPA funds are having on your business today. And whether you anticipate any demand falling off next year as these funds come to an end? 
John Marr: Yes. The ARPU funds generally have to be committed by the end of 2024 and spent by the end of 2026. And so the commitments -- I mean, largely, I think, at this point across the universe of our customers and prospects, I think the majority of those have been committed probably a strong majority, I think, 80%, 85%, maybe more than that. But committed and sort of an internal commitment and doesn't necessarily mean that they've even started a buying process. So they may have committed funds for a new ERP system, but they haven't even issued the RFP yet. 
 We've said that we believe it is a factor in the strong market conditions we've talked about, but not the biggest factor. And so we expect it to continue to be a tailwind of some sort, really through 2026 as those commitments turn into purchases and then turn into deliveries and revenue recognition for us. But we don't expect a big drop-off after that. Most -- we think some of them -- some of the funds used for things like hardware purchases around our school transportation solution that are sort of onetime purchases. But generally, when they're buying something from us, it creates a recurring revenue stream that they may fund the first 2 or 3 years out of ARPA funds, and then they have an ongoing expense with us for a subscription. So I think it's a tailwind, not the biggest factor in the market, we're seeing the one that we'll continue for a while. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Terry Tillman from Truist Securities. 
Terrell Tillman: Most of my questions have been asked -- answered. But one question I still had was, maybe we could talk about traction with AI-powered acquisitions. I think it was called out and it's on your slide deck. Just kind of curious, I know these were probably small acquisitions, but I'm curious about the revenue size of these products. And maybe kind of stack rank in terms of -- in your possession and with your size and scale and go-to-market, how would these opportunities stack up versus maybe what you did in the parks and recreation area or the vend engine and stuff in jails in the recent past? Just trying to better understand how meaningful these could be. 
H. Moore: Yes. Thanks, Terry. So I guess, first of all, like I said, we're early with these acquisitions. These acquisitions really fit the mold of acquisitions that we've done that have been very successful, which is a product differentiator that we can take into our installed base where we've got a really commanding position to leverage. I think each one of these 3 are -- have different growth trajectories, which is another one of our criteria is can this grow at a rate faster than Tyler's overall rate? And I think all 3 of these clearly ticked that box. I think the acquisition of CSI probably has a little bit bigger near-term market opportunity. The RexourceX will drive sufficient -- a lot of revenue in its own right, but it's also going to drive higher win rates for our ERP solutions, which is not necessarily as measurable.
 AR Inspect our field operations, new product. Again, we talked about there's a lot of interest there, a lot of excitement. And I'd expect that to really sort of all of them to outperform our expectations coming in. But based on those -- the criteria that I sort of originally outlined. So we're excited about all three of these. We're generally excited about every acquisition we do. But we -- these are off and running and off to a good start, and we're already seeing movements in the market based on these three acquisitions, and that's what's really appealing to me. 
Brian Miller: And collectively, those 3 are around $4 million of revenues for the quarter. So yes, small compared to Tyler's total. But interestingly, a couple of those deals we called out were significantly sized deals with large customers. So the Dallas County CSI, almost $1 million of ARR from the CSI product. So you see how that -- relative to a business group that are collectively doing around $4 million a quarter in revenues, adding single contracts that add $1 million of ARR is off to a nice start. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin from Wolfe Research. 
Aleksandr Zukin: So correct me if I'm wrong, but this is, I think, the first time since almost like 2014 that you've actually raised the top line guide for the full year after Q1. So maybe Lynn, just talk about and walk through what's giving you that confidence to do that? You guys don't usually do that. Is it improving demand from new arrangements as it flips? Is it transaction revenue expectations? It might be all of the above. It might be the M&A. But like what is driving that incremental confidence and conviction to kind of do something you don't usually do? 
H. Moore: Yes, it's a good point, Alex. And I was actually thinking to myself, when was the last time we'd ever done it, because I couldn't recall and you did my homework and told me it was 10 years ago. We just come off our management quarterly meetings. We've got really good visibility on what we see out there. And I would say it's improved. I talked earlier about not just the demand in the market, but what we're seeing for our sales outlook. We're just seeing a lot of things lining up in a way that gives us that confidence to do it, as you point out, I mean, it's not something we typically do. We were -- I wouldn't say we were conservative, but we like to not get ahead of our skis. And we'd like to tell you what we're going to do then we're going to go do it. And it's just -- it's a combination of a lot of factors. 
 I can tell you that for the last couple of years, one of the mantras I've been saying within Tyler to not just the management team, but to all the employees, whether it's in a town hall or what is, I would say, the last couple of years, I have never been more excited about Tyler's future than I am today. And coming into this year and really the last couple of months, I've switched that a little bit. So I've never been more confident in Tyler's future then I am today. And again, it's just a lot of things going right. We're clicking on all cylinders right now, and we've got an aligned management team with a singular vision, singular focus. There's a lot of initiatives going on at Tyler. I mean we're not just sitting back. There's a lot of things going on, but I just like where we sit right now. 
Brian Miller: And just generally, the revenue outperformance in Q1, obviously, it was not sort of pull forward or timing of things that we might have seen in the later quarter, especially around the transaction-based revenue, truly was additive to what we expected for the rest of the year. And so that drove us raising the outlook for the full year. 
Aleksandr Zukin: And I usually never asked this follow-up question, particularly because we love margins, and we love efficiency. But I guess, given this, call it, once in a decade incrementally higher level of confidence and conviction this early in a year. Is there a world where you do maybe push the throttle a little bit more on investments, both organic and/or inorganic as it does seem like the market seems to be coming to you at a faster pace? 
H. Moore: It's a good question, Alex. I think we -- I mean I don't know that we'll deviate from our historical practice of just taking a disciplined approach. We've got plans in place as it relates to margin and investment. I like our balance right now, I like our capital allocation where we sit right now. So I don't think you're going to hear us say this isn't 2017, 2018, where we're going to say, hey, this is now the time for elevated investment. We've got plenty of investments going on. And like I said, a lot of initiatives and both around revenue growth and margin expansion. So I don't think you'll hear that out of us over the next several quarters. 
Operator: This does conclude our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Lynn Moore for closing remarks. 
H. Moore: Thanks, Krista, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Brian Miller or myself. Thanks again, and have a great day. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-15 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Hello, and welcome to today's Tyler Technologies Fourth Quarter 2023 Conference Call. Your host for today's call is Lynn Moore, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, also, this conference is being recorded today, February 15, 2024.  I would like to turn the call over to Hala Elsherbini, Tyler's Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Hala Elsherbini: Thank you, Bhavesh, and welcome to our call. With me today is Lynn Moore, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. After I give the safe harbor statement, Lynn will have some initial comments on our quarter and then Brian will review the details of our results and provide our annual guidance for 2024. Lynn will end with some additional comments and then we'll take questions.  During this call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information, and may include projections concerning the company's future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projections. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Also in our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our Web site under the Financials tab schedules with supplemental information, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. On the Events and Presentations tab, we posted an earnings summary slide deck to supplement our prepared remarks. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Lynn?
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Hala. Fourth quarter results reflected a strong finish to a pivotal year in our cloud transition and return to year-over-year operating margin expansion. We achieved our key objectives for the year, and earnings and cash flow surpassed our expectations with free cash flow representing a new high for a fourth quarter. Recurring revenues grew 8% and comprised 84% of our total revenues. Our SaaS mix continued to accelerate and comprised 89% of Q4 new software contract value. The quarter was also highlighted by SaaS revenue growth of 21.7% and represented our 12th consecutive quarter of SaaS revenue growth of 20% or more, exceeding our near term growth expectations of a 20% CAGR in SaaS revenues through 2025. Transaction based revenues were impacted by seasonal trends and contractual changes in one of our state enterprise agreements that included a change from a gross to a net revenue model for payments. I want to remind you of the significance of pass through merchant fees in our payments business and how they impact both revenue growth and margins. The majority of our payment processing arrangements are accounted for under a gross model where we charge a fixed percentage of the transaction and are responsible for the merchant and interchange fees. Under this model, merchant fees are reflected in both revenues and expenses with the resulting drag on margins. In a smaller number of arrangements, the client is responsible for paying merchant fees directly and we record revenues on a net basis. We do not control which model the client chooses, although, we expect that the majority of payment processing contracts will continue to be under the gross model. Throughout the year and during the fourth quarter, we continued to make solid progress with key initiatives around our cloud transition. We started to realize the benefits of our cloud optimization efforts as we released cloud efficient versions of many of our products and began to experience hosting cost improvements as we scaled our deployments at AWS. These efficiencies related to our cloud operations contributed significantly to our year-over-year operating margin expansion in the fourth quarter. Cloud adoption with both new and existing on premises clients continued at an accelerated pace across our product portfolio. In the fourth quarter, the number of on premises migrations or flips signed was a new fourth quarter high at 92. The increased SaaS adoption in 2023 was particularly notable in the public safety market where we have seen a significant increase in SaaS adoption with new clients as well as signing our first flips. We also signed an expanded multiyear strategic collaboration agreement with Amazon Web Services to further enable the growing demand for our clients and public sector agencies to move to the cloud. Under the expanded agreement, we will jointly expand our framework and share programs to streamline migrations from on premises solutions to our next generation cloud applications. This is another major step forward in making the cloud accessible for our clients, further improving business continuity, continuous delivery and enhanced security. It also supports our Tyler 2030 vision to complete our transition to the cloud. The public sector market remains very healthy as evidenced by our elevated levels of RFPs and sales demo activity. Our pipeline reflects the benefits of a heightened level of sales collaboration across our division, driving strong upsell, cross sell and multi-suite deal momentum. Additionally, we continue to build sales synergies across Tyler with our integrated payments team as we execute our unified payment strategy. I'd like to highlight some of our significant fourth quarter wins. Our new transaction based contracts included a landmark win with the California Department of Parks and Recreation for our integrated outdoor recreation platform. This transaction based eight year contract is the largest transaction based arrangement in Tyler's history. This self funded contract, which is provided at no cost to California taxpayers, is valued at an estimated $175 million and includes two one year renewal options. It extends our existing relationship under our 2016 agreement, formerly as US eDirect, with enhanced functionality to add Tyler's end to end payment solution, enabling everything from reservations booking to payment processing. We are honored to be chosen to have such a key role in managing the nation's largest state park system. We also added to our growing footprint in outdoor recreation with a multiyear transaction based contract with the Wyoming State Parks and a SaaS arrangement with the City of Miami, Florida. We continue to execute on cross sell opportunities through our digital solutions, formerly NIC, state enterprise agreements that enable enhanced resident engagement across multiple public sector services. We signed two contracts under our state enterprise agreement in Mississippi as part of our newly launched resident engagement platform using Tyler's MyCivic platform. Working with the Mississippi Attorney General, we launched the Mississippi Access to Maternal Assistance mobile app, which includes the program's Web site and MyCivic platform to bridge access to public and private services across the state. We also signed an agreement with the Mississippi Department of Mental Health to develop a mobile application on our MyCivic platform that will allow the agency to provide useful mental health information to Mississippians affected by mental illness. We continue to build momentum in the public safety market with strong fourth quarter contract activity. Significant contracts included several competitive wins against a key competitors, making 2023 our most successful new business year in public safety since we acquired New World Systems in 2015. We also experienced a significant increase in SaaS adoption of our public safety solutions with SaaS comprising 46% of our fourth quarter public safety deals. Existing on premises public safety clients are also showing heightened interest in moving to the cloud, and three public safety clients signed contracts in the fourth quarter to flip to the cloud. The City of Klamath Falls, Oregon embraced the cloud first strategy signing a contract for a SaaS deployment for integrated enterprise public safety suite, which includes the full suite of our public safety solutions, including Enterprise Records Management, Jail Manager, Fire, electronic patient care reporting, civil process, e-citations and analytics. Our recent contract signed in Q2 with the Oregon State Patrol serve as a strong reference for this competitive win. Other notable public safety deals included a SaaS contract with Santa Rosa County, Florida and on-premises contracts with Rensselaer County and Wayne County both in New York. We also had a significant cross sell win under our state enterprise agreement in Arkansas for a public safety solution for Pulaski County, Arkansas. In the court space, we signed our first SaaS flip of a statewide court system with the Idaho Supreme Court. This five year agreement includes migrating the court's 44 counties and 200 courtrooms from on premises deployments to our SaaS offering. Our largest new SaaS deal in the quarter was with the state of North Carolina where we extended the term of our existing court SaaS agreement for five years and expanded the agreement to add our solution for appellate courts. We also achieved key operational milestones in Courts & Justice during the quarter, including the successful go live of our Enterprise Justice solution with the LA County Criminal Courts. This completed the countywide rollout across 35 court locations in the nation's largest court. With our application platform, we secured a key SaaS win with the Virginia Department of Education to upgrade its enterprise state regulatory system and modernize its citizen portal. The system will support the management of Virginia's child daycare programs, which are transitioning from the Department of Social Services to the DOE. During the fourth quarter, we also signed 172 new payments deals, bringing the total to 600 for the year. We also signed a new state enterprise contract in Maryland following a competitive rebid of our expiring contract as well as an extension of our Oklahoma enterprise agreement. Finally, as noted on our last call, we completed the acquisitions of ARInspect and ResourceX in October for a combined purchase price of approximately $37 million in cash and stock. We're pleased to see multiple early wins for application platform leveraging field operations and inspection capabilities that came to us through ARInspect. Now, I'd like Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our annual guidance for 2024.
Brian Miller: Thanks Lynn. Total revenues for the quarter were $480.9 million, up 6.3%. Organic revenue growth, which also excludes COVID related revenues in 2022, was 6.1%. The fourth quarter of 2022 included $3.5 million of revenues from COVID related initiatives at our Digital Solutions division, all of which ended in 2022. Subscription revenues increased 11.4% and organically rose 10.8%. Within subscriptions, our SaaS revenues grew 21.7% to $141 million and grew organically 21.2%, which is consistent with our near term growth expectations of 20% CAGR and SaaS revenues through 2025. Keep in mind that there is often a lag from the signing of a new SaaS deal or a flip to the start of revenue recognition that can vary from one to several quarters. Because of this as well as the timing of SaaS renewals and related price increases, SaaS revenue growth, both year-over-year and sequentially, may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Transaction revenues grew 3% to $145.1 million and were up 2.1% on an organic basis. The lower growth rate in transaction revenues reflects in part the change from gross to net revenue recognition for payments under one of our state enterprise agreements. Just a reminder here about the seasonality of our transaction revenues. Our seasonality is really driven by two primary factors; State determined deadlines, such as corporate filing deadlines or hunting seasons; and the number of business days. Even with online transactions, we see a decline in volumes over the holidays. Q2 is typically our highest volume quarter with peak outdoor seasons along with tax season deadlines followed by Q1 due to the high volume of corporate filing services with Q1 deadlines. Q4 will always lag with the holiday seasons, which lead to fewer business days. While the smaller impact revenues from driver history records are also stronger in the first half of the year. The sequential decline in transaction revenues this quarter reflects that typical seasonality. SaaS deals comprised approximately 89% of our Q4 new software contract value compared to 86% last year. Professional services revenue declined 3.7% due to the absence of COVID related revenues and was flat organically. As Lynn noted earlier, public sector demand remains healthy and we're pleased with the strength of our new contract signings in Q4. During the quarter, we added 156 new SaaS arrangements and converted 92 existing on premises clients to SaaS with the total contract value of approximately $137 million, an increase of 39% over last year. In Q4 of last year, we added 140 new SaaS arrangements and hit 82 on premises conversions with a total contract value of approximately $99 million. Also note that while the contract with the California State Parks includes our SaaS solution for outdoor recreation, it is not included in the new SaaS contract value, because it is funded completely from transaction fees. Overall, our pace of on premises conversions to SaaS continued at a steady pace with 338 flips in 2023. More importantly, the total contract value associated with flips increased to $92 million compared to $76 million last year. As we've discussed, conversions are a significant growth driver over the next several years as we accelerate the pace of flips. Including transaction revenues, expansions with existing clients and professional services, total bookings increased 21.2% on an organic basis. Our total annualized recurring revenue was approximately $1.61 billion, up 7.9% and organically grew 7.1%. Operating margins were better than expected despite pressure from our ongoing cloud transition. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 22.3%, up 70 basis points from Q4 last year. As Lynn discussed earlier, merchant and interchange fees from our payments business under the gross revenue model have a meaningful impact on our overall margins as they are passed through to clients and are included in both revenues and cost of revenues. We paid merchant fees of approximately $35 million in Q4 and approximately $157 million for the full year of 2023. Both cash flows from operations and free cash flow reached new highs for our fourth quarter at $147.4 million and $134.4 million respectively. Cash flow in the quarter was impacted by approximately $15 million of incremental cash taxes due to Section 174. And for the full year, those incremental cash taxes were approximately $127 million. We continue to prioritize repayment of term debt as a use of our cash flow. And in Q4, we reduced our term debt by $90 million, bringing our total repayments for the year to $345 million. We ended Q4 with total outstanding debt of $650 million and cash and investments of approximately $183 million. Our net leverage at quarter end was approximately 0.97 times trailing 12 month pro forma EBITDA. Our 2024 guidance is as follows. We expect total revenues will be between $2.095 billion and $2.135 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 8%. We also expect that merchant fees will be down slightly and that implied growth, excluding merchant fees, would be approximately 90 basis points higher. We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be between $5.17 and $5.37 and may vary significantly due to the impact of discrete tax items on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $8.90 and $9.10. We expect our free cash flow margin will be between 17% and 19%, including the impact of incremental cash taxes related to Section 174 of approximately $50 million. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release and in the Q4 earnings deck posted on our Web site. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn.
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. We entered 2024 with tremendous optimism and confidence in the year ahead and beyond as we execute our mid to long term strategy supporting our Tyler 2030 vision. We expect to return to a trajectory of consistent operating margin expansion in 2024 as we increasingly realize the benefits of our cloud optimization initiatives and execute our planned exits from our two proprietary data centers in 2024 and 2025. We continue to leverage our competitive strengths and demonstrate the value of our deep domain expertise across the broadest, most integrated offerings that are uniquely focused on the public sector, while empowering our clients who serve the public through Tyler's next generation cloud applications. Finally, we are proud to be recognized by Government Technology Magazine as a GovTech 100 company for 2024. This marks our 8th consecutive year being recognized for our work in making a difference for government through technology.  Now, we'd like to open the line for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ken Wong of Oppenheimer and Co.
Ken Wong: I wanted to maybe just touch on the accelerating pace of flips going into '24. On one hand, like I think that's a fantastic initiative. You guys are also dialing back or at least decelerating the pace of sales and marketing growth or SG&A, I guess, I'm modeling maybe mid single digits. I guess, what's the confidence in being able to accelerate that pace while also maybe not leaning in as aggressively on the sales and marketing side?
Brian Miller: Well, really, a lot of the movement in flip is -- doesn't require a lot of sales and marketing efforts. A lot of that is done through our inside sales organization through our existing client relationship managers, and it doesn't require a great deal of increase in sales and marketing expenses. And generally, we feel like that sort of mid single digit growth in sales and marketing like a lot of [Technical Difficulty] more cross selling [Technical Difficulty] more synergies across our sales organization, put more products in the same sales rep bags. So those two factors don't really conflict with each other. But we believe the resources we have in place really are sufficient to drive the pace of flips we expect to see over the next several years.
Lynn Moore: Just a follow-up on that. I mean when we outlined our Tyler 2030 vision, we obviously -- we've got some goals around flips over the next six, seven years. And we also have goals on on some of our G&A initiatives. So I think those are both tracking right now in line and with our expectations going forward.
Ken Wong : And then just a quick follow-up in terms of the hosting efficiencies. I guess would you say we've peaked in terms of kind of extracting the efficiencies there or is there still a little room to go?
Lynn Moore: I think there's still room to go and there's a lot that goes into that. We're continuing to optimize our products and find ways for them to run more efficiently. On the other side of it, we're also seeing -- continuing to make strides in our version consolidation, particularly with our major product lines. We've seen, over the last 12 months, significant version consolidation in two of our larger flagship products, and that will continue to contribute efficiencies as we go forward, as well as with some of our other products that are out there.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia of Barclays.
Saket Kalia: Lynn, maybe for you, just along those lines. I was wondering if you could just go one level deeper into the latest agreement with AWS. And maybe the question is, how does the new agreement maybe change what you had previously and how can that sort of continue to support the profitability growth that we're clearly seeing?
Lynn Moore: As you know, we signed an extension that now runs through the end of 31, which runs through our Tyler 2030 initiative, which is great. It obviously just further deepen those relationships. We've made certain commitments to AWS around migrating our existing Tyler clients, our net new clients into AWS. AWS has also made commitments back to us around certain pricing commitments, innovation, marketing, things like that. I'm not really at liberty to go into the specifics of what those details and those commitments and pricing concessions are. But what I can say is that AWS has been a great partner for us. I couldn't be more happy with the relationship that we started in the fall of 2019. And this extension, I think, further embraces that. They're very collaborative with us and are eager to work with us to help us find ways to lower our costs. So they are a true partner. Similarly, we view our clients in the public sector as partners, that's why they view us. And I think part of the difference also in our relationship now is it's more mature. And we're a lot farther along in our cloud journey than we were when we first signed it. If you remember when we first signed the agreement, we were still trying to figure out how our products would really operate in AWS, and we spent a long time trying to just figure out the cost of just moving simply lift and shift. And now we've transformed and we've done all that and it's how can we make them run even more efficiently in the public cloud. So great partner, excited that they're on this journey with us for the next at least eight years.
Saket Kalia: That sounds like a win-win for everybody. I'll stick to the one follow-up and Brian, maybe it's for you. Great to see Tyler reach the 17% to 19% free cash flow target. I think one year ahead of schedule, and you correct me there if I'm wrong. I know we're not speaking to 2025 necessarily on this call, but maybe conceptually, how do you sort of think about free cash flow margin expansion versus EBIT margin expansion? Should those two things move largely in the same range or is there any reason to think that one should expand faster than the other? Does that make sense?
Brian Miller: Yes. I think in the near term, they likely expand in the same range. And particularly, I think you see that in 2024, most likely, especially because we still, although, it's lessening and lessens over the next several years, there still is an impact of the Section 174 change. It was $127 million impact on our free cash flow in 2023. It's about a $50 million impact in 2024 and it will decline again over the next four years after that until it sort of reaches equilibrium. But I think in the longer term, we would expect that free cash flow growth would be higher, especially if you take out that Section 174 impact, because of a couple of things. We've continued to get leverage out of CapEx and especially as we exit our data centers where a significant amount of our CapEx has been focused in recent years as we continue to become more efficient around how we manage office facilities and our other CapEx associated with our business. And actually, you'll see we have lower expectation for CapEx around software development going forward as well. But most importantly, the cash flow characteristics of the recurring revenues, the SaaS revenues paid in advance and create deferred revenue, the transaction revenue is generally getting paid at the time of the transaction. So there aren't big receivables associated with those. So as those businesses grow, those revenue streams grow, they should have the impact of causing our cash flow to grow faster than the EBIT.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Reilly from Needham.
Joshua Reilly: Overall, the demand environment seems very strong, but the initial revenue guidance for 2024 was a bit below the Street at the midpoint, and implies a little greater acceleration in 2025 to hit the midterm target for revenue of $2.35 billion. How are you thinking about the progression to hit this 2025 target now, given the initial revenue guidance for the year?
Lynn Moore: Josh, right now, I would say I'm confident in both our 2025 and our 2030 projections just from overall what I'm seeing in the business. As Brian remarked or pointed out in the opening remarks, a couple of things impact revenue growth this year, and one really is the flat to slightly declining merchant fee growth. So when you pull out merchant fees, our growth is really more in the closer to mid-9s, probably 93%, 94%, it's about 90 basis points and those tend to fluctuate. And part of that is, as Brian mentioned, due to one of our large state enterprise contracts flipping from the gross to net model. Overall, as you pointed out, I mean, what we're seeing in the markets right now, the demand, the number of new business deals we're signing, our competitive position, wins against really some key large Tier 1 competitors are the things that really give me a lot of confidence. We recently had our national sales meeting really dive deep into sales forecast, not only for the next 12, 24 months, but even beyond. And right now, things look pretty good.
Joshua Reilly: And then just a quick follow-up. The Idaho Courts deal, that seems like an important deal in terms of being the first. I believe it's the first state to migrate out of the 16 or 17 that you have on-premise case management installations. Do you think this is a tipping point or do you think that the others 16 or 17 states are still a couple of years away from migrating?
Lynn Moore: Yes, I think it's hard to say, Joshua. All of our global submarket’s a little bit different and the courts market, for sure, it's an area where people may be a little reluctant to go first. So getting Idaho there and going, eyes are going to be on it. And I think as we successfully pull off that deal, I do think it will trigger more throughout the courts community. As you know, everything we do is reference business. But particularly in these larger state wide deals our state corp business, I think all the other states are watching Idaho. So we need to do what we do best, which is go and execute on the business and go make it a great experience. And I do think that will be a domino that will ripple throughout the client base.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Terrell Tillman of Truist Securities.
Connor Passarella: This is Connor Passarella on for Terry. I also just wanted to ask one on the Idaho state court deal. First, could you maybe just break down how we should think about this deal playing out in the model, and maybe what the time line looks like for getting a large court system like this live in terms of the courtrooms and the counties and kind of how it all works with getting to cloud?
Brian Miller: Yes, it's going to take some time for the full impact of this deal. And I think we're going to recognize probably about 50% of the uplift revenue in 2024 and we'll really see the full impact in 2025. All of our courts’ businesses are large projects. We talked about the L.A. criminal courts go live, probably one of the most successful go-lives we've had in Tyler's history. This will mirror that as it will be our first statewide flip. But from a timing perspective, revenues, uplift, all that, we'll get about 50% of it in 2024, and in 2025, we'll have the full run rate.
Lynn Moore: I think about midyear is -- because that midyear is when we expect to start to bring them up into AWS. And that uplift is included in our guidance for the year, but it's a couple of million dollar uplift from what they were paying in maintenance.
Connor Passarella: And then just on a follow-up. I just wanted to ask one around transaction revenues. Could you maybe just talk a little more about the impact of payments from customers flipping gross to net in the quarter? I think you mentioned the flip in one of the state enterprise agreements. I was just curious on how that impacted overall revenue in that segment?
Brian Miller: As we've talked about, one of our state contracts actually midyear changed from gross to net. So we had that impact in the second half of this year and it also impacts us in the first half of next year. I think the overall impact for the second half of the year was in the $9 million to $10 million range. The first half of next year, because is, I believe, somewhere in a similar range. And that was probably split between Q3 and Q4 but probably a little bit more of that impact was in Q3, but there was a several million dollar impact on the quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt VanVliet of BTIG.
Matt VanVliet: I guess on the deal with the California Parks division there, you talked about it being exclusively funded through transaction revenue. Maybe just help us think about kind of I guess, not only maybe what the contractual minimums might be there, what's sort of embedded in guidance? How much potential upside is there to what's embedded in guidance? And then maybe more importantly down the road, do you envision other states trying to take on approach more like this, where there's less contracted SaaS revenue and more funded through the program itself?
Lynn Moore: Matt, I'll start and Brian, you may jump in. There are a couple of things that are really exciting about that California State Parks deal. One obviously is it's the largest transaction deal in Tyler's history. The second thing is, as you pointed out, it validates this sort of self funding model. It's not a surprise. Anybody who reads the journal that California has significant deficits and significant budgetary issues right now. And so going to them with a self funded model on this type of contract is really about the only way they can do it. And so again, it validates that model, that part of our business. Because it's self funded, the impact going forward we will be recognizing a lot more expense in 2024. It's actually a little bit of a drag on margins in 2024. But ramps up significantly in '25 and continues that ramp up with margin expansion all the way through the end of the contract in 2031, assuming we don't get the two one year extensions, which if we execute, we think we would get. Brian, do you have anything more to add?
Brian Miller: Just to say, your point is good, because it isn't a fixed SaaS fee that the transaction revenues are currently an estimate. And we think we have a pretty good idea of what volumes will be, but they may vary from that. And it will -- currently in the plan for this year, we expect a few million dollars of revenues and then it ramps up to that north of $20 million starting and it will be approaching, we think, $20 million next year and then be north of $20 million beyond that as volumes increase and it becomes fully ramped. But yes, it is subject to variances and subject to seasonality as well unlike a regular SaaS contract that is a pro rata revenue recognition every quarter. This will also have seasonality and it's around those as we do in many of our outdoor transaction revenues.
Matt VanVliet: And then maybe just one clarification around the AWS extension. As you continue to scale that business, are we still at maybe a subscale type of cost relative to the revenue running through that system? Meaning is there still more leverage that can be achieved over the next couple of years through that contract or are we at a level now where it's kind of a pay as you go as you get more scale?
Lynn Moore: No, I think there's still more leverage. And I think generally going forward, we make certain commitments to AWS, and we're making those commitments based on projections. But we're continuing, as I mentioned earlier, to further optimize our products, further reduce our versions. I think the leverage in our cloud operations still has quite a bit of room to go.
Brian Miller: And I'd point out one other thing about the California contract. As we mentioned on the call, this is a significant expansion of what is already in an existing agreement we have with California under with US eDirect, which we acquired after we acquired NIC. So there are currently annual revenues under that agreement of a little less than $3 million a year. So it's not all incremental revenues but it's a significant increase in the revenues as that has expanded and especially because it now includes payment processing.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges of Goldman Sachs.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Kelly [indiscernible] on for Gabriela. Another question on the number of conversions. Conversions have been in kind of the 70 to 100 range per quarter for the past two years. How should we think about the ramp to converting maybe hundreds of customers a quarter, and are you sharing any expectations for a number of flips in 2024?
Lynn Moore: You're right. Kelly, our flips in Q4 were actually up about 12% over Q4 last year. We're not putting out guidance as far as I know, Brian, on specific foot deal count. There's a lot of things that go into that. And as you look out to 2030, the goals we outlined, clearly, we will be ramping up as over time. There's things that go into the flips and a lot of it is, we have to get our customers on more modern versions. And when I talk about our version collapse efforts that have been going on for several years but some of the strides that we've been making, as we continue to make strides on that, it will make -- it will help accelerate the pace of flips going forward.
Brian Miller: I just would add that it's also important, I think, to look at the size of the flips and the dollar value. So for example, this quarter with the signing the Idaho State Port deal significantly bigger than most of our typical flips. So even though that only counts as one of the 92, the dollars were pretty meaningfully different. And I think in our prepared remarks, we talked about the the size of the increase in the dollar value of the flip contracts. And so in general, I'd expect that as we go forward over the next few years that we'll see more of our larger clients start to move, and so it has a bigger impact on that uplift on the dollar side. So obviously, each flip is not created equal and in general, we've got more of our large clients that are still to be migrated.
Unidentified Analyst: A quick follow-up. On that version control point, you mentioned last quarter, you had the goal kind of by the end of 2022 or early 2024 of only supporting two of the most recent versions of each product. Where are you at in kind of achieving that goal?
Lynn Moore: We've made a lot of progress, in particular, if you look at our enterprise ERP product, for example, I think at the end of last year, we only had about 23% of that client base on the more modern version at the end of this year, end of 202,3 that was up to 86%. We've made similar strides with our Enterprise Justice solution. So just generally, across the board, we're tracking on that. I'm not sure if I remember saying at the end of 2025, I think it was more 26%. But I think we're actually ahead of the pace that I was thinking about and discussing maybe 18 months, 24 months ago.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Oliver from Baird.
Rob Oliver: Lynn, first question is for you. Just around public safety, it must be gratifying just to see the way the business is working after many years through the New World acquisition and now moving to cloud faster than expected. So my question is, it seems like that would be good for Tyler. I just would be curious to hear your view on any potential shift in the competitive landscape that, that might cause, meaning some of your legacy typical competitors that we know in this space, are they properly cloud enabled and conversely, are you seeing new competitors in the market in public safety as these deals shift more to cloud first? And then I had a quick follow-up for Brian.
Lynn Moore: Rob, it's actually -- it's very interesting and to your point, gratifying to see this shift. And we've been anticipating it, but we just didn't know when it was going to happen. I think we mentioned in the opening remarks, about 46% of our Q4 deals were cloud deals in public safety, that's up from 16% in Q2. And as we look out next year, we think it's going to cross 50% and we're sort of planning on a little north of 50%. We're taking an approach that now with public safety as we see the market receptiveness start to be, it's an approach that we took generally with Tyler going back four, five years, which is, going forward, we really want to be leading to the cloud. We think the market is ready. As it relates to competitors, I'm not going to list all the different competitors in public safety. Obviously, we've had a few pop up in the last couple of years that were more cloud native already. Those have been a little bit smaller competitors and they have had their own set of issues to deal with. I think that we are well positioned with our cloud strategy in public safety to take advantage of this market shift. We have new leadership at public safety. If you've been on our Web site, you might have seen a new division president that came on last year, came from outside of Tyler. He's actually has led -- been a part of leading companies through the cloud transition. So it's exciting to have him there, have him up in Troy with the people and really sort of helping lead those efforts. So I like where we are, like where we sit. And to reiterate your words, it's gratifying to see these early results. But a lot of things I'm going to caution is a lot of things to go execute on in the future, but it is good to see this shift starting to happen in public safety.
Rob Oliver: And then Brian, just a question around the R&D expense guide for the year, implying kind of mid-teens year-over-year growth. Can you just talk about what some of the biggest drivers of that are within that R&D line?
Brian Miller: I mean, I think it continues to be a lot of development around the cloud and our optimization and efficiency efforts around optimizing our products for the cloud. There is a shift from some R&D that was previously being capitalized, especially around some of the cloud projects that will now be expensed. So a lot of it is the same people but now running through expense as opposed to being capitalized. And that's -- obviously, it doesn't change our cash flow but it changes where it turns up on the income statement. So I think it's important to note that we are expecting to drive margin expansion even as we have a movement away from capitalized software development and to more R&D expense.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Charles Strauzer of CJS Securities, Inc.
Charles Strauzer: Looking at the guidance, especially as it pertains to the quarters. Are there any abnormalities that we should take into account as we build our models out?
Brian Miller: I don't think there's anything unusual. What we did point out, I think we and the Street are still getting used to the seasonality of the transaction business. And I see when they were a separate public company, certainly we're well versed in that and people who followed them more. But as that impacts Tyler and as we saw this quarter that seasonality around the transactions is pretty significant. I don't expect that to be meaningfully different in 2024, but I think that's the biggest thing to look out for when you look at the quarters.
Charles Strauzer: And then just more of a macro question for you, given the impact in Congress related to the spending bill. Are you seeing any changes to the sales cycle, especially in your federal business?
Lynn Moore: Charles, not really, not right now. Q1 is probably -- we talked about the situation -- was talking about seasonality. Q1 is probably a little bit slower time in that business as well. And right now, there's no real change in our outlook.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho of William Blair.
Jonathan Ho: Just one question to start out with in terms of operating leverage. Can you maybe walk through for us some of the levers that you have to pull down on for additional operating leverage and some of the moving parts there as we think about your guidance for 2024.
Brian Miller: I'd say most of the leverage that we're seeing in the model is coming from cloud operations and the things we've talked about, the impact of our -- moving customers out of our data centers and into ABS and our plan to have that first data center close midyear, the benefits we're getting from both scale and improved costs at AWS as we put our new customers there and move existing hosted customers into AWS. So those unit costs become lower. And I think the new agreement with AWS further helps that pricing and leverage that we get as we scale that business. The version consolidation expenses or benefits that Lynn mentioned as we eliminate multiple versions of software and create efficiencies around both support and development. So those cloud operations are really the biggest things driving our margin leverage and those are the things we pointed to at Investor Day that will continue to drive that margin expansion that we expect to see over the next several years as we [Technical Difficulty] 2030 targets.
Lynn Moore: And Jon, I would just add to -- I mean, we're always looking at levers to help make us more efficient. There's a number of internal initiatives going on where we look around and look up and see opportunities for where we can operate internally more efficiently. And there's a number of those things that we're actively acting on, which is, that really sounds weird, we're progressing on.
Jonathan Ho: Just with regards to use of capital, now that your debt payments have put sort of the interest payments under 1 times EBITDA, how should we think about your plans for capital deployment going forward?
Lynn Moore: I think right now, we're still sort of in the same place we've been for the last couple of years. We're even though we will likely pay off the term debt sometime this spring, we still have that $600 million convert that's due in a little more than two years. So my anticipation would be we will be building some cash reserves to be in a position to pay that off rather than renegotiate that at a high bank rate. But at the same time, just like we've done over the last couple of years, we were going to continue to do M&A, particularly where it makes sense strategically and where it's accretive to Tyler. Last year, we did four deals. I think we spent about $75 million, $76 million in cash and stock. Over the last few years, we've spent several hundred million dollars of deals even as we were prioritizing debt paydown. So we still want to prioritize being in a good position when the convertible is due, but at the same time, we'll make smart acquisitions along the way.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI.
Kirk Materne: Lynn, can you remind us just when, say, contracts that you signed on a SaaS basis, four or five years ago start to come up for renewal. How much of that is the renewal function, an opportunity for cross-sell, upsell for you? Meaning as Munis or ERP deals or SaaS deals come up, is that an opportunity for the salespeople to start talking about additional products or solutions? Meaning we should start to get into a little bit of a renewal cycle over the next couple of years. Just wondering how that works in terms of the uplift, either on a cross or upsell basis?
Lynn Moore: Well, it certainly is another conversation point with the client. So anytime you use a conversation point, there's opportunities for cross sell, upsell. But we've got installed sales teams across all of our organizations and they're reaching out to clients whether they're halfway through their SaaS contract or at the beginning of the SaaS contract or towards the end of it. So I don't know that that's a specific trigger for signify material uplift, but it's another data point that's a contact point with our clients.
Brian Miller: Flips provide that same opportunity. So we're having conversations with clients about moving a product to the cloud, it gives us an opportunity to have that conversation around other products, maybe in that same suite that they might have on premises from another provider that aren't Tyler products, and the opportunity to bring together an integrated set of solutions while they're moving to the cloud. And I think that as we continue to accelerate the pace of those that we'll continue to look for those opportunities for greater upsells and cross sells.
Kirk Materne: And then I guess, Brian, speaking of flips, obviously, you're guiding maintenance revenue to come down a little bit, which makes tons of sense as you flip people from on-prem to cloud. Can you just remind us the benefits of the uplift of that change? That plays out over a couple of years, meaning you just used the Idaho example. The reason you're not seeing sort of the SaaS revenue get all the benefit of that flip is you're just not going to see it on the income statement until '25. So is that the way we should think about sort of that 1.7% uplift that plays out over 24 months?
Brian Miller: Yes, there's always a lag. And sometimes we might sign a flip and it starts next quarter and then we see that uplift then. Other times, whether it's because of things that the client needs to do to get internally to get ready to move, whether it's that they need to upgrade to a current version of the software or they need to do things, they've got other internal priorities around their own resources that caused a delay or -- there are a variety of reasons why there can be a lag of from one to multiple quarters. And sometimes it doesn't all happen at once. So they may be flipping multiple applications with us so that they start -- the uplift starts at different times. So I'd say generally, it's not 24 months, but it could be from one to a few quarters before we see the full impact of those from the time we sign it to when we see the impact on the uplift.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research.
Alex Zukin: Maybe just the first one. I think last quarter, you talked about wanting to do about 100-plus flips in Q4. Is the right way to think about it that the dollar value of the flips was in line with your expectations, but maybe not the actual number? And then to the point earlier, did some of those get pushed into '24 and now there is the opportunity for a higher dollar value in '24? Just help us understand a little bit about that dynamic.
Brian Miller: Well, I'd just say when we talk about the number of flips, it's just not that precise. I mean the timing, for example, the Idaho -- signing the Idaho agreement, I think, it was almost three years in the making that we had discussions with them and planning. As Lynn was talking about, it's very complex to move a statewide court system, a lot of planning on their part, a lot of planning on our part and how that all goes and getting comfortable with that, so what quarter that actually gets signed in. Now not all of them are that complex but there's not that much precision around directionally whether it's 92 or 100 or 103. So I'd say that the number was generally in line and the pace at which they're moving is in line with our expectations. The dollar value probably was a bit ahead of, but we expected. So there was a little bit more larger ones in there and the uplifts were a little better than we expected. But it's really hard to be very precise from quarter-to-quarter about what we expect. But we are saying that we are on track with our long term expectation that the number of clients and the dollar volume that will migrate over the next several years as we drive towards that 75% to 85% of our customer base migrated to the cloud by 2030. But just like with new business signings, the exact quarter it falls in is a bit hard to predict, but we're at least in line with our expectations around flips.
Alex Zukin: And then maybe just as a follow-up. There's currently legislation out there that could reverse some of the R&D tax payments that you had to make. What would be the impact of -- if that act passed on you guys, like how much and when would you see those dollars return?
Brian Miller: Yes, it's a little hard to tell exactly. I think the bill that's out there now that I believe is passed the house would actually not resend it, it would delay it until 2026. So the incremental taxes that we would -- if that became effective, we would not have to pay in the incremental taxes, the $50 million that we've talked about for this year and lesser numbers going forward. It's a little unclear exactly how and when we would sort of get back the taxes we paid in and incremental taxes we paid in, in 2023, which were $127 million, presumably, those would either offset our normal tax payments to reduce those tax payments over the next year or two or we would file for a refund, which also takes some time. So it's hard to exactly quantify how that would be. But clearly, we wouldn't have those incremental payments going forward. And in some manner, we would look to recover the incremental taxes we paid in either through refunds or lower estimated payments going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Housum of Northcoast Research.
Keith Housum: In terms of the backlog, you obviously had a nice jump this quarter year-over-year. How are we thinking about the duration of that backlog? Is it holding relatively stable or is that getting longer?
Brian Miller: It's generally stable. The part that's expected to be recognized in the next 12 months, I think, is reasonably stable with where it's been. The term of new SaaS deals, for example, this quarter, I think, was very similar. It was a little under four years average term. So it's fairly consistent with what we've seen in recent quarters. And then, of course, the transaction contracts don't really go into backlog. So they don't really affect that number. But on the software side, I'd say it's -- there aren't any meaningful changes in that duration of backlog.
Keith Housum: Just as a follow-up. There's obviously been a lot of high-profile cybersecurity issues over the past year with public agencies. Have those issues been with agencies that have been primarily on-prem versus the cloud? And if it's been on-prem, are you seeing that as perhaps 1 of the impetuses for the acceleration of the flips?
Lynn Moore: Yes, absolutely. You're spot on on both. And some of these issues have come with obviously some existing clients of ours and it is an opportunity. The cloud is more stable, more secure. We actually have done some deals where clients who might have been resistant to the cloud have flipped, because of some sort of recent ransomware or other issue.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Alexei Gogolev of JP Morgan.
Alexei Gogolev: Lynn, I recall comments from last year that roughly 20% of your customers have migrated to the cloud. Can you provide an update of that mix as you move towards that target of 75% by 2030?
Lynn Moore: Yes, I think at Investor Day, we said we were somewhere around 15%. And so obviously, we've made progress since then. I'd say we're probably more around the 20% number now in terms of the -- that we've moved. But as I said earlier, we are -- each of our products has a time line and a road map for how they get to that point that converges on our entire customer base being 75% to 85% of the existing on-prem customers converted by 2030. So each product is starting from a different place with their customer base. We've talked about public safety just getting its first flips this past year. Other products are much further along. So everybody has their own road map that converge on that overall number by 2030. And none of those will happen exactly as planned but we have said that we are collectively on track to achieve those targets by 2030.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Clarke Jeffries of Piper Sandler.
Clarke Jeffries: Lynn, I wanted to go back to something you said about the California contract and the fact that there will be a drag on margins but margin expansion over multiple years. Wondering if you could help explain that. Does that mean that there will be partial volume that moves to you and then full volume over time? Is that just reflective of services implementation costs in the first year that go away and [Multiple Speakers].
Lynn Moore: Yes, let me clarify that. It's a drag on margin in 2024. It will probably equate roughly to maybe a little bit of margin drag in '25, but it's just the ramp-up of revenues versus expenses. So the expenses are more front loaded to get them up and running. As Brian mentioned, we're going from a contract that was a little under $3 million a year in revenues. I think first year, we're expecting it to just slightly more than double that. But you look out in 2025, it goes to $20 million and we expect it to grow all the way up to close to $30 million by the end of the contract. We do expect positive OP starting next year and ramping up significantly each year over time.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of David Unger of Wells Fargo.
David Unger: So back to the flips again, and the topic [Indiscernible] the call, if I would ask is, how should we think about license TCV as a percentage of total TCV on a normalized quarterly run rate path to both the midterm and long term target?
Brian Miller: We would expect license revenues to -- well, license revenues, which are mostly recognized upfront. So we actually expect low single digit growth this year. But in terms of the mix for them to continue to decline as part of our overall mix, I don't have that sort of broken out year-by-year or quarter-by-quarter. But we would expect that, that percentage of new business that's now in the high 80s to continue to expand incrementally year-by-year until there's very little license revenue left. We do have some third party licenses. We have some license sales back into existing on-prem customers. But really selling very little, only a couple of products where we really sell any licenses at all in the new business market.
Lynn Moore: And I think part of your question was around total contract value, TCV. So that will obviously vary a little bit depending on the SaaS term that we sign. You could use a rule of thumb of what a license deal and a one year maintenance that might drag on that versus sort of what we would project as a normal SaaS deal. So if the SaaS contract was probably only one or two years, it's probably going to have a lower TCV. If it's north of three years, we get to four years, five years, we'd have probably initial higher TCV.
Operator: We appear to be no further questions at this time. Mr. Lynn Moore, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. I'll turn the call back over to you.
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Lavesh, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Brian Miller or myself. Thanks. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-11-02 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to today's Tyler Technologies Third Quarter 2023 Conference Call. Your host for today's call is Lynn Moore, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. In order to address your questions and stay within the allotted time, please limit your questions to one question per person. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, also, this conference is being recorded today, November 2, 2023. I would like to turn the call over to Hala Elsherbini, Tyler's Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Hala Elsherbini: Thank you, Aaron, and welcome to our call. With me today is Lynn Moore, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. After I give the safe harbor statement, Lynn will have some initial comments on our quarter, and then Brian will review the details of our results and provide an update to our annual guidance. Lynn will end with some additional comments and then we'll take questions. During this call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information and may include projections concerning the company's future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projections. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Also, in our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financials tab schedules with supplemental information, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. Please note, there have been minor re-classes between historical SaaS and transaction-based revenues on the supplemental schedule as a result of the recent transition to our new financial systems. On the Events & Presentations tab, we have posted an earnings summary slide deck to supplement our prepared remarks. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Lynn?
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Hala. Our third quarter earnings and cash flow surpassed expectations and reflect a continuation of execution at a high level on key operational initiatives. We achieved strong performance across several of our key metrics with double-digit recurring growth and free cash flow growth of more than 40%. Our recurring revenue mix rose to 83.4% of our total revenues with SaaS revenues up 26% organically. This was our 11th consecutive quarter of SaaS revenue growth of 20% or more and exceeded our near-term growth expectations of a 20% CAGR in SaaS revenues through 2025, as outlined during our June Investor Day. We also achieved solid growth in our transaction-based revenues, which were up 8.5%. While operating margins this quarter declined slightly from last year as expected due to our cloud transition, margins were ahead of plan as a result of our operating efficiencies and expense management, especially around cloud operations. It is encouraging to see margins hold essentially flat with last year even as we made considerable progress in our cloud optimization and cloud transition efforts, establishing a clear road map for operating margin improvement in 2024. The third quarter presented a very difficult comparison for our new software contract value and mix as last year's third quarter included two very large SaaS contracts that totaled $70 million in contract value. As we discuss regularly, the timing of large deals such as the two signed in last year's third quarter can cause significant lumpiness in our new software bookings. We're continuing to see a healthy public sector market environment and our new business pipeline is active. Leading indicators RFPs and sales demos remain strong with deals generally moving through the pipeline at a normal pace, which is often a 12- to 18-month procurement process. Overall, our competitive position and win rates are strong with growing momentum in cross-selling activities, a key value creation lever. Additionally, our transaction business continues to capture higher volumes as we gain traction with our unified payments solution. I'd like to highlight some of our significant third quarter wins, which included a number of cross-sell opportunities. We continue to build momentum with our public safety solutions. Key third quarter wins include the Naperville, Illinois Police Department for integrated public safety suite including CAD, records management and e-citations. Naperville is the fourth largest city in Illinois, a state where we also have a strong presence with our Enterprise Justice solution. We're also pleased to see SaaS adoption growing and acceptance in the market with several cloud contracts signed during the quarter. We continue to gain traction with cross-sell wins under our digital solutions division, formerly NIC, and our state enterprise agreements. Under our state enterprise agreement in Utah, we won a cross-sell opportunity with the Utah Department of Corrections for our enterprise corrections electronic messaging solution. We also added deals for our application platform formerly entellitrak, under our state enterprise agreements in Louisiana and Indiana. In the federal market, we secured a significant license win with the US National Guard Bureau for our turnkey suite of workforce case management applications. This is our largest workforce case management application within the Department of Defense and is another marquee win that spans 54 US states, territories in the District of Columbia that will be hosted in our FedRAMP-certified private cloud. We signed a five-year multi-suite SaaS contract with Port Angeles, Washington, which includes our enterprise ERP, enterprise permitting licensing and cybersecurity solutions as well as payments. In the outdoor accretion space we won a competitive deal for accretion dynamic solutions with the Minnesota State Parks. In our Payments business, we signed a one-year extension for enterprise payment processing under our state enterprise agreement in New Jersey. In Harris County, Texas, the third largest county in the nation, added our digital jury solution, leveraging the disbursements capabilities that came to us through the Rapid Financial acquisition last year. Before I turn the call over to Brian, I want to highlight our recent acquisition activity. As I said at our Investor Day, M&A is part of our DNA. And during the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of Computer Systems Innovations for approximately $36 million in cash. CSI brings AI-driven automation and enhanced document processing technology that can be leveraged across many of Tyler's vertical applications. It has primarily served the court technology space for many years, and we're excited about the opportunity to combine expansive footprint with CSI's expertise in AI and machine learning applications to elevate several of our other solutions. Earlier this week, we completed two other tuck-in acquisitions. ARInspect is a leading provider of AI-powered machine learning and data-driven solutions for public sector field operations. ARInspect's advanced AI solution and expertise extends our applications platform with intelligent edge technology that can be leveraged across our state and federal verticals. ResourceX adds priority-based budgeting solutions to our entire ERP portfolio to address key challenges our clients face in their traditional budgeting process. The total purchase price for these two acquisitions was approximately $38 million in cash and stock. We're thrilled to welcome each of these companies and their team members to Tyler. Now I'd like Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our annual guidance for 2023.
Brian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. Total revenues for the quarter were $494.7 million, up 4.5%. Organic revenue growth, which also excludes COVID-related revenues, was 6.0%. Last year's third quarter included $11.7 million of revenues from COVID-related initiatives at our Digital Solutions division, all of which ended in 2022. Subscriptions revenue increased 16.1% and organically rose 14.7%. Within subscriptions, our SaaS revenues grew organically 26% and to $138.5 million. It is important to note that as our software contract mix continues to shift towards SaaS, our growth rate may vary from quarter-to-quarter due to the lag in time from contract signing to the start of revenue recognition, but we remain on track with our near-term growth expectations of a 20% CAGR in SaaS revenues through 2025. Transaction revenues grew 8.5% to $156.7 million, up 6% on an organic basis. License revenue declined 47.9% as our software business continues to shift to SaaS. SaaS deals comprised 80% of our Q3 new software contract value compared to 91% last year. As we noted earlier, last year's Q3 included two large SaaS deals totaling $70 million in contract value. Professional services revenue declined 14.9% primarily due to the absence of COVID-related revenues and was flat organically. We added 161 new SaaS arrangements and converted 79 existing on-premises clients to SaaS with a total contract value of approximately $71 million. In Q3 of last year, we added 153 new SaaS arrangements and had 70 on-premises conversions with a total contract value of approximately $149 million. Overall, our pace of on-premises conversions to SaaS continues at a steady pace with 246 slips year-to-date, and we expect Q4 conversions will be 100 or more. More importantly, the total contract value associated with flips has increased year-to-date to $58 million. As we've discussed, conversions are a significant growth driver over the next several years as we accelerate the pace of flips. Including transaction revenues, expansions with existing clients and professional services, total bookings increased 10.3% on an organic basis. Our total annualized recurring revenue was approximately $1.65 billion, up 11% and organically grew 9.8%. Operating margins were better than expected despite pressure from our ongoing cloud transition. Our non-GAAP OP margin was 24.8%, down by 10 basis points from Q3 of last year. As we discussed in prior quarters, merchant and interchange fees from our payments business under the gross revenue model have a meaningful impact on our overall margins. In Q3, we paid merchant fees of approximately $36 million. If those fees were netted out of both revenues and cost of revenues, our consolidated non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter would have been approximately 190 basis points higher. Both cash flows from operations and free cash flow were robust this quarter at $177.5 million and $162.7 million, respectively, primarily driven by higher revenue collections. Cash flow in the quarter was impacted by approximately $22 million of incremental due to Section 174. On a pro forma basis, excluding the incremental Section 174 cash taxes of $112 million, our year-to-date free cash flow would be approximately $300 million, up 41% over last year. We continue to prioritize repayment of our term debt as a use of our cash flow. And in Q3, we reduced our term debt by $135 million. We ended Q3 with total outstanding debt of $740 million and cash and investments of approximately $153 million. Our net leverage at quarter end was approximately 1.24 times trailing 12-month pro forma EBITDA. Our updated 2023 guidance is as follows: We expect total revenues will be between $1.942 billion and $1.962 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 7.5%. We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be between $3.82 and $3.96 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock option activity on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $7.66 and $7.80. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $24 million, including approximately $5 million of non-cash amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release and in the Q3 earnings deck posted on our website. In conjunction with our guidance for the full year, I'd like to remind you of the seasonality around our transaction revenues. While transaction revenues will grow year-over-year, as expected, they declined sequentially in Q3 and will decline sequentially again in Q4. Historically, transaction revenues are driven by two primary factors; state-determined deadlines like corporate filings and hunting seasons and the number of business days. Transaction revenues are typically at the highest in Q2, coinciding with peak outdoor seasons and tax deadlines. Transactions are at a seasonal low in the fourth quarter with fewer business days and less activity around the holidays. As we noted previously, we are also seeing the revenue impact of a midyear contractual changes in one of our state enterprise agreements that include a move from a gross to net model for payments. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn.
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. We're making solid progress every quarter to deliver our near and long-term objectives that we discussed in detail at our Investor Day earlier this year. Consistent with our track record, we continue to scale our enterprise while capturing more efficiencies as we transform into a largely pure cloud business, supported by a unified One Tyler strategy. Our strong year-to-date performance, underpinned by our powerful financial algorithm, strong balance sheet and our unique ability to deliver mission-critical software solutions, enabling the public sector's ongoing digital transformation. We're also proud that 11 of our state partners won E-Republic Government Experience Awards. Our clients in Utah, Mississippi, Indiana, Arkansas and Virginia swept the top 5 spots in the GovEx awards. Our momentum continues to build as we complete this pivotal year in our cloud transition. Our team is excited about the tremendous opportunity ahead of us, and we look forward to sharing our continued progress as we finish out 2023. Now we'd like to open the line for Q&A
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from the line of Matthew VanVliet with BTIG. Your line is live.
Matthew VanVliet: Yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, when you look at the ongoing portfolio of company -- or of customers that are looking to make cloud migrations and the overall flips there and then some of the net new business, I know you've highlighted public safety in the past as probably being a laggard longer term. But it seems like momentum of cloud deals there is starting to pick up. Do you anticipate that encouraging more of your existing customers to make those flips? How are those conversations going? And ultimately, how much upside do you feel like there's still left on the public safety side as you get more momentum in the cloud there?
Lynn Moore: Yeah, Matt, that's a good question. And you're right. Historically, public safety has been a little bit slower to adopt. We're seeing that change -- I hesitate to say rapidly, but we are starting to see the momentum shift and the pendulum change a little bit. We're seeing it in the deals that we're doing. We're seeing it in the acceptance of our clients. I'd say more so still on the RMS, the record side. Mobility is already there, but you're seeing a little bit of on the CAD side. Just this past quarter, actually, we did a deal with Manassas, Virginia, where they were on-camp -- on-prem CAD RMS client and we flipped them over to SaaS. So I think just like the rest of the businesses, that as the market continues to gain acceptance the momentum will continue to grow. And we're pretty optimistic and look out into 2024 that the number of flips and the number of SaaS deals will continue to grow at a faster pace, albeit still not a majority of the business yet.
Matthew VanVliet: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thanks for your question. Our next question is from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is live.
Kirk Materne: Yeah. Thanks very much. Congrats on the quarter, guys. Lynn, can you just give a little bit more color on what you're seeing sort of across some of the product categories in terms of SaaS bookings, meaning activity levels maybe on ERP versus Courts & Justice versus public safety? Just kind of a little bit more color on that might be helpful. Just trying to get a sense of where you're seeing momentum. And any color, I guess, on public safety into the fourth quarter too would also be helpful. Thanks.
Lynn Moore: Yeah. I think, generally speaking, across our entire portfolio, we're either -- with the exception of public safety and probably our platform solutions, but all our other ones are -- we're pretty much leading first with SaaS. Deals -- our budgets around SaaS are high. And ERP I think we're north of 90%. Courts & Justice is high. The two market areas that are a little bit slower still are public safety platform solutions, which is our federal space. But even there, the modernization efforts that are going on at the federal government is really starting to shift that pendulum to SaaS as well. So for the overall majority of our business, we're -- the demand is there and the market receptiveness is there. And it's starting -- the momentum for those other two pieces are starting to go forward. When you look at our licenses, licenses now are about 2% of our total revenues. Most of that -- a lot of those license deals are coming out of those two other divisions even as there still are some licenses, pockets of licenses around the rest of the business.
Kirk Materne: Thanks. I’ll hop back in the queue.
Operator: Thanks for your question. Our next question is from the line of Joshua Reilly with Needham. Your line is live.
Joshua Reilly: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Nice job on the quarter here. Our checks indicated that the MicroPact business had a pretty strong pipeline coming into Q3 here, which makes sense with the fiscal year-end for the federal government. Can you just give some more color on how these deals closed and how -- anything to note on the cross-sell into the NIC state contracts that might be adjacent with the MicroPact business? And is there any more of these deals that potentially fell into the fourth quarter? Thank you.
Lynn Moore: Yeah, I'll start. I didn't quite hear all that, Brian. So I'll let you jump in. But yes, so our platform solutions, Q3 is normally their strongest quarter. They had that really strong deal with the National Guard Bureau. There was a fairly significant license deal that slipped and probably got pushed to 2024, and it was really around some uncertainty with the federal government funding as Q3 was coming to a close and the move of some funds to what the Feds consider to be more mission critical. The number of deals that we're doing and the pipeline of deals that we're doing at Federal continues to grow, but there still are some very large deals that can swing quarter-to-quarter. A lot of times, once that sort of window passes in Q3, there's still a volume of deals that happen in Q4, Q1, Q2,-- but the sense of urgency is probably not quite the same as it is as you get into late Q2 and into Q3.
Brian Miller: Yes. And on the cross-sell, the opportunities with our application platform, the formerly called MicroPact entellitrak product, remains one of the strongest opportunities and one of the areas where we're seeing the most activity in terms of leveraging the digital solutions state contracts to sell that into those states. And we had a couple of deals this quarter that we mentioned in the prepared remarks in different applications. I think in Louisiana and Indiana, where we've seen progress. And we've seen a number of those deals since the acquisition of NIC and that continues to be an opportunity that we're pursuing actively.
Lynn Moore: Yeah. I mean, the synergy between what we do at federal and the state market is really strong. As Brian mentioned, we're seeing more pipeline there. And really because when you think about the state government and what they're doing, a lot of what they're doing is case management. And our application platform really sort of serves those modernization needs. Less expensive, it's nimbler, it's built for government. It's enhanced by our mobility, our D&I, our payments. So we do see that synergy, and I think it's something that's going to become more of a focus for us as we look into 2024 and 2025.
Joshua Reilly: Thanks guys. Nice job on the quarter.
Operator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of Rob Oliver with Baird.
Rob Oliver: Great. Hi, thanks. Good morning. In the prepared remarks, you called out the Naperville, Illinois win in public safety. And it sounds like that was a cross-sell on Courts & Justice. So just curious if that's a path you guys are -- you called out because you're seeing success there. Obviously, the Tyler One vision, those being tied together would make a lot of sense. But is that a go-to-market play that you see driving increased wins for public safety in the future here? Thank you.
Lynn Moore: I do. I think we talk about it with our Connected Communities vision and sort of the leverage and power we can create between our public safety and our enterprise justice visions. It was a really good win. It was a good win because it was a very competitive deal. As you'd imagine, it was a license deal of over $1 million. So those are always going to be competitive. And I think part to your point as well, we actually did a smaller deal in California this past quarter. That was with Ameriposta County Sheriff's Office out in California, and that was really leveraging the enterprise justice contract to bring Tyler corrections there. Important deal because we hadn't really had a win in California in a little bit of time and leveraging our relationship with -- on the Courts & Justice side and leveraging that contract was something that got us in the door, and I think an opportunity to expand not only in that department, but also in California.
Rob Oliver: Great. Thanks for the color. Appreciate it. 
Operator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of Terry Tillman with Truist Securities. Your line is live.
Connor Passarella: Great. Good morning. This is Connor Passarella on for Terry. Appreciate you taking the question. Just curious on the payments business and how we should be thinking about organic growth going forward in that segment. And then also just on the payment disbursement use cases that have progressed since the acquisition of Rapid Financial last year. Thank you.
Lynn Moore: I'll start with the use cases. Right now, Rapid, when we bought them, they were primarily in the court space, and that's our primary focus right now. We're in the process. We're early in our 2024 budgeting, thinking about the investments and the various other disbursement cases that we want to put our money towards. So I'm not going to give you our R&D time line right now or our priorities, but we're in the process of doing that. We -- as we've talked before, I think the opportunities across the Tyler solutions is pretty expansive on the disbursement side. We've talked before, I think, as big as on the acquiring side. But currently, right now, the focus is primarily still in the courts area.
A –Brian Miller : Yes. And on the expectations for growth rates around payments, at Investor Day, we broadly talked about an expectation of transaction revenues growing in the 10% to 13% range and expanding margins there over the next several years. As we've said, we're in the very early innings of executing on the cross-sell opportunity of driving payments more deeply into our local government customer base. And so we're still ramping that up, seeing good success in expanding those numbers of new deals each quarter. But generally, that 10% to 13% CAGR for transaction revenues is our expectation over the next few years.
Connor Passarella: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Your line is live.
Alex Zukin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess maybe just two quick ones for me. Bookings look like it took a step up this quarter after the last -- particularly over the last couple of quarters. So I wanted to just understand the outperformance there. Is that accomplished year or incremental momentum? And then same question. Obviously, cash flow looked like it meaningfully outperformed, at least our estimates and I think consensus. So just an understanding of was there anything onetime there? And how should we think about it for Q4? And then just any color, Brian, on the specific elements around some of the cloud -- or SaaS statement? This quarter, what drove that? And how should we think about that going forward?
A –Brian Miller : Yes. So a couple of things there. Cash flow, most of the outperformance was -- you see it in the working capital side and just really strong collections around our revenues driving good performance around our receivables. I think we're continuing to see the impact of more and more recurring revenues and the positive cash flow characteristics around that. Not really any onetime things there. But I think that our expectation for the year has ratcheted up a little bit. I think right now, even after the impact of the Section 174 cash taxes, which the biggest impact was in the first half of the year, I think we said there's a $22 million impact on cash taxes this quarter, back around the $15 million incremental taxes in Q4. But I think our expectation for the full year now is more in the $220 million to $240 million range for free cash flow, which is up from where we thought last quarter. We did make some minor reclasses in the historical data, the split between -- in subscription, so all in the subscription category on the face of our income statement. But in the breakout of those, between transaction revenues and SaaS revenues. As we transition to a new financial system this quarter, we had better clarity on some of the mapping of the revenues, primarily from acquisitions since NIC and reclassified those somewhat between transactions and SaaS. So we've just sort of cleaned up some of those historical numbers. Don't expect any more changes going forward.
Alex Zukin: Got it. And what about on the bookings side?
A –Brian Miller : Yes, the booking side, we talked about this, it can be kind of lumpy. But generally, the -- really a reflection of kind of the combination of all the new SaaS business, the new increases in the transaction business, which kind of run through bookings at the same time as they run through revenues. And just the combination of all that led to a stronger quarter this quarter. We didn't have any of the mega deals, but we did have a really solid flow of new SaaS deals, some -- a couple of not super large but meaningful license deals this quarter and then pretty good activity around the expansions with existing customers as well. So it's pretty broad-based, but again not driven by super large contracts, but nice growth across all of our revenue streams.
Alex Zukin: Perfect. Thank you guys.
Operator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays. Your line is live.
Saket Kalia: Okay. Great. Hey, Lynn. Hey, Brian, thanks for taking my question here. Brian maybe for you. I'd love to dig into the restatements just one level deeper. So can you just walk through what some of the -- one of -- I guess, what some of the items were from the NIC business that are now SaaS versus transaction? And maybe the follow-on is how would your SaaS revenue growth have looked I guess, excluding the restatement? I know that I think it's about 26% year-over-year growth this quarter. What would that have been under the old convention, which is what our model is kind of currently are based on? Does that make sense?
Brian Miller: Yes. I don't have that number in front of me. They're not restatements. In the financial statements, they were always all in subscription revenues. It's in the...
Saket Kalia: That’s fair, it’s a reclass. That's fair. It's a reclass not a restatement, Brian.
Brian Miller: Some of those were -- when we originally acquired NIC and before we basically had almost all their revenues classified in our transaction category. And some of the revenues from a contract can have sort of a blend of some SaaS revenues and transaction revenues around those. So they're providing some software services but getting paid with transaction fees. And so sometimes there's some boring between that. Also, when we acquired the VendEngine acquisition, we initially made an additional judgment from their financials of how those revenues should be spread. And with a deeper understanding of those, we start to map those to our new financial system. We just found that some of those were more appropriately classified a different way. So those are all relatively minor reclassifications as well. So I don't think there's a big change in the trend, but...
Saket Kalia: But maybe just to maybe understand that a little bit better because 26% growth is quite a bit higher than what we were seeing before. I mean, was that mix -- that the newly added SaaS revenue there, was that growing significantly faster than sort of what I'll call the old SaaS revenue that was in there? Because it is quite a bit higher than what it was before. So I just -- I wanted to make sure I just kind of flesh that out.
Brian Miller: No, no. There's not a significant change from that. That's not really accelerating it. The 26% growth is actually an acceleration this quarter. But again, we said that will maybe move around from quarter-to-quarter. But generally, we expect this around the 20% CAGR over the next couple of years in SaaS revenue. Some quarters, it may be higher. And as we talked about, some of that variability from quarter-to-quarter has to do with the lag from when we sign a new SaaS deal to when those revenues hit, which can be a quarter or two occasionally longer.
Saket Kalia: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Your line is live.
Jonathan Ho: Hi, good morning and thank you for taking my question. Just wanted to better understand sort of the AI opportunity that you're seeing out there and sort of the rationale for making the acquisitions at this time. Just given state and local governments typically adopt technologies a little bit more slowly, how do you think about sort of driving these types of solutions? What does the opportunity look like? Just want to get the broader color. Thank you.
Lynn Moore: Yes, sure, Jonathan. Obviously, it's a pretty rapidly evolving landscape. There's a lot that's in the news, some of it may be a little more hype. But it's real. And we see AI benefits within Tyler, we're kind of looking at it in two different ways. We're looking at it sort of pointing it internally, things that we're doing, how can we make ourselves more efficient by using AI. Because I think one of the biggest benefits around AI really is when you're talking about sort of high-volume repetitive tasks, which there are pieces of our business that do that, whether it's some software coding, it may be some things around some support, things like that. The other side of it is how do we make our products more competitive and differentiate them more? What we've done internally is we've organized a working group that's been in place for several quarters, looking at all the various opportunities. There's pockets of AI going on all around Tyler right now. We want to take -- not surprisingly, what we always do at Tyler is sort of a deliberate targeted approach. Sort of we're in the process of identifying what are the couple of key areas that we want to focus on in both of those scenarios, whether we're pointing it internally around creating more efficiencies or adding more competitiveness to our products. The CSI acquisition is a great example of that. They really started off as a sort of a document redaction sort of extraction leader. Recently, they've added some machine learning and robotic process automation. This is something that all of our core clients need and some of our core clients were already using. Tarrant County, which is here out in Fort Worth, they've utilized the CSI acquisition and what it saved in their personnel costs, this is their numbers not mine. they're saying they've cut their labor costs by 50% by sort of automating some of these more repetitive things around documents which, of course, there's a lot there. So even the CSI acquisition, we were just talking earlier the Rapid acquisition. Initially, it's in the court space, that's where we're pointing it. But we also see a lot of places and leverage it across other platforms in Tyler, whether it's things in our ERP space like invoice processing and things like that. So a lot of applicability. You're right, states and clients are -- they're taking different approaches, and we're going to take that deliberate approach with our clients.
Operator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of Clarke Jeffries with Piper Sandler. Your line is live.
Clarke Jeffries: Good morning Thank you for taking the question. I apologize, I'm maybe going to beat a dead horse and ask a little bit more questions about the reclass. But specifically, looking at SaaS ARR either pre-reclass or post reclass, been in this mid-single-digit sequential growth paradigm. And what stood out was an acceleration of maybe a high single-digit sequential growth in ARR. And so, Brian, I wanted to ask, is this a reflection of maybe the good bookings you had last year and some of those deals finally reaching the timing where they would be going live in revenue terms? Or was there a change being made in the business, either on a capacity level or a new bookings level that we may not appreciate that contributed to an acceleration in ARR growth? Thank you.
Brian Miller: Yes. Clarke, I think it's more the latter. So it's more of that timing. So good bookings, it could be as much as a year ago or longer, that -- where we signed new SaaS deals that some of those are now more fully reflected in the revenue run rate as well as flips. So obviously, the pace of flips has been accelerating over the last couple of years, continues to accelerate. But again, from the time -- the numbers we announced each quarter, the contract signed for flips this quarter, so that revenue uplift shifting from maintenance to SaaS, typically, call it, a 1.7x multiple, there's a lag from that. So the flips we signed last year or last quarter or the quarter before, some of those are now seeing the revenue uplift. So there's just sort of a lag from -- which is different than some SaaS companies, that lag from the time of contract signed to the time that those revenues start to hit our income statement. So I think that's more of that acceleration. And as we continue to increase the pace of flips and grow -- move more of the new business to SaaS, you'll continue to see that accelerate, although with a lag.
Clarke Jeffries: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs. Your line is live.
Kelly Valenti: Hi. This is Kelly Valenti on for Gabriela. One for Mobi [ph]. Last quarter, you made very specific comments on RFP and demo activity at or above pre-COVID highs, while it sounds like top of funnel remains strong. What are you seeing in the back half of this year compared to that dynamic that you were seeing in the first half? And then are there any idiosyncracies of the government end market making you more or less bullish on RFP and demo activity next year?
Lynn Moore: Yeah. Thanks, Kelly. I would say it's been a strong year. And I would say we characterize that in the first half of the year is very strong. And I would say it's -- right now, it's steady at that pace. Overall, the markets just seem healthy. The budgets are still strong. The activity is strong and our win rates are good. So I don't see any real meaningful change across our business lines from comments we've made in the first couple of quarters.
Operator: Thank you for your question. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of David Unger with Wells Fargo. Your line is live.
David Unger: Great. Thank you guys. So it's great to see the net leverage coming down to 1.25 times EBITDA. Can you just remind us how you guys like to think about that leverage band and maybe some color around private market valuations? Thank you.
Lynn Moore: Yeah. Thanks, David. Sure. As you know, we've been prioritizing debt paydown a lot at the same time while we're still looking at other deals. I'm excited to -- once we dropped under 1.5 net leverage, our rate in our bank changed, and we were able to achieve that at the end of Q3. So that's encouraging. We've paid over about $1 billion of debt down. Brian talked earlier about the impact of Section 174 taxes and the pro forma free cash flow. We'd actually be out of term debt or pretty close to out of term debt right now, absent that, which is encouraging. As it relates to private market valuations there, I would say there's -- we're starting to see in the market and the deals and the things that we're hearing that expectations are finally starting to change. It's always been a little bit amazing to me that when you see things going on in the public markets and yet the private sector deals or people still think that the market should be where it was a couple of years ago. We're still pretty disciplined in how we look at acquisitions. So in areas when private expectations still are too high, we'll simply pass on the deal. We're pretty excited to get these 3 deals done, 1 in Q3 and the ones that we announced earlier this week. These are good deals. These are good business deals, things that are going to help drive our growth, things that will leverage the growth drivers that we outlined in Tyler 2030. And they're going to be accretive to revenues and margins over in pretty short order. So it's interesting, too. There's a lot of companies went private equity in the last few years. And I think we're going to start seeing a time when we're going to start spinning back out. And historically, I think they paid pretty high premiums. It's going to be interesting to see what happens in the markets, but our disciplined approach to how we do things isn't going to change.
Brian Miller: And just to add to Lynn's comment about leverage and our comfort level, we've never been highly leveraged and don't see a scenario where we really would be given the predictability and the strength of our cash flow, especially around our recurring revenues. When we did the NIC acquisition, we were, I think, around or maybe above 3x leverage and certainly very comfortable there. Our lenders are very comfortable there. And as we said, we're focused on deleveraging, especially as interest rates rose and have done that very rapidly. But I think we have a lot of capacity as well. But within that band up to the kind of 3, 3.5 times, where we're very comfortable.
David Unger: Appreciate that. Thank you gentlemen.
Operator: Thank you for your question. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Pete Heckmann with D.A. Davidson. Your line is live.
Pete Heckmann: Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to see if you had any preliminary thoughts on the potential for the Federal Reserve to cut debit interchange and whether based on the convenience fee model that NIC had, whether a lower interchange might be a benefit to margins?
Lynn Moore: I think the short answer is no, I don't have any preliminary thoughts on it. Obviously, we watch all these types of things that are going on in the markets, particularly as we think about our long-term plans and views. I'm certainly not in a position to think one way or the other of where -- what anybody in Washington is going to do a little on the Fed. But -- so I'd say right now, I don't have any real comment on that.
Pete Heckmann: Okay. And then just a housekeeping item, Brian. Were there any single deals above, let's say, $10 million in TCV in the quarter?
Brian Miller: I don't think we had anything above $10 million in contract value. Our biggest SaaS deal was around $5.5 million in contract value. That was the Minnesota Parks deal. And our biggest license deal was under $5 million total contract value, though it has a lot of options that could drive that significantly higher. But the booked amount was less than $5 million. So no, no -- nothing in that really large size this quarter. A lot of good midsized volume of kind of bread-and-butter deals.
Pete Heckmann: Yeah, yeah. Just a lot of singles and doubles okay, I appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your call and your question. Our next question is from the line of Alexei Gogolev with JPMorgan. Your line is live.
Helen Smith: This is Helen Smith on for Alexei Gogolev from JPMorgan. Thank you for taking my question. So my first question revolves around your private data centers. At your Investor Day, you talked at length that one data center will be closed in 2024 and the other in 2025. Do you have any updates on that front?
Lynn Moore: Yeah, I'd say right now we're on track for what we outlined. We expect our Dallas Center to shut down sort of middle of 2024. And yes, we're still on track for evacuating the other one by the end of 2025.
Helen Smith: Great. Thank you so much. And my second question revolves around security. There have been some pretty high-level security breaches recently out like Clorox and GM, Caesars. I was wondering if this has changed the way that you're working with your customers or if your customers have brought forward any sort of concerns.
Lynn Moore: Well, yes, I mean, security is always an issue and particularly in our business and our clients. I think the thing about what's been going on with cybersecurity is it really highlights the need for our clients to move away from their traditional on-prem type environments, move to the cloud, move to the modernization and digitization efforts. And I think it contributes to that. We've seen clients where -- I talked about it, I think, a couple of quarters ago, we had a client that we were trying to move to a SaaS flip for -- out in Arizona for quite a long time. And unfortunately, they had a ransomware attack, and it was surely after that that we were able to flip them to the cloud. It was a triggering point for their decision. So it's a reality that we all have to live with, and our clients are acutely aware of it because a lot of the public sector clients are targets. But I do think it does help with the sales and understanding about where we need to go in the future together with our clients.
Helen Smith: Great. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you for your quarter. Our next question is from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays. Your line is live.
Saket Kalia: Okay. Great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the follow-up question here. Brian, one follow-up question for you, if I may. Can we just talk a little bit about the blended duration on SaaS bookings this quarter a little bit, putting aside the re-class. I think if we look at SaaS bookings ARR, that expectedly faced the tough comp that we were talking about earlier. So that was down year-over-year pretty decently. But SaaS TCV was actually pretty decent in terms of total bookings. I just wondered if duration was anything to consider there and how you thought about that?
Brian Miller: Not really. Actually, the average term of our new SaaS contracts this quarter was exactly the same as third quarter of last year at 3.8 years. We've said we generally tried to bring that down over recent years and generally lead with a three-year initial term. We certainly have some clients who want a longer term. And so that blended term or that average duration has generally been in that kind of 3.5% to 4% over the last couple of years. But this quarter, yes, that wasn't a factor at all.
Saket Kalia: Got it. Very helpful. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you for your follow-up. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn it back over to Lynn Moore, President and CEO, for closing comments.
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Aaron, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to Brian Miller or myself. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's Tyler Technologies Third Quarter 2023 Conference Call. Have a great rest of your day.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-27 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to today's Tyler Technologies Second Quarter 2023 Conference Call. Your host for today's call is Lynn Moore, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, July 27, 2023. I would like to turn the call over to Hala Elsherbini, Tyler's Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Hala Elsherbini: Thank you, Colby, and welcome to our call. With me today is Lynn Moore, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. After I give the safe harbor statement, Lynn will have some additional comments on our quarter and then Brian will review the details of our results and provide an update to our annual guidance. Lynn will end with some additional comments, and then we'll take your questions. During this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information and may include projections concerning the company's future results, future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Also, in our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financials tab schedules with supplemental information, including information about our quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. On the Events and Presentations tab, we posted an earnings summary slide deck to supplement our prepared remarks. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Lynn?
Lynn Moore : Thanks, Hala. Tyler delivered exceptionally strong second quarter results that exceeded expectations across our key performance measures. We also reached a new milestone for total quarterly revenues surpassing the $500 million mark for the first time. Our results reflect a high level of execution and collaborative one Tyler approach across our organization that is the foundation of our long-term growth strategy. Total revenue growth was 7.6% with 10.4% organic growth. Recurring revenue comprised 82% of our quarterly revenues and grew organically almost 11%. It's gratifying to achieve double-digit revenue growth even as the shift to SaaS in our new software contract mix continue to accelerate, with SaaS deals comprising 82% of our Q2 new software contract value. Most importantly, SaaS revenues grew organically 20%, our tenth consecutive quarter of SaaS revenue growth of 20% or more. At the start of the year, we characterized 2023 as a pivotal year in our cloud transition where the significant decline in license revenue is replaced by valuable long-term recurring SaaS revenue. Now halfway through the year, the accelerated pace of cloud adoption coupled with our heightened focus on our cloud optimization and migration efforts position us well to drive sustained long-term growth and operating margin improvement. While operating margins this quarter declined from last year as expected due to our cloud transitions, margins were better than planned because of operating efficiencies. We continue to deliver results that reflect our competitive strengths and market-leading position in the public sector. Key to our performance is our hyper focus on leveraging our largest asset, our unmatched installed client base to drive an increasing number of cross-sell and upsell wins, prioritize migration of on-premises clients to the cloud and capture higher transaction volumes through our unified payment solution. Overall, sales activity is high in what we see as a robust demand environment, with leading indicators such as RFPs and demos generally at or above pre-COVID highs. In addition to software solutions, our unified payment strategy in our Digital Solutions division continued to prove their tremendous value to our growth algorithm. During the second quarter, we signed 132 new payment deals, including a contract with Cook County, Illinois for traffic court payments. We also signed renewals of our state enterprise contracts in Wisconsin and Connecticut, and extensions of our state enterprise agreements in West Virginia, Illinois, Idaho, New Jersey and Kentucky. Additionally, synergies from our disbursements business through our acquisition of Rapid Financial Solutions, and deals influenced by data and insights continue to materialize and provide compelling offerings in the state and federal markets. I'd like to highlight a few strategic second quarter deals that illustrate these successes. We've seen growing momentum in the public safety market with our best first half sales performance since we acquired New World in 2015. During the second quarter, we signed contracts with 2 state police organizations for enterprise CAD and mobility solutions. These marquee license agreements include a cloud deployment for the Oregon State Police and an on-premises deployment for the Missouri State Highway Patrol. Additionally, Harris County, Texas, the third largest county in the United States, selected Tyler's enforcement mobile solution for eCitations and eCrash applications. We want a cross-sell opportunity with Michigan Bureau of Elections, a Digital Solutions division client to replace an existing custom solution with Tyler's application platform, formerly entellitrak with $1.7 million of ARR. We also added our enterprise licensing platform and 1 outdoor solution under our state enterprise agreement in Illinois with $5.2 million of ARR. 94 clients signed contracts to migrate on-premises Tyler solutions to the cloud, including the Cab County, Georgia, for their enterprise justice solution; Charleston, West Virginia for their enterprise ERP solution and the Wyoming State control for their public safety solution. Now I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our annual guidance for 2023.
Brian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. Total revenues for the quarter were $504.3 million, up 7.6%. Organic revenue growth, which also excludes COVID-related revenues in 2022 was 10.4%. Last year's second quarter included $15.2 million of revenues from COVID-related initiatives at our Digital Solutions division, formerly NIC, all of which ended in 2022. Subscriptions revenues increased 16.4% and organically rose 16%. Within subscriptions, our SaaS revenues grew 20% to $131.5 million and transaction revenues grew 13.7% to $166.3 million. On an organic basis, transaction revenues grew 12.8%. License revenue declined 34.8% as our new software contract mix continued to shift to SaaS at an accelerated pace with SaaS deals comprising 82% of our Q2 new software contract value compared to 74% last year. Professional services revenue declined 7.7% due to the absence of COVID-related revenues but rose 12.9% organically. We added 170 new SaaS arrangements and converted 94 existing on-premises clients to SaaS, with a total contract value of approximately $93 million. In Q2 of last year, we added 167 new SaaS arrangements and had 96 on-premises conversions, with a total contract value of approximately $115 million. As a reminder, in last year's second quarter, we signed a $20 million SaaS contract for a digital motor vehicle titling solution in New Jersey. Our total annualized recurring revenue was approximately $1.66 billion up 11.2% and organically grew 11.6%. Operating margins in the quarter were once again pressured by the acceleration of the shift to the cloud in new business and the related decline in license revenues. We've also seen expenses associated with employee health benefits grow well above planned levels during the first half of the year, and we remain cautious about future increases for the balance of the year and next year. As we previously stated, we expect operating margins to trough in 2023 and the return to a trajectory of margin expansion in 2024. As we also discussed in prior quarters, merchant and interchange fees from our payments business under the gross revenue model have a meaningful impact on our overall margins. In Q2, we paid merchant fees of approximately $44 million. If those fees were netted out of both revenues and cost of revenues, our consolidated non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter would have been approximately 220 basis points higher. Both cash flows from operations and free cash flow were negative this quarter at $19.2 million negative and $33.2 million, respectively, mainly due to incremental cash tax payments of approximately $90 million related to the current status of IRC Section 174 capitalization rules. On a pro forma basis, excluding the Section 174 cash taxes, our year-to-date free cash flow would be approximately $120 million, up 19% over last year. We did not pay down term debt in Q2 due to the elevated cash tax payments, but we expect to continue to prioritize debt payments as our cash flow accelerates in the second half of the year. We ended Q2 with total outstanding debt of $875 million and cash and investments of approximately $148 million and net leverage at quarter end of approximately 1.55x trailing 12-month pro forma EBITDA. Our updated 2023 guidance is as follows: We expect total revenues will be between $1.94 billion and $1.965 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 8%. We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be between $3.87 and $4.02 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock option activity on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $7.60 and $7.75. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $25 million including approximately $5 million of noncash amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release and in the Q2 earnings deck posted on our website. In conjunction with our guidance for the full year, I'd like to remind you of the seasonality around our transaction revenues. While transaction revenues will grow year-over-year, we expect they will decline sequentially in Q3 and again in Q4. Historically, transaction revenues are driven by 2 primary factors: They determine deadlines like corporate filings and hunting seasons and the number of business days. Transaction revenues typically are at the highest in Q2 coinciding with peak outdoor seasons and tax deadlines. Transactions are at a seasonal low in the fourth quarter with fewer business days and less activity around the holidays. In addition, starting in Q3, we'll see the revenue impact of contractual changes in one of our state enterprise agreements that includes a move from a gross to net model for payments. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn.
Lynn Moore : Thanks, Brian. We finished a strong quarter and first half performance excelled across our business. The quarter was highlighted by 2 highly successful events: Connect 2023, which was our most attended user conference to date with nearly 6,000 attendees and our first stand-alone investor event in 4 years, where we unveiled our Tyler 2030 vision and key growth pillars driving our strategic direction toward organic recurring revenue long-term CAGR of 10% to 12%, sustainable margin expansion with non-GAAP operating margins of 30% or greater and expanded free cash flow of $1 billion and free cash flow margins in the high 20s. If you didn't attend our Investor Day in person or virtually, we invite you to watch the replay or access the presentations on our website. It's an exciting time in Tyler's next era of growth, and we see a clear pathway to achieve our mid- and long-term goals, guided by a well-defined growth strategy and powerful financial algorithm to deliver sustained value creation and support our public sector clients digitally empowered future. Now we'd like to open the line for Q&A.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Pete Heckmann from D.A. Davidson.
Pete Heckmann: Can you talk a little bit about the ERP business and whether you've seen any changing dynamics there competitively. I always thought it was interesting that some of the big horizontal ERP companies really just focused on the top tier. But are you seeing any instances of some players, maybe like Workday coming down into the mid-tier where Tyler has historically been very strong?
Lynn Moore: Yes, sure, Pete. I think to start the background, the ERP market is really strong right now. Market activity is good. It's -- RFPs are up, demos are up. I think we commented on that at the end of the first quarter earnings call. It is a very competitive market. We do see Workday more so at the top end, as you mentioned -- more so in larger deals. And really, we see them more in deals where clients may be driven more from an HR point solution rather than a suite solution, and they compete very well there. We think over the long term that having a suite of products that's fully integrated is the best bet. And we're competing well when we compete on that front.
Pete Heckmann: Okay. And then in terms of like some of the dynamics around in-to-out migrations, it seems like that's continuing a pace. I guess are there any pockets of either certain software products that will need to be upgraded before they can be moved into the cloud or just certain areas where the customer base has maybe been more reluctant where you think they could be hold out in terms of eventually moving to the cloud?
Lynn Moore : Yes. No, that's right. That's one of the -- I think we talked a little bit about that at the investor conference. One of the, I guess, hurdles to getting people into the cloud and getting them upgraded and migrated is -- some of them are on older versions and that's something that we're consciously attacking across all our product lines, trying to get to version collapse. Some divisions are a little more ahead than others. But I think it also sort of highlights what I've said a lot of times is Tyler is not really going through a single cloud transition. It's going through multiple cloud transitions, because we have multiple core applications who are in different stages with different versions out there, different technology, different beginning points, different endpoints. And so it's kind of -- it's a lot of moving parts. But yes, that's certainly a key factor that plays across all of them and different products are in different points right now.
Brian Miller: And I'll just add to that, that public safety is probably the area that lags both in terms of adoption of new customers of the cloud and migration of existing customers. But that is changing. We're seeing a continuous move towards a higher percentage of the new public safety deals coming to us in the cloud. And this year, we've had our first 2 flips of on-prem public safety clients to the cloud 1 in Q1 and then the Wyoming State Patrol this quarter.
Pete Heckmann : Okay. That’s good to hear. I appreciate it. I’ll get back in the queue.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew VanVliet from BTIG.
Matthew VanVliet: I guess as we look at the strength of the SaaS business and especially on the SaaS bookings, I wonder if you could help us think through maybe the cadence of the bookings throughout the quarter? Were they a little bit more back-end weighted? or anything from sort of a timing perspective? And then a second part there is we seem to have seen some of the best organic growth in a number of quarters here. So business is performing well. But maybe think about why you didn't maybe raise the midpoint of the revenue guidance for the year, just sort of what went into the process of essentially maintaining the midpoint on the guidance there.
Brian Miller: Yes. I’d say the cadence of bookings has been pretty normal. Our bookings typically are not terribly back-end loaded. They tend to be – within a quarter, they tend to be generally spread throughout the quarter. We obviously have some push to get things in at the end of the quarter, but probably different than some of the businesses, software businesses that are focused on the private sector. So I don’t think there’s anything unusual this quarter. As we said, it continues to be a pretty robust market with a lot of activity. In terms of the revenue guidance, typically, we’re not making big changes in that through the early part of the year. We did narrow the range. So more confident around where the bottom end and the top end are, but our expectations really haven’t changed. It’s more around the timing. This quarter, there were a few deals that happened maybe a little earlier than we planned in the year, but our outlook for the full year really hasn’t changed much of then to narrow.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Terry Tillman from Truist Securities.
Terry Tillman: And maybe, Lynn, first question for you is in terms of unified payments and you called out 132 payment deals. I'm just curious on that kind of revenue synergy side and now taking into account new use cases around disbursements. How does the back half look in terms of kind of building confidence in these revenue synergies? And can you keep building on top of like 132 payment deals as we move into 3Q and beyond just a little bit more around -- could we see more goodness where you've seen so far?
Lynn Moore: Yes. Terry, that's a good question. I think payments is an area where it continues to even outbeat our internal plan. And so my expectation is that's going to continue. It's something that we push with every deal. It's the more that we get involved, it's also involved in a lot of our inside sales, which also continues to outpace quarter after quarter. As it relates to Rapid, we're still pretty early. We're what 9 months, 8 months into the Rapid acquisition. We've got a lot of good traction. We've got a lot of deals that are in the works that are really pretty exciting deals that we wouldn't have without Rapid and that are going to add really some extra revenues down the road. So where we are with payments right now is I'm excited about where we are. I'm really excited about the Rapid deal. It's something that's being pushed throughout our entire sales channel, and I would expect that to continue to grow.
Brian Miller: And I would point out that there is a lag typically from the time we sign a new payments deal to the time those revenues start hitting the income statement. It might be a quarter or 2, it might be longer. They often -- we're replacing an incumbent payments provider and so there may be some time period for that change to take place? Or the payments are associated with the implementation of a new solution like the utility billing solution. And so those payments start when that new system is implemented. So the fact that we're continuing to see a growing number of new deals signed, bodes well for future revenue growth in that area, but it is an instant.
Terry Tillman: Got it. I guess, maybe, Brian, just a follow-up question, and then I'll get back in the queue is -- it was good to call out that the lumpiness in large deal kind of exposure that you all have. So the $20 million deal, if you back it out, I mean the software contract value was down a little bit year-over-year. It sounds like year-to-date, there's been robust demand activity. But I'm just kind of curious, was there smaller large deals in the quarter and compared to maybe last year's 2Q? And then -- and is there anything we should call out into 3Q that you anniversary like a big deal like last year in 2Q?
Brian Miller: Yes, it was a tough comp from a bookings perspective. This year, our biggest deal was an $8.8 million total contract value in the Michigan Bureau of elections. And we -- on the SaaS side and then we had I guess, 5 other deals that were worth more than $2 million and one large license deal, the Missouri Highway Control deal. Last year, we had the New Jersey deal, which was a $20 million deal. So we don't have anything that approached that size deal this year. And we also had a $13 million license deal with the tax system in Montreal. So there were just a number of large deals last year. This year was much more, I'd say, kind of normal. In Q3, I don't believe we have a meaningful sort of comp issue. I think our biggest license deal was a $2.5 million deal. And we did have -- on the SaaS side, we did have a very large deal with the State Department last year in Q3, which was a total contract value of north of $50 million. And we had a statewide supervision deal, that was a $15 million SaaS deal. So those will make for a difficult comp on the SaaS side next quarter.
Lynn Moore : Yes. I think what's interesting there, Terry, is while there were no huge mega deals this quarter, really across the board, all of our divisions are outperforming plan and what they're seeing in their sales and in their pipeline and in their activity. So typically, there's always puts and takes, but really -- this is really just a strong quarter across the board, both from a revenue standpoint and an execution standpoint.
Brian Miller: We've talked for a long time about the lumpiness of those mega deals. They come along from time to time. We -- in some of these product areas where like Courts & Justice and tax, we're very well positioned to win those, but they're not here every quarter. So they do create some lumpiness, whether it's SaaS or license bookings.
Terry Tillman : Understood. Good look into 3Q. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges from Goldman Sachs.
Gabriela Borges: I wanted to follow up on the comment on RFPs and demos now being at or above pre-COVID highs. Would love to get a little bit of color, how much of that is activity changing at the customer versus maybe Tyler specific initiatives? And is there any reason to think that the quality of these RFPs and demos could be better or worse? In other words, how do you think about conversion rates for some of this great top of funnel pipeline activity relative to the history?
Lynn Moore: Yes, Gabriela. I think it's just -- the RFPs and demos up is just a function of the market. And I think there's probably still been a little bit of hangover from COVID, but we're seeing it really across the board, across all of our business units. As it relates to the quality of RFPs, I think there are certain business units where we're actually probably being even a little bit more selective, which I think is going to increase our win rates. I know we're doing that, for example, at public safety. But generally speaking, it's just a healthy market right now.
Brian Miller: I think it is a combination of both, the strength of the market, I think the stimulus is a factor there, but not the major factor, but also the strength of Tyler's broader presence, the ability for us to leverage our customer relationships and see more opportunities and see some of those opportunities sooner through the NIC state contracts and our ability. We talk about RFPs and demos but a growing number of our deals take place without RFPs. So in sole source or deals that bypass that formal RFP process. So that's a positive for us as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Reilly from Needham.
Josh Reilly : Nice job on the quarter here. Subscription and maintenance gross margin was higher in the quarter. Maybe you can give us some color on what drove that increase quarter-over-quarter? And how is the cloud migration impacting gross margin near term here versus some of the operating expense line items?
Brian Miller: Well, I think we continue to see operating efficiencies around a number of aspects of our business, but they’re certainly impacting our recurring revenues and our SaaS business. We’re continuing to be very efficient around managing our staffing levels. We’re seeing some of the efficiency gains, for example, around the Digital Solutions reformer NIC business that from changes that have been made there to operate more efficiently. So as we expect that as the SaaS revenues grow, margins should continue to expand. I think we’re also seeing improved efficiencies around our public cloud, AWS operations and better per unit costs as we add more customers there. So even though we are seeing certainly pressure on margins because of the cloud transition, the things we’ve talked about, the bubble costs around – until we exit our proprietary data centers, we are seeing efficiency gains around those operations as we continue to scale those.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays.
Saket Kalia: Okay. Great. Brian, maybe just for you. Great to see the SaaS revenue here, I think, continue to grow 20% plus in the quarter. I know that's the CAGR that we talked about at Analyst Day recently, I think, out to '25. So maybe the question is, should we sort of think about this continuing pretty steady in this range in the medium term? Or should we think about just maybe a little bit of a different shape around SaaS revenue over the next couple of years? Just curious how you think about kind of this quarter's growth in the context of that long-term target.
Brian Miller: Yes. I think, in the Investor Day, I think we actually talked about kind of high-teens CAGR over that period collectively from now through 2030. So right now and for the next few years, we'll continue to see a bump to the growth from the flips from our on-prem customers and over time, I mean, that certainly will accelerate over the next few years and then we'll wind down as we talked about the cadence that we expect to convert those customers over. So we are getting higher benefit from those flips and we'll continue to see that. But I think ultimately, it moves more into the teens. But I'd expect to see this growth in this range for the near future.
Saket Kalia: Got it. And then if I could fit in a housekeeping question. Really interesting point you made in your prepared remarks, Brian, just on having one customer switch from gross to net in the payments business here in Q3. Could you just maybe dig into how much of a revenue impact that is in Q3 that we should think about? And is this going to be more of a trend? Or do you think this is a little bit of a one-off?
Brian Miller: Yes. I think we actually talked about that at our – when we gave guidance for the full year. There is 1 state that’s about a $10.5 million that’s changing midyear, so that impact will start to hit this year, and we estimated that at around $10.5 million in the second half of the year, probably a little more of that impact in Q3. It happens really on a state or a customer by customer basis. The vast majority of our business is on the gross model, and we expect that to continue to be the case. Customers generally prefer the certainty and the predictability around having us assume the responsibility for the merchant and interchange fees and have a set percentage that they’re going to pay for their payments processing. There are some customers that are willing to accept that risk around those merchant interchange fees and prefer the net model and sometimes there are changes there as we’ve seen this year. We really – I think we had 2 states that’s been the case with this year. But again, generally, we would expect that the vast majority of our payments business would continue to be on the gross model.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alek Zukin from Wolfe Research.
Ethan Park: This is Ethan Park on Alek Zukin. I have 2 parts here. Just first, can you talk a little bit about the shape of the quarter, just comment a bit about kind of the environment coming in and out of the Analyst Day. And then just a question on the SaaS works. How did it perform just relative to your internal expectations as we look at about a year versus a year ago and just how to think about that trending through the rest of this year and into 2024.
Brian Miller: Yes, the demand environment, as we said in the prepared remarks, is stable or growing generally at or above kind of our pre-COVID highs. So a very robust demand environment coming out of Investor Day and really very similar to what we’ve seen throughout this year and don’t see signs of that changing right now. So stable at a high level. With respect to flips, I’d say generally, we’re performing a long plan – the number of flips is very similar to last year, but the dollar value is higher. So we are seeing bigger customers flip. And I think that will continue to be the case, especially in the early days, flips most of the customers doing that. We’re on the small end today. We’re seeing more of the larger customers. We talked about a couple this quarter that were on the larger side, a large county in Georgia with a court system. As I said, we’ve seen our first couple of public safety customers flip. So I’d say, generally, those migrations are in line with our expectations for the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo Securities.
Michael Turrin: I wanted to go back to something that was asked earlier, but with a slightly different tilt. If we look at the subscription mix as a percent of total contracts, it's very consistent with what we've seen recently. If we look at the TCV and the term metrics, they're down a bit. And this is plus a year-on-year comparison question and more. Just wondering if there's anything to call out in terms of customer behavior, whether it's rising rates or something that might be driving a slightly smaller initial deal size? And then just thinking through if there are impacts that flow into the backlog or bookings numbers that we're looking at. Just wanting to reconcile if there's anything to call out there and just try to kind of calibrate maybe what to expect on those metrics rest of the year?
Brian Miller: Yes. I don’t think there’s anything of note around that. The mix of what deals signed in any given quarter can just vary a lot depending on the timing of when those things happen and what happens to be in the pipeline. So I don’t think there’s a trend to call out or anything, any macro condition that’s affecting. We continue to – if we look at comparison to last year, I think some of those metrics are skewed a bit by those very large deals. But I don’t think there’s anything really notable to call out there, and I’d expect that – generally, we expect to continue to see deal sizes grow over time, but it’s hard to predict exactly what will happen in Q3 or Q4. But I don’t think there’s anything fundamentally changing in the market around that.
Lynn Moore: Yes. I think I would add there that generally, there’s a couple of areas in our business that sign larger deals. Appraisal and tax often has some very large deal, multiyear deals. Our Courts & Justice, Enterprise Justice has some very large deals. And the appraisal tax stuff can be a little cyclical. The large deals are – they come and they go. We’ve talked about it for years. That’s what makes – that’s the 1 reason why we stopped talking about bookings numbers and started focusing on different metrics. I’d go back to my comment earlier today that really performance across the board has been really solid and actually above plan in Q2, which is pretty exciting to see given as well as our competitive position and sort of the demand nature that’s out there right now.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI.
Kirk Materne: Question on sort of flips. I was wondering, Lynn, if you could talk a little bit about when customers are considering moving from on-prem to cloud, is that a cross-sell opportunity as well for you all, meaning when they're having that discussion, has that given you all an opportunity to go in and talk about the sort of other products that might hang off the product they're moving to the cloud. I was just wondering if you have any thought process or if there's anything you could share in terms of what percentage of flips come along with incremental revenue associated with it?
Lynn Moore: Yes. No, that's a good point. And you're right. That's a big part of our sales strategy. And I'd say we actually probably call that more of an upsell opportunity. We talk about cross-sells and upsells. It's an opportunity to add things like our data and insight solutions, our payment solutions as well as just other things. So -- and we talked earlier about how a lot of this requires the customers to upgrade to a newer version of the software, which also opens up doors for other modules and things that are more compatible.
Kirk Materne: And can you talk about just in terms of moving to the cloud, obviously, as people start talking more about generative AI and AI in general, to take advantage of you sort of need to be in the cloud. Has that started to percolate at all as a topic of discussion for customers to move over to the cloud? Or is it still just super early days in the public sector?
Lynn Moore: I think from a customer standpoint, the concept of AI is very early days. As you know, our customer base is generally pretty conservative, pretty risk-averse. And I think they probably are more on a wait-and-see approach. Now we at Tyler are not – we’re not just sitting around taking a wait-and-see approach. We are actively looking at AI. We formed our own AI task committee. We’re actively already using a little bit of AI. We’re looking at things about how it can improv’ some of our internal efficiencies. We're lookin’ at things at how it can improve our competitiveness as well as how it can improve our clients’ efficiency. So we’re looking at that right now. But I would say, from a Tyler perspective, we’re pretty early on. And from a client’s perspective, they’re even earlier on.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Strauzer from CJS Securities, Inc.
Charles Strauzer: Just a quick question. Just it seems like every month or so, there's the high-profile data breach, the latest one being the MOVEit data breach, that has been in the news impacting government clients and private businesses. Have you seen any impact on your business from that? And more importantly, are you seeing opportunities from that as well?
Lynn Moore: Yes. I mean it’s an unfortunate reality of doing business is the world of cybersecurity and breaches. And our clients are not immune to it. I think there’s been a fair number of those over the last couple of years. My guess is for the ones that are publicized, there’s probably even more that are not. It does create opportunities for us. I think it creates opportunities to flip people into the cloud. It’s creating opportunities around, for example, our cybersecurity offering. We didn’t talk a lot about it last year. We had a client last year in Arizona that we had been trying to flip to the cloud for really for some time, and they had a security breach and that was the decision point for them to pull the trigger and flip to the cloud. So again, it’s an unfortunate part of doing business. But I think that also creates opportunities for our clients to move into more secure environments.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho from William Blair.
Jonathan Ho: Just wanted to maybe understand some of sort of your comments around seeing some additional out margin pressure around employee increases. Is this a change relative to your prior expectations? And can you maybe walk through some of the dynamics or the details around that?
Lynn Moore: Yes. It's really -- it's not around our labor costs generally or our headcount, it was really more around health care. We budget health care every year. We do the best we can. We model it based on last year's practices. And we've just been experiencing a higher level of employee claims this year than the budget. Last year, I think our employee claims were a little bit below budget. This year, they're trending higher. And we're just trying to grapple with that as we go forward. It's something that we're probably modeling to continue throughout the rest of the year. But there's ebbs and flows as it relates to health care.
Brian Miller: Yes. There continues to be higher inflation, I think on the health care side, even than in the environment in general, utilization is up, more high claims experience. So – we continue to monitor it. We believe we have adjusted our expectations for the balance of the year in our guidance. But it is – I would point out that it’s several million dollars of expense in the first half of the year above what our expectations were. And so I think that makes our – the performance we’ve turned in for the first half of the year, even more positive. But – and you see that throughout our margins, but also especially in the SG&A side.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Keith Housum from Northcoast Research.
Keith Housum: Brian, a question for you on your commentary regarding the Public Safety segment having the first -- the best first half of the year. Is there something in the market that's helping to contribute to that? Or is this a market share gain, but how do you guys explain, I guess, your success you're having there?
Lynn Moore: I'd say it's a couple of things, Keith. Market activity is really strong in public safety. We're seeing demos right now are on pace for their highest level in a year that we've seen in a long time. Proposals are up. Our competitive position is good. We've done some internal resets at public safety and really kind of excited about where we are. I mean we landed 3 really large deals this quarter sort of in the range of $1.8 million to $2 million range, which we haven't done in a while. So we're excited about what's going on in public safety. We're excited about where the market is and some of the things we've done internally to capture that market.
Brian Miller: Yes, the competitive position is -- continues to improve. We've made investments in that product over the last several years. And I think the integration with some of the other acquisitions we've made, like our enforcement mobile product, our data and analytics capabilities are very, very strong. And so all of those things that create a very strong integrated public safety platform along with the integration to our Courts & Justice platform, continue to improve our market position.
Lynn Moore: Yes. Our mobility platform, a big differentiator. And I think what’s also encouraging is that we talked about – I think Brian mentioned in his remarks earlier, is the fact that the public safety market is really starting to slowly – I’ll say slowly, but embrace movement to the cloud. It’s been sort of moving in a snails pace. I’m not suggesting it’s going crazy, but we are seeing a lot more receptiveness, which was highlighted by some of the deals we talked about earlier.
Operator: We have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Lynn Moore for any further remarks.
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Colby, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Brian Miller or myself. Have a good day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-04-27 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to today’s Tyler Technologies First Quarter 2023 Conference Call. Your host for today’s call is Lynn Moore, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, April 27, 2023. I would like to turn the call over to Hala Elsherbini, Tyler Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Hala Elsherbini: Thank you, Davin, and welcome to our call. With me today is Lynn Moore, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. After I give the Safe Harbor statement. Lynn will have some initial comments on our quarter, and then Brian will review the details of our results and provide our annual guidance. Lynn will end with some additional comments, and then we’ll take your questions. During this conference call, the management may make statements that provide information other than historical information and may include projections concerning the company’s future prospects, revenues, expenses, and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Also, in our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We have also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financials tab schedules with supplemental information, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues.  On the Events and Presentations tab, we posted an earnings summary slide deck to supplement our prepared remarks. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Lynn?
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Hala. We began 2023 by delivering strong first quarter results that met or exceeded our expectations for most key metrics. We continue to see broad-based demand across our product solutions, reflecting strength in the public sector market and our unique ability to support our public sector client’s digital modernization needs. We're seeing a high level of request for proposal and demo activity across our software business with particularly strong activity in the ERP space. Our mix of new software business also demonstrates how our market continues to embrace the move to the cloud. Total revenue growth was 3.5% with 7.2% organic growth, which also excludes COVID-related revenues and recurring revenues comprised nearly 84% of our quarterly revenues. We're pleased with our solid revenue growth even as the shift to SaaS and our new software mix continued to accelerate, with SaaS deals comprising 87% of our Q1 new software contract value compared to 80% last year. Most importantly, SaaS revenues grew organically at 24.4%. Our sales activity this quarter reflected strong cross-selling success including opportunities driven by leveraging state relationships at our Digital Solutions division, formerly NIC, and upsells with our data and insight solutions. In addition to our current quarter wins, our pipeline of cross-sell opportunities continues to grow. We also continue to execute our growth strategy around our payments business. During the first quarter, we signed more than 120 new payment deals, and we are especially pleased with the early traction that we are gaining with our acquisition of Rapid Financial Solutions and their robust payment issuing capabilities. I'd like to highlight a couple of first quarter deals that illustrate these successes. In Indiana, we expanded the relationship between Indiana's family and social services administration and our Digital Solutions division with a contract for Tyler's Disbursement as a Service platform to improve the payment disbursement process for sending its existing child care and development fund payments to providers. The purpose of the CCDS federal program is to increase the availability, affordability and quality of childcare. Leveraging the capabilities from the Rapid acquisition, in combination with our existing state enterprise contract, we will streamline the entire disbursement process from portal setup, including registering users and collecting banking information from providers to virtual account payments across all payment types and channels. Through Rapid's robust platform, the solution will also provide reporting and reconciliation features to support complete oversight of the payment program. In addition, we signed two payments contracts to provide rapid disbursement solution for court funds, including Fort Bend County, Texas, a current user of Tyler's jury management solution and Shelby County, Tennessee, a current Tyler Enterprise courts client. The quarter's largest SaaS deal valued at approximately $18.5 million was with the province of New Brunswick in Canada for our enterprise assessment solution. New Brunswick becomes the fourth Canadian province to implement our flagship property tax solution. Now I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our annual guidance for 2023.
Brian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2023. Total revenues for the quarter were $471.9 million, up 3.5%. Organic revenue growth, which also excludes COVID-related revenues was 7.2%. Last year's first quarter included $20.6 million of revenues from COVID-related initiatives, at our Digital Solutions division, formerly NIC, all of which ended in 2022. License revenue declined 39% as our new software contract mix continued to shift to SaaS at an accelerated pace. Professional services revenue declined 13% due to completion of COVID initiatives, but rose 4.7% organically. Subscriptions revenue increased 14.3% and organically rose 16.4%. Within subscriptions, our SaaS revenues grew 24.4% to $126.6 million and transaction revenues grew 7.1% to $153.9 million. On an organic basis, which also excludes COVID-related revenues, Transaction revenues grew 13.1%. We added 145 new SaaS arrangements and converted 73 existing on-premises clients to SaaS with a total new software contract value of approximately $86 million. In Q1 of last year, we added 149 new SaaS arrangements and had 88 on-premises conversions, with the total new software contract value of approximately $76 million. Our new SaaS bookings in the first quarter added $17.1 million in new ARR. Our total ARR was approximately -- I'm sorry, $1.58 billion, up 9.1% and organically grew 11.5%. Since Q4 of last year, SaaS revenues now exceed our maintenance revenues. Operating margins in the quarter were once again pressured by the acceleration of the shift to the cloud in the new business and the related decline in license revenues. As we've previously stated, we expect operating margin to trough in 2023 and to return to a trajectory of margin expansion in 2024. As we also discussed last quarter, merchant and interchange fees from our payments business under the gross revenue model have a meaningful impact on our overall margins. In Q1, we paid merchant fees of approximately $42 million. If those fees were netted out of both revenues and cost of revenues, our consolidated non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter would have been approximately 200 basis points higher. Cash flow was robust this quarter with cash flow from operations of $74.7 million, up 39.5% and free cash flow of $63.6 million up 55.1%. As a reminder, cash flow for the balance of the year will be impacted by an estimated $131 million of cash tax payments resulting from the Section 174 tax changes, of which $73 million is related to 2022 taxes and $58 million is related to 2023 estimated taxes. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet as we repaid $120 million of floating rate term debt during the first quarter. We ended Q1 with total outstanding debt of $875 million and cash and investments of approximately $174.2 million. Our net leverage at quarter end was approximately 1.52 times trailing 12-month pro forma EBITDA. Our revenue and non-GAAP earnings guidance for the year are unchanged. Our 2023 guidance is as follows: we expect total revenues will be between $1.935 billion and $1.970 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 8%.  We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be between $3.65 and $3.80 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock option activity on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $7.50 and $7.65. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $26 million including approximately $5 million of noncash amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release. I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn.
Lynn Moore : Thanks, Brian. Our first quarter results demonstrate the strong momentum we are building across our business. Our cloud transition initiatives are on track in this pivotal year as we make progress with our move from Tyler's data centers to AWS and managed through expected margin headwinds resulting from the accelerated pace of cloud adoption as well as cloud bubble costs. Our successes in the marketplace reflect our unparalleled competitive strength, synergistic cross-sell and upsell momentum and highly desirable cloud solutions and position us well to execute on our long-term strategic growth road map. In the next few days, we'll release our fourth annual corporate responsibility report. We hope you'll take some time to review it and learn more about the progress we've made with our ESG efforts. To close, we're extremely excited to host clients in person at Connect, our annual user conference, which will take place in San Antonio from May 7 through May 10. Registrations are an all-time high, and this will be our largest connect ever, with some 6,000 public sector clients attending.  We also look forward to our upcoming Investor Day that will be held in person on June 15 in Frisco, Texas, along with a live webcast. We look forward to highlighting our differentiated value proposition in our mid- to long-term strategic plan, growth drivers and financial targets supporting our Tyler 2030 vision. More details will be communicated soon, and we hope you'll be able to join us in person or online. With that, we'd like to open the line for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ryan [indiscernible] from Credit Suisse Securities USA. Your line is open.
Sami Badri: This is Sami Badri on Ryan's line. The first question I wanted to kick off with was just about operating margins. It looks like you guys did better than what Street and our models were forecasting. And I kind of just want to understand if the mechanism kind of going into the model or into the business, it's allowing you guys to execute a little bit better. Are you seeing better pricing, better cost control? Any other kind of details around the margin beat? And then the other question is, I know that you guys have been messaging about operating margins troughing in 2022 before they expand in 2024. But is it possible that we have already seen your operating margins trough and those are very well understood and you're going to be building and expanding from this point forward maybe from a 2Q base? Can you just give us color on margins, please?
Brian Miller: Sure. Around the second part of the question, I don't think we've seen the trough yet for the full year. We think the consolidated margin for the full year will be lower this year than it was last year, and our guidance implies that. I do think -- and I don't think Q2 will be the point where you'll see year-over-year margin improvement. I think by Q4, we'd expect that we would be seeing year-over-year margin improvement at that point. But not -- I don't think we've hit the trough yet. And then in terms of the overall margin, we don't give quarterly guidance, so we didn't have a quarterly margin target out there. Our earnings and revenue guidance is basically unchanged from where we started the year. So our expectations at this point are generally consistent. The first quarter did have good performance, good growth around the subscription revenues as some of those revenues are coming online from deals we've signed in prior quarters. And the pace at which those revenues hit can affect that somewhat. I think our subscription revenues were probably a bit above the -- where the Street was. But generally, our expectation for the full year margins hasn't changed.
Lynn Moore: Yes, Sami, I'd add this, too. We've talked a lot over the last couple of years about the cloud transition and the impact on both revenue headwinds and margins, but there's a lot more going on within Tyler. And I'd say right now, there's a lot of intentionality going on at Tyler. It's a little bit more than just sort of sitting back and letting the cloud transition run through the financial analysis. We have a lot of internal analysis, we have a lot of initiatives going on beyond just the cloud transition, taking a look -- deep look at different parts of our business, different things that we should be doing and can be doing. And I really commend our executive team and really our entire staff for the work that's going on right now. There's a lot of work going on at Tyler for sure. But I could say that everybody is sort of aligned generally with what our long-term goals and our long-term vision is and part of that is around margin expansion. So there's just a lot of things going on, a lot of intentionality. There are some bigger pieces. There's smaller things that we're doing. But I think there's just a lot of intentionality going on.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Kirk Materne: Thanks very much. Lynn, given that you're going to connect next week or next week or in the next couple of weeks, can you just talk about what you're hoping clients take away from that? And I was just kind of curious if you've seen more folks from, say, state governments signing up to participate at the conference?
Lynn Moore: Yes, Kirk, that's a good question. We actually are hosting some special events around our state government clients, and we're going to have a lot of our key state government stakeholders there. We're going to have them introduced to a lot of our executive team. So there'll be sort of a side path going on with them, also be part of the larger forum as well. Connect is just a unique opportunity for us. We've got so many clients. It's a chance for us to sit down and talk to them, talk about our vision, but also listen to them and listen to their needs, hear what their vision is, it's a chance for us to interact. It's a great opportunity for us to help our clients with more training, more information, talk about the new offerings that we have, things that can make their jobs better and more efficient. It's a big event. It takes a lot of work. Our marketing team does -- and events team just does -- it's an amazing job. If anybody hasn't been to it, I'd recommend people go, it's really done in a first-class manner. There's a lot of work that goes into it. It's not an inexpensive event, but it's something that's very worthwhile. I think not only does Tyler and executive team get a lot out of it. I think our clients get a lot out of it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew VanVliet from BTIG. Your line is open.
Matthew VanVliet: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, Lynn, on the back of the last question there, you referenced a number of potential pipeline opportunities around some of the state-level contracts. Curious if you could give us some sense of sort of the magnitude of how much you feel like is in sort of the near-term pipeline, where you're actually discussing specific deal terms and things of that nature? And maybe just compared to sort of how much upsell cross-sell has come through those contracts since the acquisition closed and I guess maybe it boils down to sort of what inning or what percentage of those potential opportunities do you think you've realized so far? What's on sort of the near term and then what's maybe more long term in terms of mix? Thanks.
Lynn Moore: Yes, sure, Matthew. I think we're -- part of your question, I think we're still in the early innings. I'd say we're still in the early innings with everything we're doing with NIC. Probably talked a year ago about being in the first inning. We might be in the top of the second. The cross-sell opportunities continue to grow. We take a very deliberate approach around that. We've been instituted this year.  We've been doing the strategic account management meetings where we're getting the Tyler salespeople together with state GMs and really sort of doing what we call sort of a state of the state baseline where we're sort of taking a deep dive and look into what are the objectives in that particular state, what are the relationships NIC, our Digital Solutions division brings, where what's the Tyler product footprint, what's the terms of the contract vehicle, how can we easily get products into those clients' hands. When we talk about what those near-term opportunities are, we do qualify them. I mean we have a number of opportunities that we think are more longer term, but what we call more qualified leads. We're up around sort of in the 175, 180 range right now. All different types of plays that we're looking at there, probably somewhere around $50 million ARR is what we've considered a more qualified pipe. Qualified pipe to me is not something that's going to close in the next month or 2, but it's something that I think has got a pretty viable horizon on it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Reilly of Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Joshua Reilly: Yes, thanks for taking my question. You mentioned the strong ERP results in the quarter and the pipeline for the rest of the year. Can you just speak to what's driving that pipeline and the visibility that you have in ERP deals for the rest of 2023? Thank you.
Lynn Moore: Yes. I think what I would say there, Josh, was that what we're seeing in terms of the sales indicators, the RFP volume, the number of demos that we're doing is really at almost all-time highs. Now that's not going to turn into business for several quarters, but it's very encouraging to see. I don't really -- I can't really put my finger on what's driving that right now other than the fact that demand remains high and our clients' budgets remain solid.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Terry Tillman of Truist Securities. Your line is open.
Terry Tillman: Yes, good morning, Lynn and Brian. And Hala thanks for taking my question. Question with a slight follow-up. I guess on the conversions, what I'd be curious, Lynn, has anything evolved or changed in terms of -- as you're doing these flips or conversions, the propensity to maybe do multi-suite then and/or just think much more strategic and broader with the broader product footprint that you've evolved? And then the second part of this is just with Rapid Financial Solutions. It sounds like it's really interesting in terms of kind of 1 plus 1 3. Anything on the quantifying the size of that business now?
Lynn Moore: Sure. I think we certainly use the flips and conversions as an opportunity to upsell. That is part of our strategic direction. We're still going at a pretty healthy pace. I think when we get to Investor Day in June, probably give us -- we'll probably hear a little more guidance on the pace of our conversions and where we think we'll be over the next 4, 5, 6, all the way up to Tyler 2030. But yes, you're exactly right. It's an opportunity for us to once again reach out and upsell other products around and then help incentivize flip to. As it relates to Rapid, this is a transaction that we're pretty excited about. It's a capability that we didn't have in-house. It's not a capability that I didn't have in house, the whole bringing in the whole issuing side of disbursements and the fact that we closed that deal at the end of November. And so we've owned this company for just a little over about 5 months now, not quite 5 months and already the synergies in working with the digital services team, formally NIC, these deals that we've already got signed, I think this early is something a little unusual for us with acquisitions. It normally takes a little bit of time. There's a lot of road map looking out on the disbursement side payments. As you know, they're primarily focused right now sort of in the justice space, but there's applicability across all of our product lines. That again is going to take years to develop, but it's pretty exciting, the early momentum we've seen.
Brian Miller: And we don't disclose the revenues for Rapid separately, but when we acquired them, they were in the kind of $14 million, $15 million annual revenue range.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] from Wolfe Research. Your line is open
Unidentified Analyst : Hey, Guys, this is Alex. So I guess maybe just a quick question -- another quick question on the demand environment. It does seem, Lynn, that you're seeing literally every company kind of talk about the strength of state and local. Is there -- obviously, the budgets have been on a relative basis, better than other sectors, but is there anything unique or special going on? And kind of if you look at your own pace of new SaaS bookings, has that changed at all? Like is it -- is the environment better on a relative basis than where you thought it was going to be? Is it as good as you thought it was going to be? I'd love to get color there. And then just one for Brian around. I appreciate the commentary on operating margin trends through the year. Is there anything you can help us with on free cash flow specifically, I think the $130 million, how that propagates those cash tax payments through the year. And as you're looking at cash conversion on an annual basis, where that falls out?
Lynn Moore: Yes. I think when we talk about what we're seeing in the market, it's a couple of things, probably. I mean we're -- it certainly reinforces the principle that the things that we're providing are essential functionality. I think it reinforces the principle that we went through some periods of time where there might have been a little pent up demand coming out of COVID and also the continued shift towards modernization and digitization of local government. We also see where we talk about the labor markets, for example, and how the labor markets are affecting different companies, but they're also affecting our clients. And as there's labor shortages and turnovers with our clients, it's also creating challenges for our clients, which is having them really point to and use technology to help bridge that gap. So there's just a lot of things going on right now. It's a good market right now. And it's -- I don't know how I'd characterize this to my expectation, but I'm pretty happy with where the market is right now.
Brian Miller: And on the free cash flow and I think a little bit on the bookings growth that Lynn was just mentioning. It's interesting our overall bookings growth was on an organic basis around 7%. But our subscription bookings on an organic basis were almost 24%, very close to the same number our revenue growth was. So the real strength is in the bookings, both the SaaS and the transaction bookings. On the free cash flow, yes, the $130 million, $131 million estimated incremental cash taxes this year related to Section 174 is a bit higher than we had talked about in the fourth quarter call as we've got more information and gotten into the calculations more. That impact is a little bit higher this year. I think it's $73 million of that applies to really the deposit for last year's taxes about $58 million this year. So that impact does continue to decline each year, but we have a 2-year impact or catch up in this year, but that impact should decline year-over-year until after five years, it sort of neutral. We made -- the biggest piece of that in mid-April. I think it was around $85 million. And then I think the impact is around, I think, in the $15 million range in the -- it's roughly equal in each of the last 3 quarters. On a free cash flow basis, overall, I think our free cash flow margin, excluding the Section 174 impact is, I'd say, the ranges in the kind of 18% to 20% margin range. And including the impact of the free cash flow -- I'm sorry, more in the mid-teens range and including the impact of the Section 174 change, it's kind of high single, low double-digit free cash flow margin. So the impact is pretty meaningful this year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays. Your line is open.
Saket Kalia: Okay. Great. Good morning, Lynn, good morning Brian, thanks for taking my question here. Brian maybe for you. I appreciate the additional disclosure, I think, on SaaS bookings ARR. I think that was what we called in the supplement. And I think that grew mid-single digits this quarter off of a very tough compare. I was just wondering if you could just talk a little bit about how that sort of trend -- how you sort of think about that trending through the year? And maybe just introduce us to that metric a little bit. And then just relatedly, on disclosure, can you just talk about some of the other changes here? Like I think appraisal is a metric that we used to get before. I think that's gotten consolidated somewhere else. Just talk to us a little bit about some of the disclosure changes here and what you want us to focus on in terms of the new?
Brian Miller: Yes. Appraisal is certainly a much smaller piece of our business. Appraisal Services, it's an important service that we provide often to customers that we also have sold or will sell a property tax system to. But it's now well under 2% of our revenues. And so we've consolidated that line into the professional services line. And again, the focus, as you've seen from some of the things we've talked about really is around subscriptions revenue growth, the recurring revenues. And we've given some detail breaking that out between the SaaS revenues and the transaction-based revenues, which would be things like payments, our digital solutions portal, e-filing those sorts of things. In the SaaS bookings detail, you're correct, it grew sort of mid-single digits. But the -- that's really just referring to basically new logo SaaS deals. So there's additional SaaS bookings in the upsells, pricing increases, inside sales of additional products to existing customers. So the metric we really think is important is the bookings growth number for subscriptions overall, which are the transactions and SaaS revenues, and that was 23.6% this quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Pete Heckmann of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.
Peter Heckmann: Thank you. Good morning. Just a couple of quick questions. You've done a fabulous job of reducing net leverage post the acquisition of NIC. How are you thinking about the potential for M&A? How does that landscape look as well as valuations? And then really have focused mainly on deleveraging and not so much on the share repurchase plan. I mean what are your thoughts there in terms of resuming share repurchase at some level of net leverage?
Lynn Moore: Yes, sure, Pete. I think you're right. Our focus still continues to be a reduction of debt. We're -- that's our primary focus with our use of capital. It's interesting. Our term debt now is getting closer to 30% of our overall debt. It started off more at 65%. So we're about -- we've kind of flipped that model. We still look at M&A. We still evaluate a lot of M&A opportunities. Clearly, we just did this Rapid Solutions deal last fall. If we see an opportunity like that, where we really believe in the long-term strategic value, we're going to pursue it. I think that's been our take really even when we had a lot higher net leverage profile. That being said, we've got a lot of initiatives going on at Tyler, and we've got a lot of our hands full with a lot of different things. And I could see us continuing to do acquisitions like Rapid, but in terms of a larger sort of more transformational or entering into a whole new space, that's probably not on the near-term horizon.
Operator: Question comes from the line of Charles Strauzer of CJS Securities, Inc. Your line is open.
Charles Strauzer: Hi, good morning. Brian, on the last call, you talked about Q1 being similar to Q4 in terms of the EPS, a big ramp in Q2 with the full year guidance essentially unchanged. Should we assume that the ramp in Q2 will be less given that Q1 results were better than expected?
Brian Miller: Well, I think we'd still be in the same range for the full year. I'd say we're increasingly confident of that range, and we may be trending a little bit more to the upper end of the range at this point, although it's still early in the year. But I think that yes, maybe the ramp is -- I mean I think we were still in the ballpark. We did $1.66. Last year, we did $1.76 in the first quarter, but I think that jump up into Q2 and Q3 and Q4 would be maybe a little less pronounced, but again, we're in the -- pretty much in the same range.
Operator: Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
Michael Turrin: Thanks, good morning. Appreciate you taking the question. The commentary around the demand environment, RFP volume has remained consistently upbeat. I realize there are some moving pieces, but the organic growth number 7% towards the lower end of the target range. So can you just help us square those things? What is the organic growth number not entirely reflecting relative to the demand backdrop, whether it's pipeline bookings or just general mix and transition impacts? Any context you can provide just around your view on that number is helpful.
Brian Miller: I'll take a stab at that. I think most of it is around the lag between the time that we sign a new deal and when revenues start to hit the income statement. So when we've talked about our SaaS bookings over recent quarters and this quarter, in particular, being very strong. But there's typically a lag, whether it's a new software deal where it might be a quarter to 2 quarters maybe a little bit longer lags from the time we signed the contract to when the client is -- the environment is set up and we're able to start recognizing revenues and really the same sort of things in many of our transaction-based revenue contracts. We signed a new deal for payments, for example, and there might be perhaps a quarter or so lag between the time those revenues start to get recognized. At the same time, we see the impact of lower licenses immediately because if those were license deals, we would have recognized all that revenue or the majority of that revenue pretty much upfront when very soon after the contract is signed. So that would be the biggest factor there. And it's the same thing with flips from on-prem to the cloud. There's -- we may sign it now, but there's a period of time where that transition takes place, so we don't get the uplift in the revenues immediately.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Jonathan Ho from William Blair & Company. Your line is open.
Jonathan Ho: Hi, good morning. Can you talk a little bit about the data insights opportunity that you referenced in the script? And perhaps what kind of upsell opportunities you're seeing in and around that product grouping? Thank you.
Lynn Moore: Yes, Jonathan. I think I mean data insights is something that -- when I look out in the future of public sector, that's to me is an offering that I can see every single public sector agency needing. It's a very unique offering. We're in a unique position given our big -- our large footprint and our ability to surface data across so many different solutions, not only our own but even non-Tyler solutions. I think it's something that -- look, we made that investment now 5, 6 years ago. And I think we're starting to see more and more demand for it. What we've also seen is internally, we've actually sort of deconstructed the D&I former division within Tyler, and we now sort of have it integrated with each of our divisions so that we're aligning more product with the individual demand, so it's something that I think is a differentiator for us. I think it's always been a differentiator for us. We've seen it even in the last year or so, it's been a differentiator for NIC.  When we talk about a year ago, we were talking about the South Carolina rebid or the early renewal of the Texas payments contract. Those were done in part or primarily or a major factor was our data insights. So it's something that we're going to continue to leverage. I think we're in a unique position with it, and it's something that the public sector really needs.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Oliver of Baird. Your line is open.
Rob Oliver: Great. Brian, one for you. I know last quarter, it seemed like a couple of big deals that slipped out of the quarter and the deal sizing, I think, a bit more moderate. And just curious if you saw some of those deals closed this quarter and what you're seeing in terms of deal sizing. And then just a quick follow-up. So just on the free cash flow, just to understand that better. Is that is the impact there all of the catch-up from '22? Or is there anything else on the tax side that's impacting free cash flow? I apologize laryngitis here.
Brian Miller: Yes. On the free cash flow, yes, that impact is really pretty much all from the catch-up of Section 174, and it's a complicated calculation that's still evolving the overhead you have to add into it and some of those things. But the impact is higher than we initially expected, particularly related to the 2022 amount. Yes, the average deal size this quarter was a bit bigger than the average deal size in the first quarter of last year. A couple of those -- half of those deals that we referred to. And we always have deals that slipped from quarter-to-quarter with the subscription model, it's less impactful. But we did have a couple of license deals that we talked about in Q4 that we referred to, not by name that did close this quarter.  We had 2 really nice license deals with the -- for our property or recording product with 2 large counties in North Carolina, Wake County and which is Raleigh and Mecklenburg County, which is Charlotte. And then we had a nice public safety deal with the Virginia State Police that closed this quarter as well. So generally, we've seen those deals that the timing shifted a bit. We've seen those come in.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Gabriela Borges: Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to follow up on some of the commentary on margin expansion. So Lynn and Brian, as you think about the longer-term trajectory for margins, I know you've given us some qualitative color and a little bit of quantitative color as well. Is your expectation that margin progression after this year is likely to be linear? Or do you see a period of time when maybe there's an accelerated structure for margins?
Lynn Moore: Yes, Gabriela, I don't expect it will be linear. And certainly, margins and our targets and broadly how we view the trajectory of 1 of the topics we'll be looking to address at the Investor Day, that things are rarely linear. I do think around the timing of flips over the next few years as we accelerate the move of our clients from on-prem to the cloud, the timing of -- if that's a J-curve or an S curve or how that works will be a factor in that margin trajectory. I think that we're more certain around the timing of the closing of our data centers and we've talked about that in 2024 and towards the end of 2025, closing those 2 data centers and being able to reduce those bubble costs and so those will have more of an impact in those years. So I don't expect it to be linear. I really can't give much color beyond that right now, but it is something we'll continue to refine our outlook for and we'll be talking about margins will certainly be a significant topic at Investor Day.
Brian Miller: Yes. And of course, as we grow out through Tyler 2030 and we talk about our growth in our SaaS and our flips but at the same time, we're actively growing our transaction business and our payments business, which will have somewhat of a negative effect. So depending on the growth rates between those two businesses will have some impact on overall margins?
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Your line is open.
Keith Housum: Good morning, guys. Brian, I know quarters pass, you talked about the servicing revenue and the staffing up with that unit. Can you perhaps talk about the staffing really you're currently at, you’re? And if you have those people now, they're actually able to contribute to the bottom line?
Brian Miller: Yes. I think we've continued to hire new staff as well as are seeing attrition flow, which is not surprising, given some of the shifts in the broader employment markets. So as we've talked about over the last few quarters, we've added new people, new classes on the pro services side and those people are becoming billable. I think you'll see in Q2 and beyond, you'll see more of the impact of that, so we will likely see nice growth in services revenue, which will also help lead most importantly, bringing subscription revenues or SaaS revenues online at a faster pace. So I think you'll start to see that really the impact of those people becoming fully billable in Q2. And I think we're pretty well on plan with our efforts to step up to the capacity we want to have.
Lynn Moore: Yes. And I think to be clear, we've talked historically over the years about services and our margins on services. And services historically is not accretive to margins. We've talked in the past about it maybe in breakeven or really more of a loss leader. That's likely not to change going forward. I think when I talked earlier about intentionality around other things that we're doing within the business, part of that is things around what we can do to minimize the negative impact of services on overall margins.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Clarke Jeffries of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Clarke Jeffries: Brian, I just wanted to ask, was there a restatement of SaaS revenue in 2022? As I just look to Q4 as an example, it seems like we were talking about $110 million last quarter, and now it's $120 million in the supplementals. Was there any change here?
Brian Miller: There's not a -- there was a very small reclass, I think, of some revenues from transaction revenues to SaaS revenues. So getting those kind of in line with our current reporting, but not a significant one, but -- and that's reflected in the supplemental data.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Goodwin of JMP. Your line is open.
Joe Goodwin: I guess, Lynn and Brian, how different at the product or technology level would you say the current payment portfolio is so NIC, Rapid, everything you have there now that is built for governments versus other players in the space? And would you say you differentiate beyond your existing relationships and market presence? Or is there some differentiation on the technology level as well?
Brian Miller: Yes. We believe the technology is meaningfully differentiated from the more horizontal payment providers. So the -- whether it's the different types of payment channels we can offer now really robust disbursement capabilities adding to the payment acquiring side and then really around the reporting, the integration to Tyler's back-end systems that makes reconciliations easier that makes the client's job easier, and it's a meaningful differentiator for us. And in fact, it enables us, in many instances, to be -- to have really solid pricing and in some cases, premium pricing because we provide additional value around that. So Rapid was a nice addition to those capabilities, but NIC already had very, very robust capabilities and continues to invest in that payments platform and enhance those. And today, we have a lot of processes underway to further integrate that payment platform into the Tyler back-end systems to create more and more of a competitive edge because of that integration.
Lynn Moore: Yes. And Joe, I think you can expect at the Investor Day in June, for us to provide a little more color, maybe in a little more detail around some of these topics, specifically the topic around differentiation in the market and what we -- why we're different and the opportunities that we have in front of us.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Kirk Materne: Just a follow-up, Lynn, your comment on sort of payments and maybe, I guess, I'll drag Brian into this as well. Just on the gross revenue recognition, A, I assume you all have no real ability to pick which 1 you want to go with, meaning I assume that would be easier, but I assume grosses are required by accounting rules. And is there a certain scale that payments gets to that were the drag from a mix shift perspective becomes less, meaning probably I appreciate you calling out the 100 bps this quarter. Should we expect that to get incrementally better as it just grows in scale? So I was just kind of curious about if there's any flexibility to maybe get to that and then sort of how we should think about sort of the drag as that part of the business gets bigger? Thanks.
Brian Miller: There's not really a lot of ability to pick and choose how it's accounted for. And the difference is really whether we assume the responsibility and the risk for paying those merchant fees and interchange fees, which can vary depending on the type of credit card, whether it's Amex or Visa, whether it's a business card or a personal card. And so in most cases, our clients prefer for us to handle that so that they know what their fee is. So we have a percentage of the transaction that we charge, let's call it, 2%, and we pay out the merchant fees and interchange fees, and those might be, say, 1.75% but they can vary around that number. And generally, we also get a per transaction charge as well. And so we do get a margin on the merchant fees, but it's a pretty slim margin and then we also get a transaction fee generally. In a net model, we would -- the customer has chosen to pay those merchant fees interchange fees directly. And we're just getting a -- generally a per transaction charge for the services that we provide. And in most cases, the client prefers for us to take that risk. But if we are paying those fees, then we have to do gross accounting.  So we think it's important, even though there is some margin on those that we sort of put it back to give you what that impact is on a net basis. So if you take those fees out, as we talked about, if you take those out of both revenues and expenses and just sort of leave what we keep, it would -- it's a 200 basis point overall operating margin impact on Tyler as a whole. So depending on how fast those grow relative to the rest of Tyler, that impact could be bigger or could be smaller. And that's one of the reasons why we would expect to continue to sort of give you those numbers so that you can see the impact of and how that might be trending over time.
Lynn Moore: Yes. And just to be clear, Kirk, the -- it is customer driven, as Brian said, in the gross model, while lower margin actually produces higher free cash flow. So it's a benefit to our free cash flow.
Operator: And that was the last we have for today. So, I’d like to hand back to Lynn Moore, for closing comments. 
Lynn Moore: Thanks Kevin, and thanks everybody for joining us today. If you have any further questions please feel free contract Brian Miller, or myself. Have a great day.
Operator: That does conclude our conference today. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-16 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to today’s Tyler Technologies Fourth Quarter 2022 Conference Call. Your host for today’s call is Lynn Moore, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, February 16, 2023. I would like to turn the call over to Hala Elsherbini, Tyler Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Hala Elsherbini: Thank you, Emma, and welcome to our call. With me today is Lynn Moore, our President & Chief Executive Officer and Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. After I give the Safe Harbor statement. Lynn will have some initial comments on our quarter, and then Brian will review the details of our results and provide our annual guidance. Lynn will end with some additional comments, and then we’ll take your questions. During this call, the management may make statements that provide information other than historical information and may include projections concerning the company’s future prospects, revenues, expenses, and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Also in our earnings release we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe will facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures if provided in our earnings. We have also posted in our investor relations selection of our website under the financials tab with supplemental information provided on this call including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. On the events and presentations tab we posted an earnings summary slide deck to supplement our prepared remarks. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Lynn?
Lynn Moore: Thanks,s Hala. Our fourth quarter results marked a solid finish to an eventful year as public sector demand remained strong and SaaS adaption continues at an accelerated pace. Total revenues grew 4.3%, with organic growth excluding COVID related revenues of approximately 6% and organic revenue growth for full year was solid at approximately 8.2%. Recurring revenues comprised nearly 83% of our quarterly revenues. On an organic basis, subscription revenue grew 14.3%, reflecting both our accelerating shift to the cloud and growth and transaction-based revenues. Most importantly, SaaS revenues included in subscriptions grew 19.3%. We achieved solid revenue growth even as the shift in new software contract mix continue to accelerate to SaaS from licenses. In Q4, 86%, of our new software contract value was SaaS compared to 77% in Q4 last year. In our digital solutions division, which is formerly known as NIC, we continue to execute on cross-selling opportunities. And in Q4, we signed a significant new contract with the Kansas Department of Revenue to provide our Data and Insights Assessment Connect Solution, which will work with our Enterprise Assessment solution used statewide in Kansas. We also signed sell-through deals for our recreation dynamic solution with Utah division of outdoor recreation and the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and parks. Our Digital Solutions division also signed notable SaaS software agreements with the state of Nevada and the Alabama Alcohol Beverage Control Board. We also signed a payments processing contract with the Wisconsin Department of Motor Vehicles, which is our first payments opportunity in Wisconsin. Finally, our Digital Solutions division won a competitive rebid for our master enterprise contract with the state of Colorado’s Statewide Internet Portal Authority Board, as well as an extension of our master enterprise contract with the state of Oklahoma. In other Tyler divisions, we signed seven additional significant SaaS deals, each for different product suites and each with a total contract value greater than $2 million. Those include contracts with the Cypress Fairbanks Independent School District in Texas for our student transportation solution; the cities of Prosper Texas and Glendora, California for our enterprise ERP and enterprise permitting and licensing solutions; the Placer County Water Agency in California, and the City of Helena, Montana for our enterprise ERP solution; the City of Albuquerque, New Mexico for enterprise permitting licensing solution; and Lucas County, Ohio for our enterprise justice solution. In addition to those deals, we signed 12 SaaS deals in the quarter, with contract values between $1 million and $2 million each. In the fourth quarter, we signed 153 new payments deals worth more than $4.7 million in estimated annual recurring revenue across Tyler divisions, other than digital solutions. The largest of those was an agreement to provide payment processing for the City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, was estimated annual revenues of more than $1.2 million. For the full year 2022, we signed 571 new payments deals, with more than $13 million in annual recurring revenue, many of which we were able to pursue because of the new capabilities that came to us with NIC. More than 80% of those were sold to existing Tyler software clients. New payments only agreements typically have a lag of three to six months between signing and revenue generation. While payments agreements that are embedded in a broader solution, such as new ERP sale, may have a period of 6 to 18 months from signing to revenue generation.  In our justice group, we signed two notable multi suite license deals in the quarter for enterprise public safety, enforcement mobile and data insight solutions with Stearns County, Minnesota and Richland County, Ohio. We also signed two significant license contracts for our Enterprise Justice Solution with Midland County, Texas and Kankakee County, Illinois, which also include our Enterprise Solution - Supervision solution. Now, I’d like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our annual guidance for ‘23.
Brian Miller: Thank you, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022. Both GAAP and non-GAAP revenues for the quarter were $452.2 million, up 4.3% and 4.2%, respectively. Organic revenue growth, excluding COVID-related revenues, with 6% on a GAAP basis and 5.8% on a non-GAAP basis. COVID-related revenues for the quarter were $3.5 million compared to $16.6 million in last year’s fourth quarter. Revenues from all of our COVID-related initiatives have now officially ended. Licensed revenue declined over 60% as our new software contract mix continued to shift to SaaS at an accelerated pace. Professional services revenue rose 2.8% and 8.5% organically. And we intend to continue to grow our implementation teams in 2023 to support delivery of our growing backlog and pipeline that will likely continue to see some pressure on professional services revenue in the near-term as the teams ramp up to become fully billable. Subscriptions revenues increased 11.9% and organically rose 14.3%. We added 140 new SaaS arrangements and converted 82 existing on-premises clients to SaaS, with a total contract value of approximately $99 million. In Q4 of last year, we added 135 new SaaS arrangements and had 71 on-premises conversions, with the total contract value of approximately $74 million. Our software subscription bookings in the fourth quarter added $21.4 million in new ARR. Subscription contract value comprised approximately 86% of the total new software contract value signed this quarter, compared to 77% in Q4 of last year. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this year, this quarter was 3.9 years consistent with last year. Transaction-based revenues, which includes state enterprise portal, payment processing and E-filing revenues and are included in subscriptions, were $146.5 million, up 6.9%. E-filing revenue reached a new high of $19.8 million, up 12.7%. Our non-GAAP ARR was approximately $150 billion - I’m sorry, $1.50 billion, up 7.5%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS software arrangements was $440.6 million, up 18.5%. Transaction-based ARR was $586.2 million, up to 6.9% and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was slightly down at $469.1 million due to the continued shift of new clients and migration of on-premises clients to the cloud. Operating margins in the quarter were pressured by the acceleration of the shift to the cloud in new business and the related decline in license revenues as well as by an increase in R&D expense as certain development costs that we had expected to capitalize were expensed. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was a new high of $1.89 billion, up 5.2%. Bookings in the quarter were approximately $464 million, which was flat with last year. On an organic basis bookings were approximately 354 million up 2%. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately 1.9 billion, up 9.5% and on our organic basis were approximately 1.4 billion up 1.6%. Capital expenditures for the year totaled $50.1 million below our Q3 guidance of $58 million to $62 million, primarily because of the reduction and capitalized software development that drove higher R&D expense. Cash flows from operations were 121.9 million up 6% and free cash flow was 114.7 million up 20.6%; both represented a new high for the fourth quarter.  We continue to strengthen our already solid balance sheet throughout 2022. During the fourth quarter, we repaid $90 million of our term debt and since completing the NIC acquisition, we have paid down $755 million of debt. We ended the year with outstanding debt of 995 million and cash and investments of approximately 229 million. As a reminder $600 million of our debt is in the form of convertible debt with a fixed interest rate of a quarter of a percent. The remaining $395 million in pre-payable term debt due in 2024 and 2026 with interest in flooding rates based on LIBOR plus a margin of 125 or 150 basis points. Thus our exposure to floating rates is limited. Beginning in February 2023 SOFR has replaced LIBOR as our reference rate. We also have an undrawn $500 million revolver. Our net leverage at quarter end was approximately 1.64 times trailing 12 months pro EBITDA. We’ve also issued our initial guidance for 2023. Please keep in mind that our outlook for 2023 includes no COVID related revenues as those initiatives were completed in the fourth quarter. For the year 2022 COVID related revenues totaled $51 million with $10.8 million in subscriptions, and 40.2 million in professional services. In addition, another revenue headwind that is factored into our guidance is the shift of two of our digital solutions state enterprise agreements from the gross to the net model for payments resulting in a 10.5% million reduction in revenues, although with a positive impact on margins. Our 2023 guidance is as follows. We expect both GAAP and non-GAAP total revenues will be between $1.935 billion and $1.970 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 8%. To add more color to our revenue expectations, we expect growth by revenue line to be in the following approximate ranges. Subscription revenues will grow in the mid teens. Professional services revenues will decline in the high single digits but excluding COVID revenues will grow in the high single digits. License and royalty revenues will decline approximately 30% or more. Maintenance will decline in the low single digits. Appraisal services will grow in the high single digits and hardware and other revenue will be relatively flat. We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be between $4.10 and $4.25 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock option activity on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $7.50 and $7.65. Well, we don’t give quarterly guidance, we do expect first quarter EPS to be in the range of Q4, 2022 EPS with a significant sequential increase in Q2. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $26 million including approximately $5 million of non-cash amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release. And finally, while we don’t give specifically guidance on free cash flow, we want to point out a change in taxes that we expect will have a significant impact on our cash taxes and therefore our free cash flow. The tax cut and jobs act required that starting in 2022 research and experimentation expenditures known as Section 174 costs are required to be capitalized and amortized over either five years for expenditures in the U.S. or 15 years for those incurred outside the U.S. for tax purposes. Since the enactment of the TCJA businesses, including us have been monitoring congressional actions around this rule, and there was a strong expectation that section 174 would be repealed or delayed. However, Congress has not yet taken action. While the section 174 change has a slight favorable impact on our tax rate it significantly accelerates the timing and amount of our cash tax payments. Now I’d like to turn the call back over to Lynn.
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. During 2022, we achieved notable milestones towards several key strategic initiatives. We made meaningful progress on our cloud journey through continued investment in cloud optimization, and moving to cloud only deployment for many of our core solutions. Our intentional innovation is based on knowing our clients and anticipating their future knees. As you recall, in 2019, we launched a strategic shift from a cloud agnostic model to a cloud first model to deliver secure, scalable, dependable and compliant digital infrastructure. We’re pleased to see the accelerated pace of cloud adoption amongst our new clients, as well as the steady increasing pace of cloud migrations of on-premises clients. Additionally, we integrated our Tyler and NIC payments teams and launched a significant go to market strategy for payments with a growing and active pipeline. During the year, we added 571 new payments clients with the vast majority at the local level. We leveraged our strong relationships across state and local agencies, including the NIC state enterprise contracts, to expand our cross sell opportunities with significant multi solution deals that demonstrate the power of our One Tyler approach. We’re still in the early stages of cross sell, and it’s exciting to see tremendous momentum and collaboration taking place. Since completing the acquisition of NIC synergies between NIC and Tyler have delivered 19 cross sell transactions worth $9.5 million in total contract value.  Overall, the year was highlighted by significant wins highly successful upsell efforts and state renewals and expansions. Throughout the year, we also demonstrate a balanced yet opportunistic approach across our business and with respect to capital allocation. We maintain a strategic lens toward acquisitions and close three transactions that bring innovative and robust offerings to elevate our digital solutions payments business, broaden our integrated solutions, and add new technology. All three acquisitions Quadrate, USC Direct and Rapid Financial Solutions support a unified client experience and further our connected communities vision to support thriving communities through a common digital foundation for better data access, engagement, and transparency. As we move into 2023, I’ve never been more confident about Tyler’s long term prospects. This is an important year in our cloud transition. And we are tracking well with our cloud optimization product development efforts and the plan to exit from our proprietary data centers in 2024 and 2025. We expect to reach an inflection point in our cloud transition in 2023 with a significant decline in licensed revenues that are being replaced by valuable long term recurring SaaS revenue. As a result of the short term revenue headwinds from this mix shift, together with bubble costs related to SaaS transition, including duplicate costs of operating our proprietary data centers, while moving our hosting to AWS operating margins are expected to trough this year. The estimated impact of bubble costs on our 2023 non-GAAP operating margin is approximately 130 basis points. We are committed to returning to a trajectory of consistent operating margin expansion beginning in 2024. In fact, you’ll see in our upcoming proxy statement that we have added operating margin expansion as a second metric for our long term incentive plans for our senior leadership.  Our move to cloud first builds long term value and supports multiple long term growth drivers. In the midterm over the next five to seven years, we’ve talked about annual organic revenue growth in the 8% to 10% range, with consistent long term margin expansion of at least 50 to 100 basis points a year beginning in 2024 excluding the impact of merchant PCs from payments expansion. We continue to refine our Tyler 2030 plan and look forward to sharing our longer term vision and clearly defined targets for revenue, margin and payments growth during an investor day planned for mid year. Look for more details on that soon. When we look at our operating margins, it’s also important to consider the impact that growth in our payments business has on margins. We recognize revenues for payment processing under multiple revenue models. A gross model for agreements, where we are responsible for merchant fees on the transactions, a net model where a client assumes direct responsibility for merchant fees, and a revenue sharing model similar to the net model where we are effectively reselling a third party processor services. The majority of NIC’s payment processing is under the gross model. And in 2022, we paid a total merchant fees of approximately $145 million with a small margin earned on those fees. If those same contracts were on a net basis, our consolidated non-GAAP operating margin would have been approximately 200 basis points higher. Our operational and financial discipline coupled with a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity allow us to aggressively manage our debt profile and moderate the impact of rising interest rates. And delevering continues to be a priority for capital allocation. While the bar is high for acquisitions, we continue to have the flexibility to evaluate M&A prospects that present compelling strategic growth opportunities. To close I’m proud of our team Tyler team and what we continue to accomplish every day even amid macro economic uncertainty. As you’ve seen in our press releases, we received many industry and regional accolades, which is a testament to our work ethic, our culture, and our tireless efforts to support our clients’ needs. We also receive gratifying recognition for our environmental, social and governance practices, being named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America for the second consecutive year. The DJSI cited are notable gains in IT security, risk analysis, privacy protection, and human capital development. In addition, we were recently named to Newsweek’s list of America’s greatest workplaces for diversity. We’re proud of these recognitions, and remain committed to sustainable business practices. With that, we’d like to open up the line for Q&A. 
Operator: We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. 
Sami Badri: Hi, thank you very much. And I had a question about the margin troughing in ‘23 and maybe you could just give us color on the ramp on from the bottom of ‘23 what should we be thinking about where margins could go in ‘24? And I think the big thing here is maybe you could give us color on like, what are some reasons why the bounce off the trough could be faster versus slower? And what are some things that could influence the speed of the margin movements?
Brian Miller: Yes. I think it’s still a little early for us to give much color around sort of how we see that trajectory playing out in 2024 and over the midterms over the next five to seven years. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we expect to have an Investor Day around mid-year and provide more detail on that, but we’re still refining those models. So not really able to give a lot of color around that. As we’ve talked about some of the factors that give us confidence that we do return to margin expansion in 2024, particularly around the wind down of some of the bubble costs as we exit our first data center. We think that this year, actually, we sort of reached that inflection point where the impact of declines in licenses are offset by the current stream of recurring revenues from subscriptions. I think in terms of the factors that could make that go faster or slower certainly one of those is the speed at which our payments business grows. And Lynn talked a little bit about the impact that has on our blended margins. But on the software side, I think that the trajectory around the speed of the flips from our on-premise customers will have an impact on that. Some of the other efficiency gains and product optimizations as we wrap those up the ability to improve lower hosting costs, I think the speed at which those work their way into the model will also be a factor in how that trajectory, how fast that trajectory plays out. 
Lynn Moore: Yes, I think just to amplify on that we’ve talked over the last couple of years we’re about three or four years or so into this cloud transition. And we’ve talked about sort of the two pieces of it, the getting dealer side on the revenue side, and then sort of getting the other side on the cost and expense side. And as Brian mentioned, on the revenue side, we’re seeing that sort of inflection point it’s going to take place, probably later this year. And last couple of years, the last licenses has been a significant impact. And our internal models are now showing that really the new flips, the gains from flip as well as the SaaS business over the last couple of years, is going to later this year, sort of past that point of where we lost licenses. Remember, back in 2019, we did just over $100 million in licenses. So it’s a significant change that we’ve been running through the financials. And then when you look on the cost side each years go by, as these, as time goes by, we’re getting better and better visibility where we are making progress on optimizing our products. We’re making more progress on our plans to exit our proprietary data centers. We’re getting better data on how our products are actually operating within the public cloud. And so a lot of that stuff gives us that confidence that 2023 is that margin trough. As we look out farther there’s other things that we’re doing as well. We have a lot of internal initiatives around efficiencies, things like consolidating just some of our internal IT. We have other sort of satellite data centers that we’re looking to collapse, as well as things like looking at real estate and stuff like that. So there’s a lot of initiatives around that, which I think give us that confidence when we talk about ‘23 being sort of the margin trough.
Sami Badri: Got it. Thank you for that color. I want to shift gears a little bit and just talk about your end market, your customers, the funding flywheel. We’ve clearly started to see some companies that are indexed to federal state and municipal budgets start to see the benefit of funds flowing in. They could be coming in from ARPA, some of them are still coming in from the Cares Act. And just in general, state and local budgets are up or up a lot, I guess, in 2022, fiscal 2022, and look like they’re going to be up low-single digits in fiscal year ‘23 which means like the base level of state and local budgets are just much higher than what we’ve really seen before. Have you been able to identify some of those incremental lifts in those budget allocations or federal funds start to come into the business in the form of contracted revenue or bookings? 
Lynn Moore: I think the answer is probably similar to what we’ve said in the past. I would say, as I look at our clients budgets, they’re generally very healthy. As I’ve mentioned, before, they were not as impacted by COVID, as people thought. They are having access to federal funds. Some of it, Brian, the timetables of one that they still have a couple of years, I think it’s been there. So we’re just generally seeing healthy budgets, healthy buying seasons, sort of just a really good, robust market. In terms of identifying specific deals there are occasions for that. But I think really, what it does is it’s more about just overall confidence in our clients being willing to spend money. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Oliver with Baird. Your line is now open. 
Rob Oliver: Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning, Lynn, one for you. You mentioned the milestones on the cloud side since 2019 when you pivoted to the cloud-first approach and certainly, seems like those are paying off, particularly with new business around subscription definitely felt that among your customers in Indianapolis last year talking to them about their readiness for cloud. But I wanted to ask a little bit about you talked about new flips. How should we think about the pace of conversions? This is clearly going to be an important driver here. They are up modestly from last year, nothing to really write home about. So can you just help us understand how you’re thinking about maybe success relative to conversions and migrations of existing customers this year and then I had a quick follow up for Brian. Thanks.
Lynn Moore: Yes. Sure. Robin. I think you’re right. I flipped actually, I think there are quite a bit year-over-year. I think this year, we did about 336 flips. Last year, we did about 239 flips give or take. So roughly 40%. I see flips being a significant driver of revenue growth over the next five to seven years. I see them continuing to grow at a healthy pace. And I don’t really, I’m not in a position to tell you that we’re going to grow North of 15%, 20% each year, but we have a wide and deep customer base, that has become a priority, and we’re prioritizing our flips internally.
Rob Oliver: And then Brian, just one on the Q4 operating margin was a bit below our expectations. And that could be driven indeed, by those flips, or by NIC but just wanted to get a little bit more color on that. Thanks. 
Brian Miller: Yes, I’d say probably the two biggest factors, there were one that licenses declined pretty significantly. And we’ve talked about that expectation, kind of going into 2023 but Q4 had a bit of a deeper decline from the mix of new business. So licenses were relatively low number. And, again, most of that is a shift in the mix as opposed to less new business. We did as we typically have with our more license heavy products and public safety and platform technologies some slippage out of the quarter in terms of timing, but that’s pretty typical. So I’d say that the lower licenses were the big factor. And then probably the other factor is the higher R&D expense that we mentioned were some expenses that we had expected to be capitalized were actually expense because of the nature of the development efforts. And so that impacted our margins as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt VanVliet with BTIG. Your line is now open. 
Matt VanVliet: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess looking at the margin guide for ‘23 Brian and just trying to reconcile kind of where we were previously to maybe some of the moving parts and you just mentioned the R&D coming in higher on a expense level than capital wonder if you could sort of quantify how much of that sort of changed versus what you were previously expecting and looked like around maybe 6 million flip from capitalized to expense in the fourth quarter. Curious if you have a general sense of what that level will be in ‘23. And then secondarily, just how much of the compression on the EBIT or on the operating margin side is from the declining license mix versus the bubble costs versus those R&D expenses. Thanks.
Brian Miller: Yes. So yes, for the full year, the difference in the capitalize versus expensed R&D versus our expectation was close to $9 million. We gave guidance for R&D for next year, in the range of $108 million to $110 million that’s expensed and our capitalized R&D in 2023 is expected to be in the high 30s, say around $37 million. So capitalization is a little bit higher, but R&D expense is higher in 2023. If you look at the sort of the midpoint of our guidance, it implies I’d say somewhere between 60 and 100 basis points of operating margin compression in total and we mentioned that the bubble costs are estimated to be about 130 basis points of impact on 2023 margins. 
Matt VanVliet: New bubble cost?
Brian Miller: New bubble costs. So and that’s higher than the impact was in 2022. We talked about those as being a little less than 100 basis points of impact and that’s to be expected, because we continue to move more customers into the public cloud and while we still operating our two data centers and so the duplicate costs expand this year, and we’ve talked about an expectation in the first half of 2024 that will be out of the first data centers and that’ll start to mitigate.
Matt VanVliet: Okay, very helpful. And then looking at just trying to square together some of the numbers with the commentary, it sounds like the subscription side and certainly SaaS embedded within that continues to perform quite well. And you’re seeing not only new customers, but the flips, sort of at elevated rates. But definitely look at the backlog numbers on the subscription side, there was a slight decline sort of quarter-over-quarter, while maintenance continued to climb. So just curious if there were, I guess any mix of some of the renewals that maybe were anticipated the flip that maybe didn’t in the quarter or anything on that front that would sort of lead to the optics of the subscription backlog declining slightly, while the sort of looking ahead version and the qualitative commentary around strong bookings would push more to the subscription side, maybe in ‘23 than what we saw in Q4.
Brian Miller: Yes, I think one of the bigger factors around backlog I think backlog is probably becomes maybe a little less meaningful or less of a full picture when you look at it is really around how the accounting drives what goes into backlog and what doesn’t. So transaction revenues don’t sit in the backlog. So as we add new payments or new portal revenues, those typically are under fixed arrangements so even though they may be highly predictable and recurring. So there typically wouldn’t be an addition to backlog for those.  And then we’ve talked in the past as well about sometimes the terms of a contract agreement dictate how much goes into backlog. So for example, a termination for convenience provision can significantly limit that we saw that with a really large contract last quarter. That was a 50 plus million dollar contract that only $8 million went into backlog because that’s a termination for convenience provision. So I think there’s a lot of factors that start to make the backlog number maybe less of an important metric to look at how we expect to perform going forward. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Heckmann with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.
Peter Heckmann: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I have a few just clarifications there. And I may have missed some detail. So forgive me if I’m repeating myself. But when we look at bookings we typically see this quarter as a big public safety bookings quarter. Can you talk about how they are receiving the idea of converting to subscription? And then just clarifying, were there any deals with containers in bookings in the quarter that were greater than 5 million of TCB?
Lynn Moore: Yes. Sure Pete. On the public safety side, it is typically a little bit larger quarter. we don’t typically talk about deals that we’ve awarded, but not signed. I will say that we had a couple of deals that were of significance that that pushed for the quarter. We are continuing to see more and more acceptance on the public safety side to the SaaS model and to subscriptions. And I think we’re going to continue to see that going forward. It’s part of our actual in our budget process. If you look generally across Tyler, I think for next year on a sort of an overall weighted value average, we’re expecting north of 90%, 91% of deals next year to be in SaaS with a significant increase on the public safety side, still less than half on the public safety side. But it is something that we’re doing some modeling and some things that we’re trying to do to sort of push that model with our clients.
Brian Miller: Yes, and this quarter, we did not have any individual contracts that were more than $5 million in total contract values. We had a couple in the $4 million range on the software side. We did have a competitive rebid when, with our state enterprise agreement in Colorado, which is one of our bigger states. And certainly the total value of that contract over the five year term is well above $5 million. But on the software side, no individual deals more than 5 million. So it was more of a high volume sort of more mid range deals this quarter. 
Peter Heckmann: Got it. And so to your point that bookings might be come up with slightly less useful metric given how you gross up the TCB related to variable revenue streams and contracts. I missed what you said on the 500 and some payments deals. What was the TCB related to that and then can you get given an approximation of how much that was included in for your bookings? Did it have just been your estimate of the first year? 
Brian Miller: Yes, and actually on the payment deal, that there really wouldn’t be anything that in the bookings number, only the actual revenues as they come through in a given quarter basically run through bookings and revenue at the same time. So for payments, we don’t include it again, because they’re not a fixed amount. We don’t include those in bookings or in backlog. But those payments deals for the full year we estimate that they’ll add more than $13 million in annual recurring revenues. And there’s a mixture of contracts there that are either gross or net processing through our platform and still some deals that are through our reseller arrangements where we have a revenue sharing arrangement. So the revenues are lower but the margins are higher on those. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. 
Alex Zukin: Yes, hey, guys. So maybe just two for me. I guess the first one just similar to one of the questions, I think that’s been asked, but maybe on a slightly different metrics. Again, the subscription ARR added in the quarter this quarter seemed to be lower sequentially than the last two. So just maybe clarifying what drove that from a bookings perspective? And then more broadly, as we are much more geared towards subscription and SaaS, how should we think about at least how were you guys thinking about kind of net new SaaS ARR, net new kind of subscription bookings growth for ‘23? And then I have got a quick follow up on cash flow.
Brian Miller: Well. We expect, clearly we expect the subscription booking and subscription ARR will accelerate from 2022 and 2023, both on the transaction side and the SaaS software side. Part of that, again, the change in the mix accelerating in a more significant decline in licenses this year with that being replaced by new subscription arrangements. I think the question about just the new subscription ARR again, that number really just relates to new software deals. And as you said, there weren’t any mega deals in this quarter. But a good volume of sort of midsized deals. I think more that’s just around the timing. We’ve said that the pipeline continues to be very strong. RFP activity remains generally stable at pretty elevated levels of the market activity supports that expectation that we’ll continue to see an accelerating rate of new software ARR. 
Alex Zukin: And then I guess, Brian, from a free cash flow perspective, when you think about the lag or the delta between operating margins and free cash flow for this year, it’s obviously a little bit higher than in previous years, given some of the items you mentioned around tax and expense or capitalization versus some R&D expenses. As we think about it for ‘23 and even more so for ‘24. What’s the right expectation for free cash flow margins versus operating margins? And that delta specifically in these two years as we kind of trough margins and transition to SaaS? 
Brian Miller: Yes, I think, generally, we would expect that and we talked about what are our capitalization, our CapEx, both software and non-software CapEx is for 2023. That’s a bit higher. And some of that’s related to software CapEx and some of that’s related to facilities investments that we’re making in a couple of particular locations as expected in ‘24, that that CapEx would decline. In general, I think our cash flow margin would grow in line with a faster than our operating margin. Once that CapEx starts to normalize. The impact of the Section 174, which is still a bit unclear, will be significant on cash flow in 2023. Because if it stands, if it’s not repealed, and we’re not the first company or the first software company to talk about this, you’re starting to see more of it. I know Microsoft talked about a more than billion dollar impact on their taxes. But if it stands and isn’t repealed or delayed, that our cash tax payments will be significantly higher this year because we’ll have the impact of both sort of catching up the 2022 taxes under that assumption and making cash tax payments related to 2023. So it could be in the 100 million dollar range of additional cash taxes this year, which would really, as I said, the two years impact, roughly $50 million related to 2022 and 50, related to 2023 in round numbers. So we’ll see how that plays out. But that’s sort of the current expectation. And given the way that tax change works, it will impact cash taxes for five years until it normalizes and you’re putting on the same amount that you’re amortizing.
Alex Zukin: Understood, so, I guess, is it fair once we get through ‘23 and CapEx starts to trend down would you expect it to kind of go back to that historical still 200 to 300 point delta between margins and free cash flow margins? operating margin? 
Brian Miller: I think that’s fair. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gabriella Borges with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. 
Gabriella Borges: Hi, good morning. Thank you. Lynn I want to follow up on some of your comments on the demand environment. I think last quarter, you talked about procurement cycle stretching out a little bit, maybe just give us an update there and are you seeing any issue positive or negative with this topic shortages, negative being bottlenecking on procurement and positive being, hey, we don’t have enough work through we need to accelerate our adoption of technology at your customer base. 
Brian Miller: Gabri, I don’t. Right now, procurement cycles are pretty normal. They’re going in line with our clients budgets are healthy. And we’re not really seeing delayed procurement cycles right now. Again, from our perspective, the market is relatively healthy, their budgets are healthy, and our competitive position remains strong. So we’re seeing a pretty normal, really above normal market.
Gabriella Borges: My follow-up is on competitive position. So as you think about the progress you’ve made with your cloud transition, and really leaning into that, is there a scenario where you see a pace of share gain, or your pace of displacement incumbents accelerate? Is that something you potentially are already seeing, and that’s something that could be on the cards a little bit on how it advantages you competitively? Thank you.
Brian Miller: I’ll take, I’ll start on that and Lynn can add to that. We do think that in our space, that the shift to the cloud and our cloud strategy gives us a competitive advantage. As you know, we compete across products with different competitors, and generally in each of our products suite. And those range from some very large companies to a lot of smaller, more niche e-companies. And we think that where we are in the cloud transition, is well in advance of where a lot of our competitors are. And as that desire, on our client base to move to the cloud accelerates that gives us an advantage and an ability to increase our share because of where we are in our cloud transition. And then, as we’ve talked about in the past, our connected communities vision, and the fact that we have this broad suite of products that work increasingly well together, continues to provide us with a competitive advantage there in clients that are looking for a sweet solution. And we think that this could be one of our strengths.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays, Your line is now open. 
Saket Kalias: Okay, great. Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Lynn maybe start with you. That was helpful detail in your prepared remarks just on the composition of NIC or digital payments. When it comes to gross versus net? Maybe the question is, Could you put a finer point, just on how much of that digital payments business or the transaction revenue one is gross versus net and then relatedly, how you maybe think about that mix going forward? 
Lynn Moore: Yes, I’ll start and varnish probably got better numbers. NIC which in our digital solutions division, I would say the overwhelming majority of their payments business was on a gross basis. I would say on the Tyler side beforehand, more of it’s been on the net basis. That’s actually not a lever that we fully control. It’s generally controlled by the customer and whether or not the customer is wants to take the risk and on the interchange fees or if not, there’s a number of factors that go into there. But as of right now, a substantial part of Tyler’s overall business is on the gross model because of NIC and more NIC was how mature and vast that business was. We’ve got the number for merchant fees that we passed through last year was about I think, on the NIC side was about $142 million. And maybe just a handful of $3 million, $4 million, $5 million on the Tyler side. And looking at it next year I think NIC side is probably more around 145-ish million again with the same few million more on top from Tyler. 
Brian Miller: I don’t know that. I have a lot to add to that. It clearly is the vast majority. We did mention that a couple of our date enterprise agreements that digital solutions are shifting in 2023 to net from gross and that’s got about a $2.5 million impact. But as Lynn said, we don’t really fully control that. And so I would expect that still going forward, the majority of the business comes to us through the gross model where we’re paying the merchant fees which is why we wanted to sort of give you the apples to apples comparison of the margin impact of a couple of 100 basis points, if all of those net ones were on the gross model, and you took the merchant fees out of the revenue side. So I would say that as more Tyler customers that have traditionally been on a sort of a reseller with third party payment processors, where we get a revenue share, which is a net accounting, as more of those overtime migrate to our proprietary platform, we could have a shift with from those customers that are currently on a net basis moving to a gross basis with Tyler. The net result is we keep more of the transaction. So we make more money. We’d have higher revenues, but it would have a negative impact on margins. And we’ll attempt at our investor day to provide more color on how those work and how we see that playing out. Because clearly significant growth in the payments business is an objective of ours and something that we’re having a lot of success with and expect to continue to.
Saket Kalias: Got it. That’s very helpful. Brian, maybe for my follow up, and apologies. I think this question has been asked a couple different ways. I just, I want to one other way. The question is, maybe how SaaS ARR did versus your own expectations this quarter? I think you said that maybe it was timing. We expect SaaS ARR to accelerate next year. I think it grew about 19% this quarter. I know the last quarter had some big deal activity that maybe makes it a tough sequential compare. But I’m just kind of curious how you think about sort of that that SaaS ARR growth trajectory this year? And if there’s anything that we should keep in mind, for how that performed this quarter versus your expectations? 
Brian Miller: Yes, I think it was generally in line with our expectation. I don’t know that it was significantly varied from plan. I guess one other factor that plays into that is the lag between when we sign a SaaS deal and when we start to recognize revenues. And that can vary, but it can be typically the implementations are quicker or the time from signing to starting to recognize revenues is quicker on a SaaS deal than on an on-prem deal. But that can vary and that can typically be, say six months that can be longer. And so I think when I talk about timing, it’s more around the difference between when we signed something and when we’re starting to recognize revenues.
Lynn Moore: I’d say there’s two things around timing one is, just as Brian mentioned, yes in the old days, when you sign an on-prem license, you recognize the entire license upfront. On a SaaS deal, particularly when we’re doing multi suite, multi module deals, they’re generally going to start paying those when those particular modules or pieces go live. So you’ve got to delay from the time you sign to where you get first parts of the customer up live. But as you continue that implementation and other pieces go live, then you will get that build up. I say the other side is when you look at flips there’s things around flips that while long term, obviously provide really great long term value and the short term sometimes we’re providing some services, perhaps that discount or no charge. There also might be some concessions depending on how long the customer has had their license and where they sit. And so to sort of incentivize the flip, there’s sometimes some sort of upfront concession, which can then create another lag factor before you get the full value of that flip.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Your line is now open.
Jonathan Ho: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to I guess, touch a little bit about cross sell activity which you spoke about quite a bit. Is there anything that we could expect to see either inflect or grow even more for 2023 as the NIC relationship has had a little bit more time to mature and with some of the new acquisitions.
Brian Miller: Yes, Jonathan, I mean, cross selling is one of our major mid to long term growth drivers. It’s something we’re talking about internally, as you look out over the next seven, eight years to about Tyler 2030. And things that can, quote, really move the needle. It’s these things like flips, its payments, it’s cross selling, it’s also a lot of other things that we do really well. And we’ve talked about areas of our business like supervision, where the where the market is good, where the TAM is good, and where we’re making really big gains there. But cross selling is something that we’re prioritizing across all of Tyler, where we’ve actually started some new sort of strategic account management approach within NIC and bringing other resources, getting even further exposure to our sales channels, our sales leads. There are things that we will be working on in terms of internally around how we recognize revenue from cross sells, and how we incentivize things and structurally internally, things that we need to sort of clear out some of those barriers to sort of unleash that power even more. We’re pretty excited about it. I mean we had probably this past quarter, probably one of the best stories we’ve had in a long time in terms of both cross selling and sort of connected communities which was the Kansas Department of Revenue story that I mentioned in my opening remarks. This was a deal where this deal took place because of our DNI solution around assessments, and the fact that we had such a broad footprint and presence within the state of Kansas from our enterprise assessment. But it also didn’t happen without NIC and their contacts at the state and utilizing that state master contract. So that was three different pieces of our organization coming together to create a really great result and something that I think we can replicate across other states that deals a $600,000, AAR deal, really an ideal, but really took the efforts of multiple divisions to do that. And I think that’s sort of an example of what we’re looking to do in the future. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Your line is now open. 
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, guys, it’s actually Peter on for Kirk. Appreciate taking the questions. So maybe, Brian, just one for you. Curious are we at the point where there should sort of be more stability in terms of the impact of this subscription transition on revenue versus your guidance? I mean, I think we all get the moving target, but just curious if the level of dispersion is likely to go down from here on that, in that sense?
Brian Miller: Yes, I think so. We certainly expect a bigger decline in licensed revenues this year. Licenses are always the most, or the least predictable of our revenue streams at least in the short term. And so now with well into the 80s, is the percentage of our revenues that are recurring. There’s much less, a much higher level of predictability. So I think we’re definitely kind of around that corner. And in that there should be an increasingly higher level of confidence around our outlooks versus what we actually where results come in.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Terry Tillman with Truist Securities. Your line is now open. 
Terry Tillman: Hey, good morning. Thanks for filling me in. Unfortunately, for you all still have some more questions, even though a bunch have been answered. Maybe Lynn the first question for you. It’s kind of a twofold first question. And then Brian, I was going to ask you about payments. So Lynn, in terms of those couple of larger public safety deals that slid into the first half. Do you expect those pulls in the first quarter? And then the second part of that first question for you is, you had a great deal last quarter with the Department of State and I know it’s still small in terms of the federal sector for you all. But just anything you can share about optimism in more we could hear this year on that side. And then I want to ask you about payments, Brian? 
Lynn Moore: Yes, my expectation is that at least one of those larger deals is on track to close in Q1. As it relates to Tyler federal. I think you’re right. I mean, things that I’m seeing that’s coming out of that that division, in terms of sales indicators, the pipeline, the volume of deals is up significantly since year-over-year. We’re also seeing interesting going up more and more movement in the federal side to SaaS, which is good to see. It’s something that we put an internal focus on in the last two years. And we’re starting to see more of that receptiveness there. So I think there’s positive things coming out of the federal space. And I like our position there right now.
Terry Tillman: That’s great to hear. And then Brian we’ve gotten a lot of data points on payments, and there’s lots of puts and takes up particularly the gross to net or when there’s a rev share, but could you just like really try to help boil it down in terms of for ‘23, the payments revenue business? I mean would that grow at about a similar rate in ‘22, or just anything you can share about the growth rate on the recognized revenue for payments? Thank you. 
Brian Miller: Yes, I think the growth rate on payments is going to be above Tyler’s overall growth rate is going to be a positive contributor. And I expect that, in general, that will be accelerating from 2022 both from adding new customers through the cross sell motion, which we talked about, we’ve integrated our payments teams. We’ve really got the go to market strategy down and now we’re starting to execute on it. Whether it’s using the expanded capabilities around that NICs platform brought us to drive that business down into the local level, continuing to have a focus on penetrating more of our customer base with payments, either with our product form or partner platforms, driving more adoption into the customer base. And then the addition of rapid so giving us capabilities on the disbursement side. And we’ve got some really interesting opportunities around that and think that’s going to be a nice growth driver. So I’d say we generally expect the payments business to grow faster than sort of Tyler’s top line revenues at least in 2023. 
Lynn Moore: As we have our inside sales focusing on that existing customer base. When you look at areas like our enterprise side, whether it’s enterprise ERP we’re including payments in all new responses, all new deal responses, that doesn’t mean they’re out there getting an every new deal, but we are pushing payments in all of our new deals.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Reilly with Needham, Your line is now open. 
Joshua Reilly: Thanks, guys for squeezing me in. I’ll just ask one question here since we’re running over time. The software development costs were only 2 million in the quarter, which is obviously below what we were expecting. Can you just discuss the impact of the accounting changes to this figure? And how guidance of 37 million for 2023 is the proper amount implying an increase given the accounting changes that we have here?
Brian Miller: Yes, the guidance for 2023 of $37 million in capitalized software development encompasses how we expect those projects to be accounted for. So that’s reflect, the impact of that change is reflected there as well as other capitalized development projects that are either starting or ramping up during the year. So that’s fully encompassed there. But the change in expensing versus capitalizing for the full year of 2022 had about a $9 million impact versus what our initial guidance for capitalized software and R&D was.
Joshua Reilly: And was that just reflected in that Q4 number, then the full $9 million impact? Or how was that only 2 million, I guess in the quarter? 
Brian Miller: Well, it impacted the full year, but most of that impact was seen in the Q4 results. So that resulted in a much lower number in Q4 versus the rest of the year. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David [Indiscernible] with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. 
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks very much for squeezing me and I appreciate it. Just one for me. Brian, I heard your comments in the prepared remarks. You’re touching on growing implementations team or 2023 to meet backlog. Can you just talk about the labor market trends you’re seeing and where you stand currently in terms of hires? What we’re seeing in terms of wage inflation, etc? Thank you. 
A – Brian Miller: Yes, there continues to be challenges in the labor market but it’s definitely mitigating from what we saw last year. Obviously, it’s been very common across multiple industries, but certainly in technology where you’re seeing layoffs, hiring freezes, and so there’s less pressure. I think, on us in terms of turnover which is moderating, and there’s less pressure than we saw last year on wage increases. So each of those are working in a positive manner for us.
Lynn Moore: Yes, I’d say, David if you go back 12 months ago, we were still experiencing really pretty high elevated turnover, still lower than industry, but higher than our norms, which, as you know, was all companies we’re dealing with. As we progress throughout the year, things started, I think there’s I talk a lot about the pendulum and the labor market pendulum is another one that I talked about. And it’s definitely started to swing back as we fell back into sort of November, December, I would say our turnover has actually come back down to sort of pre-COVID levels. Still early to see if that’s where it stays. But I like words, it’s I like that trend. As it relates to things like that Brian mentioned our services and implementation. That was an area that was hit particularly hard over the last couple years, and we’ve won a lot of business. We do have to do some hiring to ramp up to deliver on that business. And we’re doing that. It’s also creates a little bit of margin pressure in the near term. Because when we hire large classes of implementers, it normally takes four or five, six months before we get them out billable on the road.
Brian Miller: Most of the growth in our headcount this year will be in revenue generating positions. 
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. 
Keith Housum: morning, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I’m just unpacking the payments just a little bit further. The 571 wins is obviously a phenomenal number for the year. Are these mostly agencies that are we taking on that payments for the first time, or at least actually competitive with and what do you see the trajectory I guess in 2023 for that same question? 
Brian Miller: I’d say the majority of that number, although not the majority of the dollars, but the majority of the number would be certainly new payments for most of this customer. So a lot of those are existing Tyler customers where we’re adding payments to a utility billing system or a licensing and permitting system. So we may be adding capabilities. they may have only taken checks before and now we’re providing online payment capabilities or credit card payments. And a number of those are still under rev share agreements. So the revenue generated is on an individual payment opportunity may be relatively small, but at good margins. But some of the more significant wins are competitive wins, like we mentioned the City of Milwaukee. That’s a full enterprise payment processing contract. And we’re replacing another vendor there. So I’d say the larger wins tend to be competitive ones, the smaller ones tend to be more first time payments. 
Operator: This concludes our question and answer session for today. I turn the call back over to you Lynn Moore. 
Lynn Moore : Great. Thanks, everybody for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Brian Miller or myself. Have a great day everybody.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-27 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to today's Tyler Technologies Third Quarter 2022 Conference Call. Your host for today’s call is Lynn Moore, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. And as a reminder, this is conference is being recorded today, October 27th, 2022. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Moore. Please go ahead.
Lynn Moore: Thank you, Cheryl, and welcome to our call. With me today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I’d like for Brian to give the Safe Harbor statement. Next, I’ll have some comments on our quarter, and then Brian will review the details of our results. I’ll end with some additional comments, and then we’ll take questions. Brian?

Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Lynn?
Lynn Moore: Thanks Brian. Our third quarter results were highlighted by strong execution that drove solid organic revenue growth and higher earnings while also advancing our cloud-first strategy. Total revenues grew approximately 3% with organic growth, excluding COVID-related revenues of approximately 9%. Recurring revenues comprised 78.5% of our quarterly revenues. On an organic basis, excluding COVID-related revenues, subscription revenue grew 14.5%, reflecting both our accelerating shift to the cloud and growth in transaction-based revenues. We achieved solid revenue growth even as the shift in new software contracts mix continue to accelerate to SaaS from licenses. In Q3, 91% of our new software contract value was SaaS compared to 74% in Q3 last year. Our largest new software contract for the quarter was with the US Department of State for our case management development platform, formerly known as entellitrak. This five-year SaaS arrangement is valued at over $54 million and includes over $5 million of ARR in the first year, ramping to over $8.5 million of ARR in the fifth year. However, due to certain contract terms, only approximately $8 million of the value of this contract is included in backlog and bookings for the third quarter. The second largest deal of the quarter was a five-year SaaS deal for our enterprise supervision solution with the Arizona Office of the Courts valued at over $15 million. This arrangement includes two five-year optional renewals and with add-on components has the potential to grow to more than $82 million over 15 years. We also signed a notable statewide SaaS deal for our enterprise supervision solution with the State of Oregon Judicial Department valued at approximately $3.5 million. These contracts are great examples of our ability to make a strategic tuck-in acquisition and grow the acquired products by leveraging our client base and sales channel. When we acquired CaseloadPRO, which is now our Enterprise Supervision Product four years ago, its annual revenues were approximately $2.7 million. This quarter alone, our new sales of Enterprise Supervision added almost $4 million of ARR. In other Tyler divisions, we signed five additional significant SaaS deals each for different product suites and each with a total contract value greater than $2 million. Those include Pierce County, Washington for our Enterprise Assessment and Tax solution, the City of Abilene, Texas, the Resin Unified School District in Wisconsin, and Alachua County, Florida for our Enterprise ERP solution, the Toronto Region Conservation Authority in Ontario for Enterprise Permitting and Licensing Solution. In addition, we signed 12 SaaS deals in the quarter with contract values between $1 million and $2 million each. We also signed three notable license deals in the quarter for Enterprise Public Safety, Enforcement Mobile and Data & Insight solutions. With Hidalgo County, Texas, which was funded by ARPA, the combined Regional Communications Authority in Colorado and the city of Melbourne, Florida. Also during the third quarter, we successfully renewed our NIC enterprise contract in Alabama and won a competitive rebid for our enterprise contract in Maine. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, in October, we renewed our NIC enterprise contract in Oklahoma, and our contract in Pennsylvania is expected to expire in the fourth quarter. We also converted our State of Iowa data and insights agreement from a third-party reseller to the NIC master contract. In addition, NIC signed a new four-year SaaS agreement for our medical cannabis regulation solution with the Arkansas Department of Health, Medical cannabis licensing with ARR of approximately $450,000. Before I turn the call over to Brian, I'd like to comment on the Rapid Financial Solutions acquisition we announced this morning. We're extremely excited to partner with the innovative team at Rapid, who will join our payments group. Rapid is a leader in the payment solutions market with 20 years' experience and expands our capabilities with best-in-class digital disbursements. We will now be able to offer our public sector clients a reliable, scalable, and secure platform for disbursing payments. Rapid has more than 1,500 customers concentrated in courts and correction facilities which includes managing disbursements for VendEngine, which we acquired in September of last year. Combined with our approximately 7,200 clients in the payment space, we believe this is a significant opportunity to leverage the full suite of market-leading payment solutions to make customer interactions stronger and more secure. Now, I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results of the quarter, and our annual guidance for 2022.
Brian Miller: Thanks Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the third quarter ended September 30th, 2022. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We have also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financials tab, schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. Both GAAP and non-GAAP revenues for the quarter were $473.2 million, up 2.9% and 2.7%, respectively. Organic revenue growth, excluding COVID-related revenues was strong at 9% on a GAAP basis and 8.8% on a non-GAAP basis. NIC's COVID-related revenues for the quarter were $11.7 million compared to $43.3 million in last year's third quarter. Revenue from the TourHealth initiative ended in the second quarter and the Virginia Rent Relief program has now officially ended with less than $2 million of remaining revenues anticipated in the fourth quarter. License revenue declined 10.6% as our new software contract mix has shifted to SaaS even more rapidly than planned at the beginning of the year. Professional services revenues rose 15.7% and 6.3% organically. We intend to continue to grow our implementation team during the fourth quarter to support delivery of our growing backlog and pipeline, but we'll likely continue to see some pressure on professional services revenue in the near term as those teams ramp up to become fully billable. Subscriptions revenue was just slightly above Q3 of last year due to the expected $37 million decline in COVID-related subscription revenue, but organically rose 14.5%. We added 153 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 70 existing on-premises clients, representing a total of approximately $149 million in contract value. In Q3 of last year, we added 144 new subscription-based arrangements and had 67 on-premises conversions, representing a total of approximately $84 million in contract value. Our software subscription bookings in the third quarter added $28.1 million in new ARR. Subscription contract value comprised a new high of approximately 91% of total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 74% in Q3 of last year. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 3.8 years compared to 3.4 years last year. Transaction-based revenues, which include NIC portal, payment processing and e-filing revenues and are included in subscriptions, were $148.9 million, down 13% but excluding COVID-related revenue, grew 11.1%. E-filing revenue reached a new high of $19.7 million, up 13.3%. Our non-GAAP ARR was approximately $1.49 billion, which was flat with last year, but up 11.2%, excluding COVID-related revenues. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS software arrangements was $421.7 million, up 27.7%. Transaction-based ARR was $595.6 million, down 13%, but up 11.1%, excluding COVID-related revenues. Non-GAAP maintenance ARR was flat with Q3 last year at $469.4 million due to the continued migration of on-premises clients to the cloud. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was a new high of $1.88 billion, up 6.3%. Bookings in the quarter were approximately $499 million, down 17% on a difficult comparison to Q3 of last year for three main reasons. First, Q3 of last year included the State of Illinois fixed fee e-filing renewal of approximately $63 million. Second, COVID-related revenues and bookings were approximately $43 million in Q3 last year, versus $11 million in the current quarter. And finally, most of the Federal Department of State deals signed this quarter was not included in backlog or bookings. Normalizing for these items, bookings grew 7.7%. On an organic basis, bookings were approximately $364 million, down 17.9%, but grew 7.7% on a normalized basis. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1.9 billion, up 18.1% and on an organic basis, were approximately $1.4 billion, up 2.1%. As a result of an increase in our estimated research tax credit, our annual GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates were positively affected. Our non-GAAP annual effective tax rate is now 22.5%, down from the 24% previously used and the non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 19.6% to adjust the year-to-date tax rate. This resulted in an $0.11 uplift to our third quarter non-GAAP EPS. For the full year, we expect this tax rate change to impact non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.14. Cash flows from operations were $129.4 million, down 37% and free cash flow was $115.6 million, down 40%, mainly due to the timing of working capital items such as payroll accruals, remittance of portal fees, and taxes and we expect to see positive impacts of these timing items in the fourth quarter. We continue to strengthen our already solid balance sheet. During the quarter, we repaid $190 million of our term debt and since completing the NIC acquisition, we have paid down $665 million of term debt. We ended the quarter with total outstanding debt of $1.085 billion and cash and investments of $247.9 million. As a reminder, $600 million of our debt is in the form of convertible debt with a fixed interest rate of 0.25%. The remaining $485 million is in pre-payable term debt due in 2024 and 2026, with interest at floating rates based on LIBOR plus a margin of 125 or 150 basis points. So, our exposure to floating rates is limited. We also have an undrawn $500 million revolver. Our net leverage at quarter end was approximately 1.79 times trailing 12-month pro forma EBITDA. Looking forward, we have adjusted the upper end of our full year revenue guidance to reflect lower license revenue as a result of a higher SaaS mix as well as the timing of new license contracts in our Public Safety and Federal divisions along with ongoing pressures on professional services revenue. Adjusted for the change in our effective tax rate, the midpoint of our non-EPS guidance is unchanged. Our updated 2022 guidance is as follows; we expect both GAAP and non-GAAP total revenues will be between $1.837 billion and $1.857 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 8%. We expect total revenues will include approximately $49 million of COVID-related revenues from NIC's TourHealth and Pandemic Rent Relief services. Revenue from TourHealth ended in the second quarter, while revenue from the Rent Relief program is expected to end in the fourth quarter. We expect GAAP EPS will be between $3.89 and $4.05 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock option activity on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $7.51 and $7.65. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $28 million, including approximately $7 million of non-cash amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs. For the full year, the net impact of the change in our tax rate, offset by increases in estimated interest expense, resulted in a $0.02 net reduction in non-GAAP EPS compared to our initial guidance. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn for his comments.
Lynn Moore: Thanks Brian. We're encouraged by continued strength in the public sector markets as reflected stable or increasing RFP and demo activity across our business units and a strong competitive position that continues to drive high win rates. Key characteristics of the public sector market is its relative stability across economic cycles, given the ongoing need to upgrade and replace aging mission-critical systems with next-generation applications. Our deep domain expertise, combined with the breadth of our product offerings, underscores our unique ability to deliver scalable and innovative digital solutions to meet these mission-critical needs. Our industry-leading competitive position remains high, in part due to our integrated solutions and our ability to expand existing client relationships as we leverage our installed base, the largest in the public sector market. Our cross-sell pipeline continues to grow, particularly as we begin to gain momentum with our NIC go-to-market strategy and leverage our strong sales organization and client relationships. Our pipeline of sell-through opportunities with NIC State Enterprise relationships expanded approximately 16% in the third quarter with emerging opportunities across multiple solutions with many influenced by our Enterprise Data and Insights offering. Additionally, we are seeing larger deal opportunities in the pipeline that require longer procurement cycles. Our cloud-first strategy is also tracking well as we continue to invest in optimizing products for more efficient cloud deployment and as higher cloud adoption is reflected in the mix of our new business pipeline. Our expectation of the SaaS mix for new business for this year and 2023 have increased since the beginning of the year. We've talked about the impact of our accelerated move to the cloud on our margins in 2022 and the expectation that we will see further margin contraction in 2023 before rebounding in 2024. In addition to impacting margins, the accelerated pace and the shift in new business mix towards SaaS puts pressure on revenue growth as we now expect 2022 license revenue to decline more than previously expected. We expect that trend to continue into 2023 and we are pleased that our early planning for next year indicates that SaaS adoption should increase even faster than previously expected, even in our Public Safety and federal divisions. As a result, we expect to see license revenue decline even more previously than anticipated with the license decline in the 40% range. Also, a reminder that with NIC's COVID-related initiatives now finished, $49 million of 2022 revenues, of which $11 million were in subscriptions and $38 million were in professional services will not be present in 2023. Despite current macroeconomic uncertainty, we continue to execute against our long-term growth strategy, capitalizing on the durability of our recurring revenue model and solid financial position. We have a proven and successful track record of strategic and opportunistic acquisitions that support our growth priorities, expand our product portfolio, and extend our TAM. As we have commented in the past, we have the benefit of reliable cash flow, enabling us to aggressively manage our debt profile and impact from rising interest rates. We expect to continue to delever and use excess cash to reduce debt while still taking advantage of strategic acquisitions at reasonable valuations such as Rapid, which further enhances our ability to address the significant public sector payments TAM. Our business is resilient and while we are not immune to the effects of inflation, the long-term capital investment decisions we've made in strengthening our products and shifting to a cloud-first approach are foundational to driving sustainable growth and delivering stakeholder value. With that, we'd like to open the line for Q&A.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Sami Badri of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Sami Badri: Hi, thank you. I have a couple of questions. First one is there was a mention of the ARPA project that was funded using federal funds. Could you kind of give us a characterization of what you guys see as the pipeline of potential projects and opportunities that are coming directly from federal funds? And on the second question -- my next question would be, on the what's a little bit intriguing about you guys making this comment is that it seems to be that there is a significant amount of federal funds being allocated to local governments, federal government, and several other branches. And you think that with those funds being allocated and the speed of those allocations that are now starting to accelerate, do you think that lead-times and procurement cycles would actually start to either stay the same or compress. So, I was hoping you could just kind of explain to us what's going on regarding longer procurement cycles.
Lynn Moore: Yes, sure, Sami. Let me start, and Brian jump in. First, on the ARPA deal, that was a really nice deal for a lot of reasons. As I mentioned in my comments, that was Hidalgo County, Texas. It was a full enterprise public safety suite deal, enforcement mobile civil process. ARPA funds were certainly a factor in getting that deal signed and funded. It's about $1.25 million license deal and about a $450,000 ARR deal. I think also what's interesting about that is that's a deal that also where our Tyler Alliance story really helped close the deal. So, some of the strategic things that we've been talking about are -- again, are continuing to resonate with our clients. It's also interesting because it's an AWS Gov cloud deployment, which is continuing. I think our comments around the -- what we're starting to see is more and more receptiveness in public safety to potentially move into the SaaS world. But yes, it was funded by ARPA. We track ARPA Funds. It's sometimes it's not easy to always identify specific deals tied to ARPA Funds because a lot of times these funds may be used for other things, which then free up funds for deals that we're pursuing. We see ARPA funds more often in areas where they are more like singular purchases. We expect to see some, for example, in school bus transportation deal where they're purchasing a large amount of hardware or something like that. The comment on longer procurement cycles, I don't want that to be taken out of context really. I think our cycles generally are on track with where they've been. I think the comment was really meant to say, as we're looking at more and more cross-sell opportunities through NIC and as those deals are getting larger, some of those larger deals are taking a little bit longer, but I wouldn't characterize procurement cycles across the Tyler portfolio of products is actually getting longer. So, if we misspoke there, I want to make that clarification.
Sami Badri: Got it. Thank you. Maybe just -- maybe double-clicking on the procurement cycles, excluding NIC and big deals. Are you starting to see an acceleration of deals getting signed as a function of federal funds, or has that not translated, or is not -- is that not really going through the way maybe some people thought it would go through in 2022?
Lynn Moore: Yeah. I don't think right now it's necessarily accelerating deals. We've talked before about our public sector clients. Their budgets are already healthy. The ARPA Funds are there. And as you know, some of them have limits on when those funds need to be spent. I don't think we're seeing that right now as a sense of urgency or emergency that they've got to flush all that through right now. And will that change over the next 12 months? It might, but we're not seeing that right now.
Sami Badri: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Pete Heckmann of D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Pete Heckmann: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Could you just revisit that piece you mentioned there towards the end of your prepared comments regarding the continued shift to software and potentially an acceleration of a decline in software license fees, could you repeat that comment? And then just specifically what time period are you looking at? Is it just reflecting next year, or I guess, is it a one-time event, or you expect really the software -- the remaining software revenue to decline faster than you had originally expected?
Lynn Moore: Yeah. Thanks, Pete. So I think what we're seeing is different divisions, different product suites have been moving at different paces to the cloud. Some of them we've talked before, like this year, our enterprise ERP solution is almost exclusively this year, and we budgeted this year to move to the cloud. Our lower end, or formerly our LGD, but our ERP Pro solution has continued to go at accelerated rates. What we're seeing is in areas, for example, like our enterprise, permitting and licensing solution, we budgeted this year that all new deals there would be 75% SaaS. And what we're seeing is they're 100% SaaS. We're starting to see it in our property and recording solutions, particularly our recording solution. We budgeted this year at 60% SaaS, it's 85% SaaS. What we're starting to see now also in the market and as we look into next year, is our two divisions, which have had really more dependency on licenses, particularly in the last couple of years has obviously been public safety and Tyler Federal, Tyler Federal has been moving, I think, a little bit faster to SaaS. And we've talked before in the past about public safety's lag. But public safety, what we're seeing now and as we're looking into next year, we're looking at a lot higher subscription based arrangements probably more so than we anticipated earlier in the year. And so as we look into 2023, we're seeing the effects now, but as we preliminary model, and again, this is not a 2023 call, but as we preliminarily look out to 2023, we see the licenses declining at a faster rate than we anticipated. And it's just a little bit shorter timeframe.
Pete Heckmann: Okay. And -- but as an offset, perhaps because you're not seeing necessarily a slowdown in contracting activity your subscription backlog should grow and potentially -- subscription revenue growth on an organic basis, several quarters out continue to be in the mid to high-teens. Does that seem accurate?
Lynn Moore: Yeah, I think so. I mean our market activity -- I'll. The market activity is strong right now. We're not seeing any impact of economic factors that may be affecting other industries, all our leading indicators, RFPs, demos. They've already been elevated. They're either continuing to increase or those elevated levels are being -- are stable right now. So we signed -- in Q3, we actually signed a record number of deals with our enterprise ERP and enterprise permitting and licensing solutions. So, the activity is there, the markets there, our clients' budgets are healthy. And so I think your comments are spot on.
Pete Heckmann: Okay, I appreciate. I'll back in queue.
Operator: Your next question is from Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Kirk Materne: Yes, thanks very much. Lynn, in the cross-sell pipeline, when you think about the deals with NIC that are starting to come about, are there any specific Tyler products that are sort of merging together with NIC better than others, meaning makes sense to see the ERP -- ERP might not make a ton of sense in statewide deals, but I assume it be Courts & Justice. Can you just give a little bit more detail about what product categories or maybe attaching with NIC really well in some of the state deals?
Lynn Moore: Yes, sure, Kirk. It's a good question. I think out of the gate, our data and insights, our analytics product has been something that has been extremely well received, and that's still got a lot of opportunities. We are seeing a lot of areas in courts and justice just cross-selling our payment solutions. Tyler Federal as well. And I think you'll see as time goes on, probably areas like our permitting and licensing products. But the top three or four right now are really our analytics, courts and justice, federal and payments.
Kirk Materne: Okay, that's helpful. And Brian, as we start, I know preliminarily looking forward to 2023, can you just remind us of some of the puts and takes from a margin perspective for you guys next year? I know there's a lot going on with the transition to AWS, but some of the COVID-revenues going away, which I assume is pretty high margin for you all. Can you just give us some puts and takes maybe where you're going to have some pressure on margin, but maybe some offsets to that?
Brian Miller: Yes, I'd say the biggest factor in terms of pressure on margins downward would be around the decline in licenses. So as we talked about in earlier question and during the prepared remarks, a very early look at next year's revenue plans would have licenses declining, perhaps around 40%. And as you know, licenses are very, very high margins. So -- and the time it takes the offsetting subscription revenues for the same deals in a subscription form to ramp up, there's a lag there. So, that would be the biggest downside pressure. The COVID revenue is going away generally. The COVID revenues, at least early on, the tour Health revenues were at lower than our average margins, the Virginia Rent Relief program margins were more in line with our overall margin. So, less of an uplift from those going away, but maybe overall a slight positive impact. And then subscriptions revenue -- I mean, services revenues, we've talked about being under some pressure, mostly from us still ramping up staffing. The services revenues typically are low to no margin revenues. And so the absence of those in the short-term has a positive impact. But again, we expect to ultimately build those back up. So, probably not as much of an overall impact from those, but potentially a slight positive impact from those being a little lighter. But certainly, the license decline around that shift is going to be the biggest factor by us taking a big step forward with that next year.
Lynn Moore: I'd also add, Kirk. We talked about it a lot back in February, a call, I think just sort of the ongoing bubble costs as we make this transition as we're running dual data centers and also moving into AWS. So that puts some pressure. But I would say, as you step back and you look at sort of as how we've been modeling out the next few years, which we've been doing for some time. This is all expected. This is what -- we expected 2023 to sort of be the highest -- the year with the most margin pressure. I think the impact on revenue growth is a little bit more than we expected in the beginning of the year. And I think that's a function of what we were talking about earlier, some of these other divisions probably moving quicker to subscriptions as that Brian just referenced.
Kirk Materne: Got it. Thanks guys. Congrats on the quarter. Operator: Your next question is from Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo Securities. Please, go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Turrin: Hey. Great. Thanks. Good morning. Appreciate you taking the questions. It's pretty clear, just in the commentary, the move to subscription and SaaS is happening a bit quicker than expected. The subscription TCV metric looks great. Can we just spend -- I appreciate just the categories you mentioned, but if you had to characterize why this is happening now, is there anything else you'd add just around how much has been fine-tuning the product set, your own go-to-market versus just customer interest and comfort levels of the cloud picking up and making those conversations a bit more palatable?
Lynn Moore: Yes, I think, it's all of the above, Michael. And we talked about -- what we saw is the changing landscape coming out of COVID. Fortunately, we had internally made this decision before COVID. A lot of it is around sales, how we're incentivizing sales. Some of it -- some announcements we've made around products, how we have various product lines that are over time that started this year that are going to be basically selling a cloud-only version. And so, it's market receptiveness, it's things -- it's improvements in our product and our -- what we've been doing, and it's what we're doing internally to drive that subscription growth.
Michael Turrin: That's helpful. Brian, just one on the financials, if I may. The transaction-based revenue ticked down a bit sequentially. Can you remind us just how much of that is tied to NIC seasonality or just volatility versus some of the one-time impacts there? And maybe how we should think about just the seasonal profile of that line on a go-forward basis?
Brian Miller: Yes, that line does tick down more so in the fourth quarter around seasonality of NIC transaction-based revenues. There's typically around the holidays as you move to the end of the year, there's just fewer transactions going through there. There also was year-over-year, a $37 million reduction in the transaction -- in the COVID revenues that are included in those transaction-based revenues and has also ticked down from Q2. So there's an impact there. And of course, those are going away permanently. But, yes, seasonality, a little bit in Q3, more so in Q4.
Lynn Moore: Yes. I think the -- for NIC, there are state enterprise transactions, which is a growing revenue line, and it's something that we're looking to grow, while it was up in Q3 year-over-year, it was down a little bit from Q2. So as Brian mentioned, Q2 is really the strongest for them seasonally and it goes down a little bit in Q3, and it's expected to taper in Q4, but that's to be expected.
Michael Turrin: That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from William McNemera [ph] of BTIG. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Matt VanVliet: Yes. Thanks. This is Matt VanVliet. I guess, first on the services capacity that you're seeing. You're talking about trying to catch up on hiring and having a little bit of a, I guess, a backlog of services to be deployed. So I guess two-part question. One, when do you expect to feel like you're sort of caught up there from both ramping the ones you've hired now and continuing to hire? And then second part, how much of that is limiting the subscription deployments and with that, the revenue recognition that might have missed or caused a little bit of a shortfall in the subscription growth versus what most of us were modeling?
Brian Miller: Yes, there definitely is a little bit of that there. As you – you noted it's not a lack of services revenues coming in or the contracts being signed and then getting to the related initiation of the subscription revenues, but there have been delays around that. And we added a significant class or classes in late Q2 and have continued to hire in Q3 and Q4. It does seem that turnover, which has been at an elevated level with us as with many companies, does seem to be moderating somewhat. So that's a positive. But we think it's still -- it will take -- there's roughly, call it, a six-month lag time from the time we hire someone to the time they're really fully trained and billable. So this is a multiple quarter sort of exercise to catch back up. And it probably in some of the subscription deals is causing us to be maybe like a quarter or so behind when we might otherwise have started recognizing those revenues I guess, to an offsetting factor to some extent, our clients have often had elevated turnover as well. And so some of it is around client readiness to begin a project. And so some of these projects are delayed slightly because clients need to staff up before they're ready to launch into implementation. So we've seen effects from both sides and -- but there is some lag in the startup of subscription deals that are in backlog.
Matt VanVliet: Okay. Helpful. And then looking at the state department deal that you announced, can you maybe just walk through some of the mechanics of why only a portion of that can be recognized in bookings and backlog, is it something you have to sort of earn your way into those other years on the contract, or how should we think about that going from $8 million to the $50-plus million that's in the headline number?
Brian Miller: Yes, it's really pretty simple. I mean there are effectively termination for convenience provisions in there that we certainly don't expect to be to come into play. But when contracts have those terms under the accounting rules, we can only recognize in backlog and bookings, therefore, the sort of the first year revenues. We certainly expect that the full five years of the contract and potential extensions beyond that would be realized and that we'll get that full contract value, but those contract provisions limit us to what we can put in the backlog.
Matt VanVliet: All right. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Joshua Reilly of Needham. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Joshua Reilly: Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. How much of the decline at the high end of the guidance for the year in revenue is due to customers and public safety, increasingly choosing subscription versus license here in the short term because we know that Q4 is typically a seasonally strong quarter for public safety. And then how should we think about the implied impact to license versus services revenue here in Q4?
Lynn Moore: Hey Josh, let me start and then Brian will jump in. What we're seeing is, like I said, we're seeing more interest in moving to subscription-based models at public safety. A lot of the deals that we still have identified in Q4 are license deals. We have a lot of deals. You're right. Typically, Q4 is a strong quarter. We've got a lot of deals identified, and we've actually been -- we don't talk a lot about the selections, but a lot of selections. What we're seeing and what we're sort of forecasting is that some of those deals will actually slip into next year. So I think that's the majority of that there.
Brian Miller: Yes, for around the timing of deals...
Lynn Moore: Getting done.
Brian Miller: Getting done and whether that falls in Q4 or Q1 versus the mix right now. As we look forward into next year, as Lynn commented earlier, we do believe that a higher percentage of the public safety deals will be subscription deals. But I don't think that's really the case as much in Q4 as it is looking into next year.
Joshua Reilly: Got it. That's super helpful. And then just a follow-up. Our work in the space I think others have been doing as well indicates that the competitive landscape in public safety for RMS and CAD is becoming more favorable for you guys. Can you speak to the opportunity there given your redesigned user interface and now cloud-ready offering for the opportunity to gain further market share there over the next few years? Thanks guys.
Lynn Moore: Yes, Josh, thanks. We like where we sit competitively. As you know, you follow us and I think follow some other players in the space. We've made a lot of investments there. We're winning deals against probably our top competitor there. We just came out of the IACP Conference, which was here in Dallas a couple of weeks ago. There were some interesting things that we saw or didn't see there. Some of those smaller competitors that we sort of grabbed some attention a couple of years ago. There was one that actually didn't have a presence at all. Another competitor had a significantly reduced presence. We've got another one who's carrying significant debt load, and we don't believe they're investing at the rates that they may would like to or certainly not the rates that we've been investing. So, we like where we sit. The investments we've made are paying off. We're still in the process of implementing a lot of deals, and these things take time when you go through this, but we're getting through that cycle and getting those verifications and getting those -- our references get stronger and stronger and I like where we sit with public safety going forward from a competitive standpoint.
Operator: Your next question is from Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Alex Zukin: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. So I guess just a few modeling ones and then a high level one. Brian, given the variability in kind of some of the line items on the cash flow statement, on a quarterly basis. It would be helpful just to better understand kind of where you guys are thinking of landing for free cash flow for the fourth quarter? And then also, understanding a little bit more about the impact to maintenance revenue for next year and consequently, kind of how you're thinking about next year from a cash flow growth standpoint, assuming, of course, that the margin step-down is about 100 to 150 basis points from where we would end this year?
Brian Miller: Yeah. And again, we're not giving 2023 guidance yet. We've had more work around the revenue side than on the other side that we're not really in a position to talk about other than we do expect further compression about the extent of that next year on the margin perspective. I'd say next year, on maintenance, we'd expect that to be down probably low single digits based on the normal increases, the shift in new business more towards the cloud and then the lower level of licenses both this year of new licenses, both this year and next year. But I think it's still probably a low single-digit decline. The cash flow, yeah, I'd say probably our expectations for this year have ticked down a bit around that timing. We do believe that a lot of these timing changes that impacted this quarter versus the same quarter last year, turnaround in the fourth quarter. For example, at crude payroll, we had an extra payroll that ran through cash this quarter compared to last year. I think that turns around in Q4, but payroll for us today is close to $30 million. So that's shift from what we see in Q3 to what we see in Q4. Last year, some of the timing of NIC revenues, the flow of cash around their portals caused a bigger -- shift from Q2 last year to Q3 of last year. So it skews the comparison for this year a bit. And so I think probably our expectation has come down a bit, but a lot of this lightness in Q3 moves the other way into Q4. And as we said on the tax side, and with the change in our tax rate, that's not just a book tax rate, those are also cash taxes. And so we expect to have lower cash tax payments, actually no federal tax payment in Q4 and much lighter tax payments next year as well. And I'd say the overall mix on revenues and margins for next year, probably -- net-net, we probably come out pretty similar to this year's cash flow with maybe our increase is a bit less than we previously expected, but we still expect cash flow to grow. And part of that also, of course, interest will be significantly lower next year as a result of the debt payments we've made this year.
Alex Zukin: Understood. And then maybe just -- and sorry, are you saying the cash flow margin for next year is going to be similar to this year, or the cash flow growth, or the dollar cash flow for next year?
Brian Miller: Cash flow margin would be similar.
Alex Zukin: Got it. Okay. And then, I guess, when you're looking at the acquisition you guys made, can you maybe just talk on where -- what were the incremental functionality or features that you guys saw an opportunity to add and double down on here that you didn't have or NIC didn't have. And if you think about the general M&A landscape, should we expect more in payments? Should we expect less in payments going forward? Do you have what you need here now?
A – Lynn Moore: Yes. Thanks, Alex. I'm glad you asked that question. Because we're pretty excited about this acquisition. As you know, we view payments as really a significant long-term growth driver. And just a little history, remember, we were already in payments. We made the NIC acquisition, because they were the leader in public sector payments. But really, our expertise was on the acquiring side of payments. We had on our road map to get more involved on really the issuing side, generating the payouts. And we actually believe the issuing side of payments is about -- the TAM is about the same size as the acquiring side. When you talk about issuing side of payments, you monetize it by things like transaction load fees, there's interchange revenue, there's account fees. And Rapid was already currently in courts and corrections on the issuing side. That's -- again, that's an area we did not have expertise in, but something that we would have tried to build out sometime over time. But our focus still was on the acquiring side. We think in the near-term, we can -- we've already proven it, because they were a partner of VendEngine that we can in the near term, expand that presence in courts and corrections given our footprint. But then as we look across our Tyler portfolio and market presence, we see a lot of opportunities – other opportunities in the Justice space where it's Juror payments or in make work release or things like that on the state side, unemployment, unclaimed property, tax refunds, parks and outdoor, enterprise, federal, social services. There's all kinds of avenues that, I think we can build this out across our portfolio of existing products.  Caution is always, as we do acquisitions, they take time, but bringing in that expertise is something that gives us the full end-to-end cycle with respect to payments that we didn't have before and so, we're pretty excited about this opportunity. Obviously, we've got a lot of work ahead of us, a lot to go execute on, but it really rounds us out in the complete cycle where I don't think anybody else has the ability to play in that cycle.
Brian Miller: And the only thing I'd add there is on the issuing side versus the acquiring side of the processing side, the margins are better. So that's also a positive.
Alex Zukin: Perfect. Thank you guys. Congrats on a good quarter.
Operator: Your next question is from Charles Strauzer of CJS Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. 
Charles Strauzer: Hi, good morning. Just a quick circle back on the staffing topic. When you look at the – I know, Brian, you talked about turnover moderating and our finding a little bit easier to find headcount. Are you seeing any moderation to on the wage inflation?
Brian Miller: Yes, Charlie, it's -- look, we say we have a little moderation. There is a little moderation. But we're – the labor challenges out there are real and they're present and it's not just us. Now historically, our turnover rates have been lower than others in the tech industry and we track that. We look at turnover, and we're down probably from Q1, our turnover is down about 10% from where it was in Q1, but it's still quite elevated from our historic levels. There are continuous pressures on wages. We're trying to address that where we can, but the labor market is tough right now. And we're trying to keep our people. We've got really good benefits. We've got a really good culture. People love to come to work here. Generally, we have pretty high engagement. We do internal surveys around that. but it's just a difficult market right now and we're trying to address it the best we can.
Charles Strauzer: Great. And also just a quick question, kind of picking up back on the pipeline. I know that it's very robust right now. And you're seeing excellent activity, but are you hearing any trepidation from your clients at all about -- with all the recession talk?
Lynn Moore: We haven't seen it. And we just came out of our quarterly management meetings last week. And obviously, that was a question I asked each of our managers. And right now, we're just not seeing it. And we have to remember that, even though we've got what I call choppy waters out there in the economic world, our clients' budgets are still real healthy and they've been healthy for some time, and that's excluding any ARPA funding or things like that. So right now, we're not seeing it. It's something we continue to ask and probe into, but we're not seeing it right now.
Charles Strauzer: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question is from Saket Kalia of Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Saket Kalia: Okay. Great. Hey guys thanks for taking my questions here. Brian, maybe I'll start with you. I was curious if you could talk a little bit about how bookings did versus your expectations. Great to see the SaaS mix go over 90%. Maybe a little curious how the denominator in that equation did and whether we stay at that 90% mix in future quarters?
Brian Miller: I don't think we stay at the 90% mix, at least near-term in future quarters that was skewed by the Department of State contract, we talked about...
Lynn Moore: 90% of the value.
Brian Miller: 90% of the value. In terms of the number of deals, it was 74% subscription and 26% on-prem, which is -- I'm sorry…
Lynn Moore: 78%.
Brian Miller: Yeah. 78%. And -- so I don't think we stay at 90% of the value because it was a bit skewed by that $54 million deal in -- with the Department of State. The total value, though, really grew nicely. So the highest -- it grew sequentially from last quarter from $126 million to $145 million. It's double what the first quarter total contract value was. So net-net, we feel really good about it. The comparison to last end and we feel good about the continued trend towards more, more cloud in the new bookings. The comparison, as we said, was very difficult, because we had a big -- well, in overall bookings last year, it wasn't software booking, but the e-filing in Illinois was a $63 million value. The -- and then, of course, the COVID revenues flow through bookings and the reduction there affected it as well. But that was certainly expected. So I'd say in an overall sense, probably the number of contracts and the value of those contracts was a bit higher than we expected coming into the quarter and skewed a bit by the Department of State deal.
Saket Kalia: Got it. Got it. That makes a lot of sense. Lynn, maybe just a higher level question on this topic, in your prepared remarks, clearly this year, you and the team have made changes to encourage SaaS adoption, whether it was sales incentives or end of life-ing some perpetual SKUs. To the extent that you can -- are there any levers that you can talk about that the team can maybe pull or sort of tweak next year to continue that momentum.
Lynn Moore: Well, I think we've already got those levers in place as it relates to the new business market. There's, other levers around flips. Those obviously come with added expense. We're still, again, early in our or planning for 2023 and what we're going to target for flips. But I would say that's probably an additional lever. But on the new business market, the things that we've done with product, as you said, the announcements we've made to clients, the things we're doing around sales they're all working in that direction. And part of it, too, is going back is we're taking a very solid, but traditional Tyler deliberate approach to this. And some of this has been around timing of when some of the products have been more cloud efficient ready to be pulling those levers.
Saket Kalia: Very helpful. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Your next question is from Terry Tillman of Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. 
Terry Tillman: Yeah. Thanks for fitting me in as well and taking my questions. I guess, the first question is, we've got some research that we've been gathering in terms of the federal business and some really interesting incremental opportunities for you going forward. It was good to see this deal -- this large deal in the quarter. What can you say about what's going on in the federal side, whether it's case management with Entellitrak or other areas, do you feel like there's an inflection point and potentially a step-up in federal business? And then I had a follow-up.
Lynn Moore: Yes, that's a great question, Terry. I'm actually very encouraged with what I'm seeing in our federal business. The number of deals that we were chasing this year over last year, the size of the deals that we were chasing this year over last year. And I'm highlighting mostly Q3, although, it's things spill over into Q4. The opportunities have grown, the deal size has grown. We've got an excellent sales staff that does -- just does a fabulous job out there. And I'm bullish on where they're going in the future.
Terry Tillman: That's great. And maybe just a follow-up for you or Brian. As we think into 2023 and really over a multiyear period, how do we think about the mix of SaaS and transaction revenue in that subscription line item? I know there's some noise still that we have to grapple with COVID-related maybe transactional revenue. But just in 2023 and beyond, do you see a market shift between those two line items? And what would be the gross margin implications, if any? Thank you.
Brian Miller: Well, at a really high level, taking out the short-term impact of next year, there being none of the COVID-related revenues in there. And this year, there being a significant amount. Generally, we would expect to see really good growth there, mostly around the payment side. We believe that over time, the portal revenues will continue to trend upward as more and more citizens look to do more things digitally with government that they used to do through another channel in person or through the mail and that governments look to be able to provide more of those services digitally to citizens. But I think the big growth there, we've talked about, we expect to continue to see our payments business grow meaningfully through things like with the Rapid acquisition, getting more into the dispersing side and driving the NIC payments platform that's currently primarily at the state level down into our local government customers, and we expect to start to see fruits of that next year. In general, the margins on payments are a bit lower, particularly where we have gross contracts. There's a mix of growth in net, but generally, the margins are a bit lower there. But as far as incremental growth opportunities, we do expect to see, if you're looking out, say, over the next five years to seven years, significant growth around the payment side.
Lynn Moore: Yes. I think it's a little early to sort of forecast margins on the transaction side because of what Brian just said on the payments and the arrangements and how these things go. For example, as we announced last quarter, we won the competitive rebid for South Carolina. In the past, that was a gross revenue payment contracts. That's actually shifting to a net revenue. So that will have actually a revenue headwind next year, but it will be a more positive margin headwind. So as we sort of map out our payments future, and figure out exactly where we think we're going to be growing growth side, where we'll be growing debt side, we'll probably be able to give a little better color there.
Terry Tillman: That’s great. Good luck in 4Q. Thank you 
Operator: Your next question is from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. 
Keith Housum: Thanks. Appreciate it. Good morning. Just a follow-up on the Rapid Financial acquisition. Brian, I think you mentioned the margin profile was better. Can you elaborate, was that better than the acquiring side or better than Tyler's general operating margins?
Brian Miller: It's better than the acquiring side. I was just talking about on a relative basis. The dispersing side or the issuing side has better overall margins than acquiring.
Keith Housum: Got you. Got you. And then following up on the Department of State contract, you mentioned you guys going -- you recognized $8 million of that $54 million in backlog. I think over time, we've heard that same comment about other contracts. As you look at some of the contracts like that, I mean, one, is that true? And then two, how is that growing over time in terms of the contracts are signed that you just can't recognize all of that in the backlog?
Brian Miller: It's pretty rare. It's not in a lot of contracts. We've seen it in -- I think we've had a similar thing with e-filing contracts if they weren't -- we would have a multiyear contract, but if they weren't a fixed fee, there were times we couldn't put the whole contract in value in there, are occasionally, but I'd say it's a handful of times within a year and generally not on contracts of this size, but we fully expect that the Department of State will fully utilize this contract. They're already in existing clients. So this represents a big expansion from what we've already done for them. And we have a multiyear relationship with them already. So we certainly don't expect that the termination for convenience, provisions would come into play. But from an accounting perspective, they do govern how we can recognize in backlog. .
Keith Housum: Great. Thanks. Appreciate it.
Operator: Your last question is from Joe Goodwin of JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. 
Joe Goodwin: Great. Thank you for taking my question. Is there any update on the NIC contract with the IRS that was those put on pause about a year ago?
Lynn Moore: Yes. We did the -- well, there's no meaningful update that we submitted our rebid. We're expecting the IRS to award I think sometime in the next month or so, we're fully expecting to get that award. But there's no material update that I'm aware. Brian?
Brian Miller: No. The expected notification in the fourth quarter, but..
Lynn Moore: Fortunately not happened yet.
Brian Miller: And that, that would be for a start in -- at the beginning of 2024. So that would be a full year ramp up and set up from the time the award takes place until the revenues would actually start.
Joe Goodwin: Understood. Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to Lynn Moore for closing remarks.
Lynn Moore: Great. Thanks, Carol, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to myself or Brian Miller. Thanks, everybody. Have a good day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-28 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to today's Tyler Technologies Second Quarter 2022 Conference Call. Your host for today's call is Lynn Moore, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, July 28, 2022. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Moore. Sir, please go ahead.
Lynn Moore: Thank you, Chris, and welcome to our call. With me today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like for Brian to give the safe harbor statement. Next, I'll have some comments on our quarter, and then Brian will review the details of our results. I'll end with some additional comments, and then we'll take questions. Brian?

Lynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. We're pleased with our second quarter results as the public sector market environment remains strong and RFP and demo activities continue to trend positively. We leveraged successful multi-suite wins and cross-selling efforts to deliver a solid quarter, and our strong competitive position, coupled with an active public sector market, drove a 21% increase in bookings. Overall, we see the challenging broader macro environment as an opportunity to support our clients by replacing aging mission-critical systems and adding advanced digital services to serve the public more efficiently. Total revenues grew approximately 16% with organic growth of 6.2%. Services revenues were flat on an organic basis, exhibiting some softness due to labor market challenges affecting our hiring of implementation resources. Recurring revenues comprised 79.5% of our quarterly revenues and were led by 28% growth in subscription revenues. On an organic basis, excluding COVID-related revenues, subscription revenues grew 14%, reflecting both our accelerating shift to the cloud and growth in transaction-based revenues. We have now achieved greater than 20% subscription revenue growth in 58 of the last 66 quarters. We achieved solid revenue growth even as the shift in new software contract mix accelerates to SaaS from licenses. In Q2, 74% of our new software contract value was SaaS compared to 65% in Q2 last year. As expected, margins compressed, reflecting the increase in our SaaS new business mix and the associated decline in license revenues as well as costs related to the cloud transition. Along with bookings performance, cash flow was a high point of the quarter as both cash flows from operations and free cash flow achieved new highs for a second quarter. April 21 marked the first anniversary of our NIC acquisition, and we continue to be excited about their performance and the growing pipeline of joint opportunities for both Tyler and NIC. NIC's core organic revenue growth was 8%. During the second quarter, we successfully extended our enterprise contracts in West Virginia, Vermont, Kansas and Kentucky. NIC also signed our largest ARR contract for the quarter, a new four-year arrangement with the state of New Jersey for digital motor vehicle titling solution, which we estimate will generate transaction-based revenues of approximately $5 million per year. In addition, NIC signed a new SaaS agreement for our cannabis solution with the states of Alabama and Illinois, which are both state enterprise clients. We continue to build momentum with our joint and cross-sell opportunities with NIC. Our active cross-sell pipeline doubled in value from Q1, and we closed three new deals with NIC clients, including the state of Utah for our Entellitrak Veterans Benefit System and the state of Kentucky for our VendEngine Resident Resources Solution. In other Tyler divisions, we signed four additional notable SaaS deals, each for different product suites and each with a total contract value greater than $3.8 million. Those include Maricopa County, Arizona, for our enterprise permitting and licensing solution; Lancaster, California for our enterprise ERP solution; Lima, Ohio for our enterprise justice and supervision solutions as well as our full suite of public safety applications; and Orange County, Florida for our enterprise assessment and tax solution. In addition, we signed six SaaS deals in the quarter with contract values between $2 million and $3 million each and 14 SaaS deals with contract values between $1 million and $2 million each. During the second quarter, we also amended our e-filing agreement with the state of Washington from a transaction-based volume arrangement to a fixed fee contract. The deal spans nine years for approximately $27 million. However, due to certain contract terms, the majority of this contract was not included in backlog or bookings this quarter. The deal adds approximately $2.8 million in ARR, expanding to over $3 million in ARR in the latter half of the agreement. Our largest new software contract in the quarter was a license deal with Montreal, Quebec for our enterprise assessment and tax solution valued at approximately $13 million. We also signed a second deal in Canada for the same solution with the Yukon territory worth approximately $2 million. In addition, we signed a significant license deal with Dallas County, Texas for our enterprise correction solution valued at approximately $4.5 million. Dallas County, which currently uses our enterprise case management solution, has the ninth largest jail system in the U.S., making it our largest jail client. Other significant license arrangements signed in the quarter, each with a total contract value of greater than $1 million include Charlotte County, Florida and Huntington Park, California for enterprise ERP solution; Fort Worth, Texas for our enforcement mobile solution; and Owasso, Oklahoma for our enterprise public safety, enforcement mobile and data and insight solutions. Now I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our annual guidance for 2022.
Brian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2022. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financial Reports tab, schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. Both GAAP and non-GAAP revenues for the quarter were $468.7 million, up 16%, including NIC and our other acquisitions from the last 12 months. Organic revenue growth, excluding COVID-related revenues was 6.2% on a GAAP basis and 5.8% on a non-GAAP basis. NIC's COVID-related revenues for the quarter exceeded our expectations at $15.2 million. Revenues from the TourHealth initiatives concluded in the second quarter and the Virginia rent relief program is expected to be completed in the third quarter with about $8 million of revenues anticipated in the quarter. As expected, license revenues declined 14.7% as our new software contract mix continued to shift to SaaS. Software revenues rose 18.3% -- service revenues rose 18.3% but on an organic basis were essentially flat with last year. Services revenues were impacted by delays in hiring new professional services staff in the current labor market. While we hired a large class of implementers during the quarter, there is an onboarding period of several months before they will be fully billable. We intend to continue to grow our implementation team during the second half of the year to support delivery of our growing backlog and pipeline, but we'll likely continue to see some pressure on services revenues in the short term as those teams ramp up. Subscription revenues rose 28.2% with strong organic growth of 14.1%. We added 167 new subscription-based arrangements and converted a new high of 96 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $115 million in total contract value. In Q2 of last year, we added 170 new subscription-based arrangements and had 62 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $73 million in total contract value. Our software subscription bookings in the second quarter added $27.6 million in new ARR. Subscription contract value comprised approximately 74% of the total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 65% in Q2 of last year. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 3.7 years compared to 4.1 years last year. Transaction-based revenues, which include NIC portal, payment processing and e-filing revenues and are included in subscriptions, were $154.4 million, up 29.1%. Excluding NIC, Tyler's transaction-based revenues grew 17.5%. E-filing revenues reached a new high of $18.5 million, up 14%. For the second quarter, our non-GAAP ARR was approximately $1.49 billion, up 16.3%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS software arrangements was approximately $405.6 million, up 24.9%. Transaction-based ARR was approximately $617.7 million, up 29.1% and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was down 2.3% at approximately $467.3 million due to the continued migration of on-premises clients to the cloud. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was a new high of $1.85 billion, up 13.9%. Bookings in the quarter were very strong at approximately $562 million, up 21%, including transaction-based revenues. On an organic basis, bookings were also quite robust at approximately $423 million, up 16.3%. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $2 billion, up 53.2% on an organic basis were approximately $1.5 billion up 21.1%. If our weighted average contract terms for new SaaS contracts had been the same as last year, organic bookings growth would have been 18.3%. As Lynn mentioned earlier, both cash flows from operations and free cash flow reached new highs for a second quarter. Cash flows from operations were $76.7 million and free cash flow rose to $60 million from negative $33.5 million last year. We continue to strengthen our already solid balance sheet. During the quarter, we repaid $60 million of our term debt. And since completing the NIC acquisition, we have paid down $475 million of term debt. We will also pay down an additional $100 million in term debt at the end of this month. We ended the quarter with total outstanding debt of $1.275 billion and cash and investments of $314 million. As a reminder, $600 million of our debt is in the form of convertible debt with an interest rate of 0.25% and the remainder is in prepayable term debt due in 2024 and 2026. We also have an undrawn $500 million revolver. Our net leverage at June 30 was approximately 2.07x trailing 12 months pro forma EBITDA and our leverage should be under 2x at the end of July. Interest rate hikes thus far this year and projected for the remainder of the year have resulted in significantly higher projected interest expense for the year than we anticipated at the beginning of the year. In addition, we have debt discounts and issuance costs related to our term debt that are being amortized as noncash interest expense. And as we prepay term debt, we are required to accelerate the amortization of those costs. Accordingly, we have adjusted our earnings guidance for the full year to reflect those changes in assumptions around interest. Our current guidance for the full year interest expense of $30 million represents an increase of about $7 million or approximately $0.12 per share for both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS compared to our previous guidance. The $7 million increase includes about $4 million of cash interest on term debt and $3 million of additional noncash amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs. It's important to note that our revenue guidance has not changed, and our expectations for operating margins are generally consistent with our previous outlook. Our updated 2022 guidance is as follows. We expect both GAAP and non-GAAP total revenues will be between $1.835 billion and $1.870 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 9%. We expect total revenues will include approximately $44 million of COVID-related revenues from NIC's TourHealth and pandemic rent relief services. Revenues from TourHealth concluded in the second quarter, while revenues from the rent relief program are expected to wind down in the third quarter. We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be between $3.60 and $3.76 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $7.36 and $7.52. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $30 million, including approximately $7.5 million of noncash amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn.
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. Against the backdrop of generally strong public sector budgets supplemented by federal stimulus funds, we're experiencing a very active market. With our leading competitive position and ongoing investments in strategic initiatives, we are well positioned to take advantage of the continued strength in our market. The acquisitions we've made over the last 18 months, including NIC, VendEngine and US eDirect, are performing well and contributing to our strong competitive position, helping us create more cross-sell and upsell opportunities with both new and existing clients. In particular, our enthusiasm around the cross-sell opportunities through NIC continues to grow, with recent wins across multiple Tyler products and a rapidly growing pipeline of opportunities. We're also pleased with our progress around our combined payments business. as we begin to execute our go-to-market strategy to pursue a tremendous public sector payments TAM. We believe Tyler is uniquely qualified to deliver government-focused payment solutions, leveraging the strength of NIC's payment platform, analytics and reporting and deep domain expertise together with Tyler's broad software portfolio and extensive client base, and we look forward to reporting our progress in the coming quarters. Even as we face an uncertain economic macro environment with rising inflation and interest rates, we have a great deal of confidence in our ability to continue to generate solid financial results and to grow cash flow. There are a number of factors that make Tyler's business resilient and relatively defensive compared to many software peers. The public sector market is more stable than many segments of the private sector. We provide solutions that power essential government services often replacing mission-critical systems that are end of life, and our clients don't go out of business or get acquired. Recurring revenues comprised approximately 80% and growing of our total revenues, generating highly reliable cash flow. In addition, the public sector is increasingly focused on moving into the cloud, which we support with our cloud-first model. Our experience during the recession more than a decade ago supports our confidence and Tyler is clearly in a much stronger position today to succeed during an economic downturn. We also have the advantage of a very strong balance sheet and reliable cash flow, which enables us to continue to invest strategically in growth even if some competitors may be constrained. While we have term and convertible debt associated with the NIC acquisition and have been impacted by rising interest rates, we are modestly leveraged at approximately 2x adjusted EBITDA, and we expect to continue to delever. Accordingly, in the near term, we are prioritizing using our cash flow to reduce debt while retaining the flexibility to pursue strategic acquisitions and investments that provide long-term value. Finally, I'm happy to report that we remain on track with our major strategic initiatives, including projects related to optimizing our products for efficient deployment of the cloud, moving from our proprietary data centers to AWS, and ultimately accelerating the migration of our on-premise clients to the cloud and driving long-term margin expansion. With that, we'd like to open the line for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Sami Badri: First, I just wanted to ask about the sales cycle that you guys -- sorry, going back, looking at the larger deals that you guys announced, there were several this quarter. What was the sales cycle for these? Are sales cycles tightening, elongating? Are they in line with prior length? Any color on that? And then the second kind of question tied to that is we are seeing a strengthening state and local budget spend environment. And I think one question we do get from a lot of investors is how do you connect those revisions in those state and local budgets? And how do those end up making their way into companies, right, like yourselves? Could you kind of give us an idea from what you guys see in the field from the date budgets are announced to the date that they're actually translated into actual bookings or revenues on your side?
Lynn Moore: Yes, sure, Sami, it's Lynn. I'll start and I'll let Brian jump in. I think right now, our sales cycles are pretty normal. I think we've experienced times if you go back to the recession in '08, '09, that's where you started seeing things push out and get delayed. We saw a little bit of that during COVID. But I think the key is we continually talk about the fact that what we provide is essential functionality and the software that we do provide are things that are needed and they're often replacing out of date or systems. And so right now, the market looks good. The sales cycles are pretty typical for a normal healthy time, even with respect to those large deals. Sales cycles will vary a little bit across our different divisions. Some have longer than others. And sometimes the larger deals do take a little bit longer. But I think across the board, across our different product suites, I'd say sales cycles are pretty much on track. When you talk about state and local government spending environment, what we're seeing right now really is it's pretty healthy. I agree their budgets are in good shape. I've made comments before that I think coming out of COVID, they were not hit nearly as hard as a lot of people anticipated some of the journal reports and other things that we've read. Also with the infusion of some stimulus. And I know Brian's got some numbers and thoughts around ARPA. But I think right now, what we're seeing in our pipeline, all our leading indicators around RFPs and demos, things like that, you're seeing it a little bit in some of our bookings this quarter is that things are well right now in the state and local government.
Brian Miller: And I'd just add a couple of things. Clearly, on the larger contracts, typically do have a longer sales cycle and some of these very large ones, sales cycles can be sometimes measured in years from the time we start talking to someone about a solution and the timing of when those actually show up in a signed contract can be somewhat unpredictable. And I'd say that's the case with a couple of these larger deals, the Montreal deal and the Dallas deal that we talked about, both had pretty long cycles, but we're pretty persistent. In terms of the timing of how something makes it into the bookings, that can also vary quite a bit. Some jurisdictions will start the process of acquiring a solution before they have it budgeted, knowing that it's a mission-critical solution and replacing it is somewhat nondiscretionary. So they may start the sales process or the buying process well in advance of that actually showing up in a budget and be prepared then when it's funded to sign a contract and move forward pretty quickly. Others may get it in a budget and then start a process or really accelerate a process. So it can take place in a variety of ways, but -- so the fact that new budgets are rising doesn't immediately result in sort of a flood of new pipeline activity that don't always perfectly match up.
Operator: Next question is from Matthew VanVliet with BTIG. Your line is open.
Matthew VanVliet: You mentioned on the professional services side and overall implementation. You were a little bit limited both from a headcount perspective and the ability to hire new headcount to add to that. Just curious in terms of how that's progressing, both through July and what expectations, how those have changed through the end of the year? And then secondarily, has this increased your appetite to look to external partners to help with some of at least the more straightforward implementations or some of the more blocking tackling components of the deployments?
Lynn Moore: Sure. Thanks, Matthew. And I guess I would just say that the labor market challenges that are out there, we talk about a lot of things in our business where we may be a little bit immune to some of the external macro factors. But the challenges in the labor market, we're not unique there. And so we've been experiencing this for some time. It has been a challenge, both in terms of hiring and recruiting, and we're also seeing it with a little bit higher early retirements and things like that. The impact is -- we're seeing it right now, and we've got a lot of business we want to execute on and deliver on, but our services revenues are off a little bit. And I'd probably expect some of that to carry through throughout the year. We do generally make sort of large hiring classes. You take, for example, our enterprise ERP group. They hired a very large class back in February. I think we're looking at hiring another very large class in the next few weeks. But even when you hire those large classes, it takes time for them to get up to speed and get to a point where they can go out and become fully billable on client implementation. So it can take four, five, six months. So there's a little bit of delay there. So there's a little bit of impact that will happen even as our margins as we bring these people on, but it takes a little time for them to start becoming billable. As it relates to external partners, I think historically, we've always wanted to keep our services in-house. It's certainly not a big margin advantage to have them in-house, but we think from a professional and competitive and client ownership advantage, it really has been -- has played out and been a lot of value to us really for the last 25 years. The thought of always having the touch point from initially from our sales, handing it off to our implementation team, handing it off to our support team, I think that client relationship and client experience is part of what drives our success in the market. And so as of right now, we're not really looking to do that. It's such a unique business that I think we just want to keep these things in-house, at least for the time being.
Matthew VanVliet: Very, very helpful. And then as you look at the state hunting license agreements that NIC has in place, how do you feel you're progressing in terms of getting through any demand associated with those customers, making your way into, I guess, sort of the local level that roll up through those statewide purchasing agreements. You've captured a lot of the sort of low-hanging fruit that NIC just didn't have the product to sell through. Or are we still very early stages of the overall opportunity that those present for you?
Lynn Moore: Yes, Matthew. I think I made the comment on the last call that we're probably in the first inning of our -- what we can do with NIC and maybe even just the top of the first inning. I wouldn't say that -- they did -- the reality is they didn't really have some of the local relationships. We're still learning about each other. The fact that this soon, we've already done the number of deals that we've done, I think we've closed 15 deals already. Our active pipeline is around 100 deals, north of $30 million. That's pretty exciting in such a short period of time while we're still doing just our normal integrations with NIC. We've won some pretty significant contracts. I think, last quarter, we talked about VendEngine won a contract with the Arkansas Department of Corrections, mentioned in my comments earlier, another VendEngine contract with Kentucky, our Entellitrak Veterans Benefits contract with Utah. That's pretty exciting stuff, particularly with -- when I mentioned a deal between NIC and VendEngine and something I've said internally is these are both acquisitions that we've brought on in the last year and in different parts of the business and to see that coordination already and to be able to leverage the relationships that NIC has got those deep state relationships as well as those enterprise contracts, it's pretty exciting stuff.
Brian Miller: And I'd just add that specifically on hunting and fishing, we're still integrating US eDirect with the NIC outdoor recreation platform, but really a significant increase in our capabilities there. But I'd say we're in the very early stages of being able to drive that down more broadly, both within local government and at the state and federal levels. But that is one of the product areas that on a combined basis, we've got a lot of strength in and that we're looking for big things out of...
Lynn Moore: I apologize, Matthew, if you're asking about hunting, I heard state, we call those understanding.
Matthew VanVliet: No, I was talking about the NIC deals, those agreements. But thanks for the extra color, Brian. Appreciated guys.
Operator: The next question is from Saket Kalia with Barclays. Your line is open.
Saket Kalia: Okay. Great. Lynn, maybe just for you. Can you just talk a little bit about what product areas are having the most success in converting maintenance customers to SaaS? I know there were a lot more -- there was a lot more in TCV converted this year than -- or this quarter versus last -- Q2 of last year. Where do you feel like you're having that success? And then related to that, how do you think about that base moving over to SaaS in the coming years?
Lynn Moore: Yes, sure, Saket. Thanks for the question. It's a good question. I think right now, probably the primary areas where we're seeing the most flips is in our ERP side of the -- suite of the business. So both our enterprise ERP and our ERP Pro solutions. We had -- and coincidentally, those are the areas where we actually have the most customers. That's our largest customer base. I think at our top end, our enterprise ERP, we're already well ahead of our plan for the year in flips. We're about 35% ahead through the first half. The lower end in our ERP Pro solution, which is our formerly our Incode solution, we plan to do about 180 a year down in that product suite. We're obviously seeing it in other businesses, but that's probably our highest volume. And as we continue to move forward, you're going to see that increase not only there, but across all of our product suites. As we model out and look forward, we're starting to do some internal modeling around what we call Tyler 2030. And a big part of our growth strategy is converting that very high customer base from on-prem over into the SaaS world. I'm not prepared today to sort of give you a projection of how many per year and how much that's going to grow. But I would expect over the next five to seven years, you're going to continue to see momentum and increased movement in that area.
Saket Kalia: Got it. That makes sense. Brian, maybe for you as a follow-up. And maybe this is related to some of the hiring commentary that you folks had mentioned on services. But can you just talk a little bit about software and services bookings? It's been a couple of strong quarters of bookings, strong on bookings than done on revenue, frankly. So can you just talk about what's driving that strength? And just maybe anything different this year about the conversion to revenue here versus prior years?
Brian Miller: Well, I think on the second part of the question, the conversion to revenue is just that more of it is SaaS or -- and so you don't necessarily get a revenue hit. In fact, you typically don't get a revenue hit immediately. Often, it's a quarter or two after the signing before their environment stood up and we start to recognize revenues. So even with the SaaS customer, there's a lag. And then, of course, you've got a recurring revenue stream that you're starting to grow. So it may start in the third month of the quarter and so you get a month's worth of revenues, and the next quarter you get a quarter's worth and so forth. And so that ongoing change in the mix has been a part of that with less licenses, which are typically recognized mostly upfront. We talked about a little bit of the service pressure as well. So that also is with our -- a little bit below plan headcount there, we're, I think, not ramping up those new signings as quickly as we might once we're sort of fully staffed with our billable implementation teams. So I think that's the biggest thing. I think in terms of just driving higher bookings, we've always said bookings can be somewhat lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, especially around those big deals. In this quarter, a couple of those big deals that did have long sales cycles got to contract. But generally, I'd say it's sort of a combination of those factors we pointed out, pretty strong economic backdrop in budget situation around governments. It's certainly aided by the ARPA funds, the federal stimulus that's available to them. As we've talked about on prior calls, sometimes it's not clearly identifiable that a deal was funded with ARPA funds. Sometimes it is, and there are some of those in this quarter. Other times ARPA funds are used for something else, but it frees up money that helps perhaps make an incremental purchase or an add-on sales. We're seeing real strength in our inside sales selling additional products to existing customers, and we believe some of that is driven by the federal stimulus. But as we've said in the past, that's sort of a long-term tailwind they've got until the end of 2024 really to commit those funds and through 2026 to spend those. And we saw a study by Brookings that indicated that at least as of the end of 2021, only about 40% of the stimulus funds had been committed yet by cities and counties. So we think there's sort of an ongoing tailwind there. So strength in the market and then our competitive position is really strong. I mean, we continue to invest at a high level. We've got multiple products that we've added through acquisitions and internal builds. So our average sales are often bigger than they would have been in the past because we've got more products that are bundled together, things like our data and insight solution that's often bundled in a new sale, a number of our public safety products that now are often in a new sale that make that bigger. So there are a number of factors contributing to that. But yes, there is typically a lag from bookings growth to revenue growth.
Operator: The next question is from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
Michael Turrin: There were several comments throughout the prepared remarks around the strength and resilience of the demand environment. Just wondering if there's any more color you can add around what you're seeing from public sector customers currently and how the RFP volumes you're referencing compare to what you're used to generally seeing this time of the year?
Lynn Moore: Yes, sure, Michael. I mean it's -- the last few years have been a little bit rocky with COVID and everything else. What we're seeing right now is really a return to pre-COVID levels generally across the board. Our RFPs are up, our demos are up and I'd say the market looks pretty strong. In some parts of our business, the pipeline is growing even beyond those levels. In some parts, it's sort of returned back to sort of pre-COVID levels. So right now, what we're seeing out there in the market, all the leading indicators is budgets are strong and healthy and the demand is there.
Michael Turrin: That's helpful. Brian, you provided us with a lot of useful detail around segmentation and various splits of the business. In terms of where your focus lies, can you help level set what you view as the True North metric for top line or a couple of metrics as you're working through the transition? Is it backlog, the SaaS ARR metric or something else, I think it would be useful to hear you talk through just given the moving pieces of the model and the macro we're all working through here?
Brian Miller: Yes. We recognize that our business is maybe a little bit more complicated given the transition from license to the cloud and the addition of NIC and their transaction-based revenue streams and our plans to grow what already is a pretty sizable payments business through NIC to grow that significantly. So we give a lot of metrics and we recognize you probably give too many metrics. But I'd say, if you're looking for kind of the North Star and what's really important is our model evolves, it would be those metrics around ARR and particularly, we do get the breakdown of those different components of ARR, but particularly software subscription ARR and transaction ARR. And we expect that maintenance will kind of flat right now, will start to decline as more of those customers flip to the cloud. So really, the things that probably the most important metric would be around those recurring ARs from subscriptions and transactions.
Operator: The next question is from Joshua Reilly with Needham. Your line is open.
Joshua Reilly: How should we think about the seasonality, if any, around the payments business now, including NIC, both from the portal revenues from core Tyler and NIC?
Brian Miller: Yes. Typically, the fourth quarter is lighter there, less activity through the portals, less maybe slightly less in terms of payment volumes that are often associated with those portal transactions. So around the holidays and as people get to the end of the year, there's just a little bit lower activity there. The other thing that we talked about last quarter which is sort of new to us is in the Florida contract with the revenues around the payments for the Department of State and their corporate licensing activity, which is almost all in the first quarter, a little bit of it lags into the second quarter. And I think they were around $6 million of revenues associated with that that's seasonally towards the beginning of the year. But other than that, it's primarily a fourth quarter slowdown around the payments.
Joshua Reilly: That's helpful.
Lynn Moore: I think too, Josh, was as we continue to grow that payments business and we were -- as you know, we're already growing it within Tyler and as you extend it beyond just some of the NIC things around outdoor activities and stuff. As we look out several years, I think you'll see that as the volume gets bigger and it's across a larger base and it's across using more products and more constituents, you'll see that, I think, over time, flatten out, but that will take some time.
Joshua Reilly: Got it. And then just one other follow-up on the NIC business. What are you seeing in terms of the driver history record hold revenue that was from that segment? Is that recovering as you would have expected? And how much could that potentially positively impact revenue throughout the rest of the year?
Lynn Moore: Yes, I'd say the DHR right now, it's kind of on our internal plan for the year, which is really essentially sort of flat with very little growth. And I think that's one of the areas in our business when we talk about being recession resistant. It's an area where I think we're seeing a little bit of impact in the DHR business. At the same time, DHR used to be -- if you go back several years, it was a very big substantial piece of the NIC businesses as we're starting to grow these other streams. I'm expecting the impact of DHR and the percentage of that business to somewhat decrease within that business unit. I think right now, it's about 17% of their total revenues, maybe 19% outside of COVID, and I think that's trending towards maybe down in the 15% range as we're starting to grow some of these other state interactive government services revenues, payments revenues and some more products going through their systems.
Brian Miller: Yes. So typically, this quarter, they were down about 2%. So they're recovering a bit, but still softness there. And that's one also that we believe is affected indirectly by supply chain and some of that's tied to new vehicle sales. And those are a broader economy. There's no cars out there.
Operator: The next question is from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Kirk Materne: Congrats on a really nice bookings quarter. Lynn, I was wondering could you just talk a little bit about what's your discussions like with customers today in terms of consolidating the number of vendors they're working with. I was just kind of curious you all obviously have a much more expansive product portfolio than you did 10 years ago. How much is the ability to sort of take wallet share a bigger part of the story today than it was say, 5, 10 years ago? And is that accelerating? Is that conversation accelerating? I'm just sort of wondering about thinking about you all more in sort of a net revenue retention basis, meaning the ability to expand sort of cross and upsell versus just be as reliant as you were on sort of net new, say, again, 5, 10 years ago?
Lynn Moore: Yes, sure, Kirk. Good question. I think part of our strategy has always been to have a comprehensive suite and compete that way and sell our products as a suite as opposed to single point solutions. I still think that's a significant competitive advantage. There are some consultants and things out there that are sometimes suggesting to go the other way. I'm not really quite sure why because having to do a bunch of extra integrations, trying to get multiple vendors, just seems to me to be more of a headache rather than going to a single vendor. And you're right. I think one of our help it takes decades to develop. And so when you look at cross-selling and upselling back into that base, that's also a big strategic driver for us going forward. Every quarter, the reports I'm seeing were -- our inside sales channels are continuing to outdo themselves each and every quarter. And as we continue to do tuck-in acquisitions and broaden our portfolio, I think you're going to continue to see that. And I do think it's one of our competitive advantages in the market.
Kirk Materne: And Brian, just on the ramp in sort of your services business and bring out more billable or more headcount on that side. How should we think about that sort of impacting margins as we think a little bit ahead to 23%. I realize you guys are expecting margins maybe start picking up again in '24, not next year. But is there anything we should be aware of, meaning maybe a little bit heavier weight on the first half of the year next year as people get ramped up versus the back half? Any just color on that would be helpful.
Brian Miller: Yes. I think the margin impact is more of what we're seeing this year because you bring those people on, obviously, you're paying them there in your expenses, but it's maybe kind of a six months ramp-up to become fully billable. So initially, you get a margin hit from having the cost without the revenues associated with it. And then so from a negative impact, you will see that more this year. And then as they become billable and they're starting to generate revenues, and help us deliver that backlog, then you see a positive impact. Services aren't a high-margin business for us as it is. But -- so I would expect that as you get into the early part of next year through the middle of next year, you'll start to see a positive impact from those employees being productive. And we hired, as Linda, a pretty big class or classes cumulatively pretty large across Q2 and have pretty strong hiring plans in the second half of the year. So assuming we can execute on those and turnover seems to be settling down a bit. Then we'll have those resources billable in the first part of next year.
Operator: The next question is from Charles Strauzer with CJS Securities. Your line is open.
Charles Strauzer: Just picking up on that last question about the labor hiring looking at the gross margin on a percentage basis in Q2, it was down pretty significantly year-over-year and down a touch sequentially while SG&A was lower. Was that kind of the main driver behind that?
Lynn Moore: Yes. I think the margin, there's a combination of professional services is part of that, as I just described. We're certainly seeing as we talked about as we headed into the year with our guidance, a return of some of the, I'd say, COVID cost savings. Some of those are in the SG&A lines. Some of those are in cost of sales, particularly billable travel. So while we still currently and expect in the future to deliver a significant amount of services remotely as we did during COVID, there is billable travel returning across some segments of our business. And so that's having an impact from margins, which we expected. And then we've talked about some of the transaction cost, the bubble costs associated with our cloud transition and specifically with the move from our proprietary data centers to AWS. And so those things are generally in line with what we expected. We did have also a bit higher revenue stream from the COVID-related revenues at NIC. Those have typically a bit lower margin than Tyler's overall margin. So the sort of over-performance in those revenues had a negative margin impact. And as we've said, we expect those to -- the last of those to go away at the end in the third quarter. So that will be a positive from a margin perspective.
Charles Strauzer: That's helpful. And just staying on the AWS transition there, where do you think you are in terms of the -- your expectations for that transition? And are you tracking ahead behind on schedule, that kind of thing.
Lynn Moore: Yes. I think, Charlie, we're on track with our internal plans, both in terms of where we are with our product investments, what we've outlined for plans to exit our data centers. And when we talk about sort of getting the other side of the bubble costs. So right now, internally, I'm pleased with where we're sitting.
Operator: Next question is from Rob Oliver with Baird. Your line is open.
Rob Oliver: There hasn't been a lot of commentary on public safety on the call. So then I thought I'd ask about that. It was a bit of a focus in Indianapolis. And over the last couple of years, you guys certainly have begun to see some nice success in cross-sell of public safety into your core. So just curious to know how you characterize that market right now? And when you look at the components of that RFP activity and pipeline, how does public safety fare in their win rates and then how it sets up for that sort of all-important back half for the year in Q4?
Lynn Moore: Yes, sure, Rob. I appreciate that comment. I'd say public safety right now, the market has moved back to sort of pretty much back to normal. Our competitive landscape. I like our position. There's a couple of strong competitors. We've talked about them before. We've also know that there's some competitors out there that are in that space that are carrying a lot of debt, which I think are probably with the change in rates might be impacting their ability to execute. We've seen some reports on some smaller competitors who may be going through a little bit more difficult time and seen some layoffs and things like that. But right now, we're pretty pleased with where we sit. We made a big investment years ago into things like mobility. And that continues to be a significant competitive edge for us, along with, as you mentioned, leveraging a lot of these other acquisitions we've done in our Tyler Alliance story. I mentioned in my opening comments, the contract with Lima County, Ohio, which was principally -- we sold our Enterprise Courts & Justice product and some things on the C&J side, but also the public safety side and that Alliance story really resonated with the client. So we're starting to see good things there. The market is still, I think, somewhat resistant to the cloud, but we're starting to get some SaaS deals done. We're looking at potentially getting our first beta client in the AWS Cloud, maybe later this year or early next year. So there's some exciting things going on in that market.
Rob Oliver: Great. Okay. That's really good color. And then, Brian, just a quick one for you, just on the CapEx reduction, and I apologize if I missed it. If you could just talk a little bit about what the components were of that.
Brian Miller: On the CapEx? Nothing really significant. It's just some tweaking of the timing of some of the things, particularly around our -- some of our facilities and NIC, for example, is moving into a new facility in the Kansas City area and the timing of some of those things has just shifted around a bit. So I don't think there's anything early notable in our CapEx right now relative to what we thought at the beginning of the year. A little bit minor changes too in our capitalization around some of our internal software development efforts, most of that being associated with the cloud optimization of some of our products. So sometimes there's a little bit of a difference of how we originally estimated it will fall in how the accounting rules ultimately end up with what we capitalize and what runs through expense.
Operator: The next question is from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Alex Zukin: Just maybe a few for me. It sounds -- a lot of this has been asked, but it sounds like the bookings were really strong this quarter. And particularly, if you adjust for the duration of the contracts, it's even better. What -- if you think about the headwind to SaaS revenues, particularly that you're seeing from that services hiring challenge that you talked about what would it be -- what would -- is it possible to know like where SaaS revenues would be if you didn't have that challenge? And then I've got a few more.
Brian Miller: Yes, I'm not exactly sure how we would translate that. I think the lag in the start is pretty modest, but I think we would be seeing a little bit higher level, but I don't know that it's sort of a double-digit effect. I think it's pretty modest now. And like I said, we have pretty aggressive hiring plans for the rest of the year to get our teams up to full strength. And so I think it's a relatively short-term impact. We'll see how it plays out through the balance of the year. It could create some softness on that services side. But I think at this point, it's not a big impediment to growth in the subscription revenues, but certainly is some sort of a factor there.
Alex Zukin: Got it. And then the other question is, I mean, with all the headlines around inflation and software companies raising price, can you remind us what are kind of the inflation adjustments or pricing vectors that you have in your model with customers. And particularly, I know that annual maintenance upticks are part of that. So as you see more customers converting to SaaS, how do you make sure that you continue to capture those unit economics on the subscription contracts -- on the SaaS contracts.
Lynn Moore: Yes, sure, Alex. So -- and you're right, most of our maintenance contracts are annual agreements. We do have a few multiyear ones. A small percentage of those have built-in escalators, but generally, most of them have the ability to adjust pricing on an annual basis. Some of those are tied to CPI, but I think that's probably not the majority. But there is some flexibility there. And we took a look at that this spring. Still a majority of our maintenance contracts are on the sort of the June 30, July 1 cycle, and it's something that we talked about internally back in March and April before we went out. As it relates to SaaS contracts, similar things. I mean we -- these are -- after you get through the initial engagement, you do have the ability to start putting in price increases. A lot of our initial SaaS deals are multiyear terms. Some of them are they may be built-in escalators, but the way the revenue recognition has worked historically is that we actually have been recognizing them on more of a flat rate. So there can be a little bit of a declining margin. It's one of the reasons why we've tried really hard to shorten the length of those initial contracts, but we're also looking at doing some things with contract terms so that we will be able to get those built-in escalators. We do price them in. So we're getting the cash in those agreements. And then as they roll off and we move into their annual renewals, we'll have the ability to change that pricing even more. But there are obviously some existing agreements that are out there that had pricing that was built in a year or two ago that we're -- we can't adjust at this point.
Brian Miller: And in some of our products, we did implement sort of our above-normal maintenance increases this year. And we've also taken a look at our professional services billing rates and in some cases, adjustments there to account for inflation.
Alex Zukin: Perfect. And then I guess on the topic of cash in the door, if you actually look at your guys' model, every two years, your free cash flow seasonality in the first half jumps around. It goes from like 23% to 24% of the total year to 10% to 12% of the total year. So first of all, just help us understand the -- it looks like we're in one of those years where it could be more like the 20-plus percent year, but I just want to understand the seasonality from a free cash flow perspective as we look at the second half, specifically and the full year? And then just tie that in with capital allocation. You talked about wanting to pay down the debt, which makes perfect sense given the raising interest rate expenses and environment. But also maybe comment given where the stock is, given where the fundamentals are around your -- the possibility of an increased buyback.
Brian Miller: I'll take the first part of that. Yes, the cash flow does -- typically the third quarter, and I think that's every year is the strongest quarter, primarily because of those maintenance billings. We have close to $470 million a year in maintenance. Not all of it, but the biggest chunk of that is renewed as of July 1. They typically build late in the second quarter and collected in the third quarter. Those they are typically don't age. So those are paid relatively promptly. So that drives that third quarter cash flow growth. I think some of -- there was a little bit of an anomaly last year in the second quarter around NIC shortly with -- because they were only in for part of the quarter. And there was some sort of unusual dynamics around the timing just when we acquired them, they happen to have a fair amount of, I guess, what I'd describe as customer cash that's sort of passing through that from their transaction-based revenue streams that was on their balance sheet that then was paid out, remitted on to the customers after acquisition. So it created sort of an anomaly there. This year, it's sort of the normal full quarter and NIC's cash flow is more consistent across the year given the transaction-based nature of most of their revenues. So I think you'll see that start to even out a little bit more. But I still think, yes, you probably see certainly more than half and more in the kind of 2/3 of our cash flow for the year in the second half of the year. But I think there was that sort of unusual situation last year.
Lynn Moore: Yes. And on the second question around use of cash, you're right. Our priority still is debt pay downs. But we're still actively looking at acquisitions. We're not -- it's not like we've closed the door. We're not answering calls. We've been actively looking. We've participated in a couple of processes this year. Obviously, we purchased USD Direct early in the year. But we need something compelling and something that's really at a reasonable valuation. What we've seen in the acquisition front, at least even recently, even as the broader markets have gone through a little bit of turbulence in the last few months. The expectations for some of these private companies has not changed. And in fact, in some cases, has almost exceeded. I mean if people pitch deals where they tell me that I need to be paying higher valuations than Tyler. And that's a little bit hard for me to understand. It's a bit of a head scratcher. Our debt right now is our blended rate is about -- after we make this payment this month. It will be about 2%. But that's really a function of the fact that we've paid so much debt down. when we first took out our debt, I think our convertible was about 34% of our total debt. After this payment this month. It will be more just over 50%. So as we continue to pay our term down, we won't be as impacted by interest rates as we look out over the next year, which is nice. As it relates to share repurchases, I think right now, I agree with you as I look out five years, seven years from now, the stock could look pretty attractive. But I think unless we're really wanting to do a significant move, I'd rather just pay down the debt in the near term.
Operator: The next question is from Terry Tillman with Truist Securities. Your line is open.
Terry Tillman: In Brian, I feel like I should follow the 10 because we're going past an hour, but I can't help myself since I have you, I'm going to ask a couple of questions. First, I do want to use some fringe because of the Montreal deal for Bongor I guess the first question just relates to -- we talked to one court system. They had a 25-year plus old case management system. I know you've talked about your high-end ERP business, your ERP Pro business and then somebody asked about -- Matt asked about public safety. How is case management opportunities right now in terms of how would that stack rank versus some of these other kind of cloud replacement opportunities? And then a quick.
Brian Miller: Case management. Yes. Case Management is one of our most I'd say probably our most dominant products in the marketplace, probably one of our biggest market shares. So our enterprise case management formerly Odyssey is I think north of 55% of the courts in the U.S. use that solution. I think it's 8 of the 10 largest counties in the country something like 17 state-wide implementation. So it's a very strong product for us. But it also can be somewhat of a lumpy business, particularly with respect to those really big contracts because it is not unusual for us to see 20, think we've replaced a couple of 40-plus year old case management systems that were custom written in the 70s in some of these large counties. And so there's sort of some long-term activity in the backdrop. We see more of the kind of mid-range deals that are more currently active in the pipeline, but I don't think there are any big statewide deals that are sort of currently actively in the market. But we do have a very high success rate as those come along. And then as we've been able to build on that really very strong position we have in the case management space, where most of our growth in courts is coming from now is from those products that we have in that suite around it. So we mentioned on the call today, one of our bigger deals, Dallas County. Dallas County has been a long time. It's a top 10 county been a longtime case management customer -- but now we were able to add our jail solution to the products that they use. So building on that relationship, and we've done a number of acquisitions in that space, probation, jury, prosecutor, process service solutions that broaden our offerings there and enable us to grow there. But I'd say it's certainly a solid business, and we still have a very strong competitive position. But right now, not as much new activity. But as it comes along, we're well positioned.
Lynn Moore: Yes. And just to add to that, Jonathan, that last point that Brian said, I think is worth emphasizing. Using -- leveraging our strong position in -- it's still an anchor. It's still the gateway and the ability to take some of these other investments we've done, whether it's around corrections like the Dallas County Jail deal, but even supervision, if you remember a few years ago, I think it was about four years ago, we did an acquisition of a company called CaseloadPRO. And we won this -- we signed this in Q2, L.A. County, for enterprise supervision, supervision. That's pre trial. We talked about the different areas and even in supervision, whether it's juvenile adult and things like that. And we think we're going to be adding those additional solutions to L.A. County, which is the largest coronal justice departments and counties in the United States. So.
Terry Tillman: That's great. Congrats on the quarter.
Operator: The next question is from Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Your line is open.
Jonathan Ho: I'll keep it to one question. With the upcoming quarter, can you remind us of whether there are any large deals in terms of maybe some tougher bookings comparisons? SP1.
Brian Miller: A second. Yes. Last year, in Q3, we didn't really have any mega deals. Our biggest SaaS deal was about a $5 million contract value with Lawrence, Kansas, and we had a handful of license deals, the biggest of which was less than $3 million. So I think it's a pretty normal comp coming up.
Operator: The next question is from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is open.
Keith Housum: I'll keep mine to one question while I know we're running late here. Brian, maybe you just touch on the NIC acquisition, your ability to retain employees over the past year and how that affects the business going forward.
Brian Miller: Yes, it's been really solid, both at the senior management level and the staff level I think we've had very solid retention, I think, for all the reasons that the acquisition made a ton of sense created great opportunities for growth at NIC as well as Tyler. And I think their teams have recognized that. I think it's been -- as we look back over the last year, a smooth integration for a deal of that size, particularly one that was completed while we were still almost all remote during COVID. We've got some new, not new to NIC, but people in new senior leadership roles there, particularly Lizabeth the President and Thomas, the COO and they've done a great job of managing that team and working with the integration. So I think we're very happy with the retention and the opportunities that it's created across NIC and Tyler. Their payments team, for example, our Tyler Payments team has joined with the NIC Payments team, and they've taken the leadership there. So yes, we're really pleased with the retention there.
Lynn Moore: Yes. I think the excitement that we see in the cross opportunities and the things that we can do together, that just naturally flows up and down the organization, and I think that helps with retention.
Operator: Our final question is from Clarke Jeffries with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Clarke Jeffries: I'll keep it brief. I just wanted to get a sense of what your rough range of organic or core growth expectations are for NIC, the considerations in terms of how the revenues are being driven today and sort of how the macro is impacting that. So from the 8% today, what's the general range you expect going forward?
Brian Miller: Yes. I mean historically, NIC was about an 8% grower on average, looking back over several years, sort of pre-covid around the, what they call, state growth. So sort of a proxy for organic growth. And so that, I think, is sort of our baseline. We've seen pretty strong growth over the last couple of years with all the shift towards citizens and businesses doing more business with government digitally and so higher transaction volumes. So they're really growing off of this 8% growth, we think, is really pretty impressive this quarter, given that it's off of a very strong base that was established over the last couple of years. But I'd say that's kind of the baseline and that as we continue to drive more cross-selling and so more opportunities particularly in the payment space. And through things like the USC Direct acquisition, which is now a part of NIC, that there's certainly an opportunity to move up into the even into the low double-digit range. But for right now, I think this 8% is kind of a good baseline and all of our initiatives around the combination with Tyler should ultimately drive that higher?
Lynn Moore: Yes. I think, Clarke, obviously, taking out the near-term growth headwind of COVID, which I assume that, that was part of your -- you've taken that out. But as we go forward, it's like a lot of acquisitions. I mean they're a big stand-alone division within Tyler. But to Brian's point, a lot of the cross-sell opportunities whether or not internally, we recognize those on a different division P&L versus NIC's P&L. I think as you go over time, we don't really report on specific organic growth within our business units. And you'll see some of that just the opportunities are there. And as payments grows, some of that payments business may go to our ERP because it's going to their client base, but I see played a significant hand just like the vend engine deal in Arkansas, Kentucky, that revenue really doesn't happen without NIC yet it's sitting on the books over in our Courts & Justice division. So I think as we go forward, you'll probably see us less comment on their specific revenues and growth as they just become more integrated with NIC. We've kind of thought it was appropriate, really for the first year or so, but it will be like the rest of our other divisions because there's so much as we talked about, a lot of our opportunities are through cross-sells and how we leverage each other. And so to us, at one point, it just becomes all Tyler.
Operator: At this time, there proves to be no more questions. Mr. Moore, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.
Lynn Moore: Okay. Great. Thanks, Chris, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. If you have any more questions, please feel free to contact Brian Miller or myself. Thanks, everybody. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-04-28 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to today's Tyler Technologies First Quarter 2022 Conference Call. Your host for today's call is Lynn Moore, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded today, April 28, 2022.  And I'd like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Moore. Sir, please go ahead.
Lynn Moore: Thank you, Jamie, and welcome to our call. With me today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like for Brian to give the safe harbor statement. Next, I'll have some comments on our quarter, and then Brian will review the details of our results. I'll end with some additional comments, and then we'll take questions. Brian?
Brian Miller : Thanks, Lynn.

Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call day will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Lynn?
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. Our first quarter results surpassed our expectations and provided a very strong start to 2022. Total revenues grew approximately 55% with robust organic growth of 12.8%, the highest in 20 quarters. NIC continued to perform well in the first quarter, with core revenue growth of 13%, excluding COVID-related revenues. NIC's growth was boosted by revenues under the new statewide payments contract in Florida and in particular, by revenues associated with corporate filings with the Department of State that are concentrated in the first quarter. NIC's COVID-related revenues were in line with our expectations at $20.6 million. Recurring revenues comprised 79.5% of our quarterly revenues and were led by 140% growth in subscription revenues. On an organic basis, subscription revenues grew a robust 33.8%, reflecting both our accelerating shift to the cloud and growth in transaction-based revenues. We have now achieved greater than 20% subscription revenue growth in 57 of the last 65 quarters. We're particularly pleased with our strong revenue growth even as we saw an acceleration of the shift in our new software contract mix from licenses to SaaS. In Q1, 80% of our new software contract value was SaaS compared to 66% in Q1 last year. As we outlined on our last earnings call, while our move to the cloud builds long-term value, margins compressed in Q1, reflecting the new business mix shift, the inclusion of NIC and in particular, their COVID-related revenues, as well as expenses related to the cloud transition. As a result, our non-GAAP operating margin declined 250 basis points year-over-year to 24.3% but increased 70 basis points sequentially from Q4 of 2021. We continue to be very pleased with NIC's performance and with the growing pipeline of joint opportunities for Tyler and NIC. During the first quarter, NIC successfully extended our enterprise contract in Alabama. And in April, we extended our enterprise agreement with New Jersey. NIC also signed a new 5-year SaaS deal with the State of Mississippi to provide our NIC cannabis licensing platform valued at approximately $4.3 million. We continue to experience success with sell-through deals of Tyler products through NIC's state relationships. In Q1, those deals included sales of our data and insights platform to the state of Vermont and our entellitrak platform for Veterans Affairs in Alabama. We also signed agreements for NIC's payments platform with existing Tyler clients in Hillsboro County, Florida; Montgomery County, Maryland; and Glendale, California. Our largest new deal in the quarter was a SaaS arrangement with the San Diego Association of Governments for Enterprise ERP powered by Munis solution, along with our data and insight solution valued at approximately $4.9 million, win five notable SaaS deals, each with a total contract value greater than $2 million with Glen County, Georgia for our enterprise assessment and tax powered by IAS World Solution; the cities of Rialto, California and Alamagordo, New Mexico for our enterprise ERP powered by Munis; and enterprise permitting and licensing powered by EnerGov; and the cities of Mansfield and Burson in Texas for our enterprise ERP powered by Munis solution. Our largest license deal in Q1 was a $2.7 million agreement with the Utah Department of Public Safety, our first public safety deployment in the state of Utah. The deal includes enterprise law enforcement records, mobile, field mobile, enforcement mobile and public safety analytics.  We also signed four other notable license arrangements in the quarter, each with a total contract value -- than $1 million with the St. Johns County property appraiser in Florida for our enterprise assessment and tax powered by IAS World; the city of Elmhurst, Illinois for our enterprise ERP powered by Munis solution, St. Mary's County government in Maryland for our enterprise public safety, powered by New World and Data and insight solutions, and the city of Virginia Beach, Virginia for our enforcement mobile powered by Brazeau solution. Now I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our updated guidance for 2022.
Brian Miller : Thanks, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2022. In our earnings release, we've included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financial Reports tab schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. Both GAAP and non-GAAP revenues for the quarter were $456.1 million, up 54.7% with the inclusion of NIC and our other acquisitions from the last 12 months. Organic revenue growth was the highest since Q4 of 2016 at 12.8%. Software licenses and services grew 24.7% or 3.7%, excluding NIC. Subscription revenues rose 139.5% with very strong organic growth of 33.8%. We added 149 new subscription-based arrangements and converted a new high of 88 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $76 million in total contract value. In Q1 of last year, we added 84 new subscription-based arrangements and had 39 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $52 million in total contract value. Our software subscription bookings in the first quarter added $16.2 million in new ARR. Subscription contract value comprised approximately 80% of the total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 66% in Q1 of last year, reflecting our ongoing shift to a cloud-first approach to sales and increasing client preferences for cloud-based solutions. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 3.4 years compared to 4.0 years last year. Transaction-based revenues, which include NIC portal, payment processing and e-filing revenues and are included in subscriptions, were $150.9 million, up 461%. Excluding NIC, Tyler's transaction-based revenues grew 9.8%. E-filing revenues reached a new high of $18.2 million, up 16.9%. For the first quarter, our non-GAAP ARR was approximately $1.45 billion, up 63.6%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS software arrangements was approximately $378.1 million, up 25.1%. Transaction-based ARR was approximately $603.7 million, up 461%. And non-GAAP maintenance ARR was down slightly at approximately $468.1 million due to the continued migration of on-premises clients to the cloud. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $1.76 billion, up 13.8%. Because the vast majority of NIC's revenues are transaction-based, their backlog at quarter end was only $26.3 million. Excluding the addition of NIC, Tyler's backlog grew 12.1%. Bookings in the quarter were strong at approximately $419 million, up 70.1% including the transaction-based revenues at NIC. On an organic basis, bookings were also quite robust at approximately $283 million, up 14.7%. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1.9 billion, up 65% and on an organic basis, were approximately $1.4 billion, up 21.7%. If our weighted average contract term for new SaaS contracts has been the same as last year, organic bookings growth would have been 17.1%. Cash from operations declined this quarter by 25.3% to $53.5 million, mainly due to changes in working capital related to higher payments of accrued incentive compensation and cash tax payments related to stock-based compensation. Free cash flow declined by 33.5% to $41 million due to the decrease in cash from operations and somewhat higher capital spending this quarter. Our balance sheet remains very strong. During the quarter, we repaid $20 million of our term debt. And since completing the NIC acquisition, we have paid down $415 million of term debt. We ended the quarter with total outstanding debt of $1.32 billion and cash and investments of $322.6 million and net leverage of approximately 2.1x trailing 12-month pro forma EBITDA. As Lynn mentioned earlier, we're off to a great start in 2022, resulting in an improvement in our outlook for the full year. As a result, we have raised our 2022 annual revenue and earnings guidance as follows. We expect both GAAP and non-GAAP total revenues will be between $1.835 billion and $1.87 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic revenue growth of approximately 9.5%. We expect total revenues will include approximately $40 million of COVID-related revenues from NIC's TourHealth and pandemic rent relief services. The TourHealth revenues are currently expected to continue through the second quarter of 2022 while revenues from the rent relief program are expected to continue through the third quarter. We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be between $3.92 and $4.08 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $7.48 and $7.64. Based on updated assumptions regarding additional interest rate hikes this year, we have increased our estimated -- expense for the year by $3.4 million to $23 million, with an impact on non-GAAP diluted EPS of approximately $0.06 a share. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release. Finally, before I turn the call back to Lynn, I'd like to announce that Hala Elsherbini, will be joining Tyler as Senior Director of Investor Relations, effective May 9. Many of you have worked with Hala in the past, and we're very excited to have an IR professional with Hala's experience and knowledge of Tyler join our team. Lynn?
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. I'm very pleased with our first quarter performance and our outlook for the year. Activity in our public sector market continues to trend positively, and we are well positioned to take advantage of the continued strength in our market. We remain on track with our strategic initiatives, including our development projects to optimize our products for more efficient deployment in the cloud and our cloud-first approach to sales, which we believe will create significant long-term value for clients and shareholders alike. Our balance sheet and cash flow remained very strong and we continue to be opportunistic with regard to capital allocation. We're excited about the acquisition of US eDirect in February, which significantly expands our outdoor recreation portfolio, allowing us to offer an extensive all-in-one outdoor recreation solution that will seamlessly integrate with our NIC payments platform. While we continue to evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities, we are heavily focused on the integration and execution around the acquisitions we've completed over the last 2 years, making the bar on new acquisitions at this time relatively high. Last Thursday marked the 1-year anniversary of our landmark acquisition of NIC. As I reflect on the acquisition and all that we have accomplished as a -- entity over the last 12 months, I can truly say that it has exceeded our expectations, which were already high. Our teams have come together as one unified organization and our collective excitement about the opportunities that the combination unlocks has continued to grow. We've integrated our payments teams and have refined our strategy to pursue what we believe is a huge TAM in government payments. As we've discussed, we're winning new business with sell-throughs into our respective client bases. In this quarter, we doubled the number of sell-through opportunities in our pipeline. We look forward to continuing to report on our progress in the second year of our combination. The challenges of today's labor market continue to be an area of significant focus for us. While we added 195 new team members in the first quarter, we currently have a higher-than-normal number of open positions. Although our open positions have a short-term positive impact on margins, we have aggressive hiring plans for the balance of the year to support our growth. Finally, we're extremely excited to host clients live and in person at Connect, our annual user conference, which will take place in Indianapolis for May 15 through May 18. With that, we'd like to open up the line for Q&A.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question from Jonathan Ho from William Blair.
Jonathan Ho: Congratulations on the strong quarter. I just wanted to maybe start out with your thoughts around just the win rates that you're seeing and potentially whether the investments that you've made over the past few years are now starting to have an impact as you start to look at the state of competition?
Lynn Moore: Yes. Sure, Jonathan. And I think that's right. The markets right now are really strong. I'd say they're probably about as strong as I can remember. And our competitive position is really high, really across the board. You're right, we pre-COVID, we went through a significant period of elevated investments, and I think that's really paying off right now across all of our lines of business. Our win rates are strong. Our final rates are strong. It's really setting us up well for the next few years. And so I appreciate that comment.
Jonathan Ho: Got it. Got it. And then just as a follow-up, how should we think about sort of the pace of integration that we're seeing with AWS? And maybe what customers, when you've had some discussions with them, what's that reception been like in terms of potentially shifting from Tyler hosted to AWS?
Lynn Moore: Yes, I think that's going real well, Jonathan. AWS is going to be a great long-term partner for us. We're already starting to move customers into the AWS cloud. We're working on plans right now to exit the Tyler data centers over the next couple of years and move them into AWS. They're a great partner. Where we're going with our cloud initiative lines up well, our cultures line up well. And our clients see that. Our clients see the benefits. They see the future road map that we've laid out and our clients are excited about it.
Operator: And our next question comes from Pete Heckmann from D.A. Davidson.
Pete Heckmann: Just two questions on the annual guidance. Your very strong organic subscription growth of the first quarter seems to argue that, at least the way I look at my model, I have something more in the mid- to high teens embedded for organic growth for subscription revenue for the rest of the year, and I'm getting into the top end of your revenue guidance. Are there some other considerations we should think about why subscription revenue growth wouldn't continue to run at this elevated rate for the rest of the year?
Brian Miller : Well, Pete, I think the biggest factor there, and we mentioned it in the remarks, is there is some seasonality around some of the transaction-based revenues around payments. There's, I think, two things around that. One, as we pointed out, the Florida contract for statewide payments with NIC, which is a new contract, is ramping up, but there were some revenues in Q1 that are specific to Q1 around filings -- revenues associated with corporate filings with the Department of State in Florida. And that added, I think, roughly close to $6.5 million of revenue in subscriptions in Q1. And so actually accounted for a couple hundred basis points of overall growth in the quarter that really aren't expected to be there throughout the year. And then seasonally, in Q4, some of the transaction-based revenues around the portals tend to be a little lighter as well. So I think those are the biggest factors. But certainly, we have an opportunity to continue to broaden our subscription revenues as we move through the year. But I keep those seasonality factors in mind.
Lynn Moore: Yes. I think, Pete, I'd just add that the thing about the Secretary State filings in Florida is it was a little bit somewhat unexpected as we entered the year. And I think it shows the potential of not just the Florida payment contracts and extending it beyond what I think probably NIC's original expectations were before they joined Tyler, but really the things that we can do across the country. And so while there's some seasonality to that, to me, it's an exciting indicator things that we can achieve down the road.
Pete Heckmann: Great. Great. And that helps. I missed the significance of that. And then just in terms of the expense ramp we talked about last quarter that's embedded in your annual guidance, you talked about maybe hiring running behind schedule. But generally, would you say that the expense levels in the first quarter were at your expectations? A little bit below? I'm just trying to figure out if that contributed to the upside, at least from our forecast to the earnings number in the quarter.
Lynn Moore: Yes. I'd say as it relates to headcount, Pete, is probably a little bit below, and that's been really the case for probably at least a year or so. And my sense is that's the case generally across all industries right now. There's certainly a lot of labor market challenges. It certainly helps with margins in the short term. We want to be a little more aggressive, and we are aggressive. We are -- our HR department is working hard but -- so that we can deliver on a lot of the sales, the good sales activity that we've had over the long run, being able to get these installations deployed, continuing to keep our customers happy is going to require getting some of those heads in.
Operator: And our next question comes from Josh Reilly from Needham.
Josh Reilly : Congrats on the strong quarter here. How would you characterize the impact of the stimulus funds benefiting the 13% organic growth rate in the quarter? And how much of a tailwind can this be over the next couple of years? Is it closer to a 1- to 2-point benefit? Or could it be up to a 5-point benefit to sales?
Lynn Moore: Yes, Josh, it's a good question. It's, at times -- it's hard to sometimes to isolate. I think what I would say -- I'd go back to my comment to Jonathan's question about the budgets overall. From what I'm seeing right now, our clients' budgets are as healthy as they've ever been. Leading up 2018, 2019, the economy was really good. The budgets were really strong. There was an anticipation of negative COVID impact that prediction really didn't come through. And since then, as you mentioned, we've lumped on a lot of stimulus money. In addition to that, and I think I mentioned on the last call, perhaps we all see what's going on out there in the real estate market and the boom that's going on there, which is driving appraisals and valuations up, which further than drives up assessments and property taxes, which is a big funder of a lot of our -- particularly with our local government clients. We're seeing the impact. It's sometimes hard to track individual deals. But we're certainly seeing the impact and the fact that I think it's a very robust market right now. You got something?
Brian Miller : Yes. All I would add is that the stimulus money is available through the end of 2024 for them to make commitments around spending that. And so I'd say we're still -- we believe a lot of governments haven't -- certainly haven't fully spent their funds or still in the process of determining where those will be spent. So we believe it's a a potential tailwind through the next 2 or 3 years. But I'd say right now, it's probably -- if there's an impact there, it's probably fairly modest. It's not 5 points of growth. But it's certainly part of that very active market we're seeing.
Josh Reilly : Got it. That's helpful. And then just curious on the US eDirect acquisition, is there anything specific in terms of the functionality that you acquired there that's different than what you had internally for parks and recreation?
Lynn Moore: Yes, sure. And I'd say the answer to that is yes, we're really good complement. I mean, the outdoor market is something that we believe is a good growth opportunity. We believe the TAM is there. There is demand for this sort of all-in-one solution. And really what NIC brought was really a first-in-class solution around hunting and fishing licenses and US eDirect really was a leading outdoor reservation platform. So it sort of combines that into creating, as we said, sort of an all-in-one opportunity. We've seen the pipeline already just this year grow significantly in that space. And I think one of the things that we're excited about is not just combining the NIC technology with US eDirect, which is also, by the way, deployed in AWS, but our ability to go out and sell it. So it's a solution -- when you talk about outdoor reservations and stuff, it's not just going in the states, which will be through NIC sales channels, but we also have the ability to go sell it more locally through some of Tyler's sales channels.
Operator: And our next question comes from Terry Tillman from Truist Securities.
Terry Tillman: And -- the congrats on the first quarter results. Maybe a couple of questions for me. And one is a follow-up to a prior question on the stimulus dollars. What about on the enterprise ERP business side? So those are longer sales cycle type deals, big transformation projects. I think maybe you mentioned San Diego. But how is that sales pipeline playing out? And do you see like a quarter where -- if the pipeline is building, where you see a lot of conversions? Or do you think that's going to be more smooth over the next couple of years -- 2 or 3 years on the enterprise ERP side?
Lynn Moore: Yes. I think, generally speaking, what we're seeing on enterprise ERP is the market is, and the deals that we're signing each quarter, really reflects sort of pre-COVID levels. So that's very encouraging. We have identified a handful of deals that are specific -- that can be tied specifically to the ARPA funding and things like that. But again, sometimes it's hard to know specifically where a jurisdiction, how they allocate those funds. We don't normally sort of get that 1:1 rate. Our growth -- our deal volume is enterprise ERP is good. We're really focusing on expanding payments through that customer base. As you mentioned, we're focusing on expanding our flips, which are continuing to increase at a faster rate quarter-by-quarter. Our installed client sales continue to be really strong there. So it's a very healthy business that's continuing to grow, and we're pretty pleased with the outlook.
Terry Tillman: Got it. And on the state of Utah, that was great to see that state-wide public safety deal. Maybe, and maybe easier said than done, but it seems like a great rinse and repeat opportunity across the broader NIC customer base with all these public safety solutions you have. Not trying to put you on the spot, but could we see more, and more quickly, with a repeat of what we saw with State Utah on the public safety side?
Lynn Moore: Well, we're -- I guess I'd step back and just say, yes, we're excited about all of our cross-sell opportunities through the NIC base. The Utah deal was a great win for our public safety team. Very large contract. I think it's early to say that -- I mean, obviously, part of our sales plan is to repeat these types of wins. That's part of our playbook. It may be -- to say that those can happen relatively quickly. Sales cycles still sort of take a life of their own, but we're excited the way our teams are working together across all of our products and the potential with NIC.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt VanVliet from BTIG.
Matt VanVliet: Nice job on the quarter. Lynn, I wanted to follow up on something you mentioned at the end of your prepared remarks, and maybe it's a bit of a follow-up to Terry's last question there. But you mentioned that the pipeline for sell-through opportunities has doubled. Curious if you look at the assessment of kind of all of the NIC customer portfolio, how far along are you in terms of kind of following up with those potential sell-through opportunities? Have you doubled that? Have you sort of gotten to all of those customers? Or is there still more that could be added to the pipeline in the near term?
Lynn Moore: Yes, I would say we're a year now into the NIC acquisition. Standing here a year later, I'm more than pleasantly surprised at how the teams are working and the number of opportunities that have already surfaced. Stepping back, looking at maybe a 20,000-foot level, we may still be in the first inning of this deal. We've got a long way to go. We're still learning about each other. We're still learning -- while we spent a lot of time last year educating both teams on products and sales channels and the ways to go about addressing the market, I think we're just barely scratching the surface of what we can achieve together.
Matt VanVliet: All right. Very helpful. And then I guess maybe thinking about the stimulus and the ARPA funds from a little different angle. Have you seen sales cycles shorten at all? Or do you feel like some deals have gotten pushed through maybe a little more quickly because there's more budget dollars available? And would you allocate some of that rationale to having more of the stimulus funds out there? Or has there not been any kind of consistency across the time to contract?
Lynn Moore: Yes. I would say that on one level, it's -- I've talked about the robust market. I think my comment there would be, some of it is still just release of pent-up demand during COVID. I do think we're seeing a little bit maybe quicker sales cycles in some of our inside sales and that may be a little bit more directly tied to some ARPA funding. But we're also -- one thing I didn't mention earlier is one of the things that we're doing across Tyler is we're being pretty proactive about marketing the availability of the ARPA funds and how our clients can use them. We've done several webinars and podcasts and blogs and e-mails to sort of help stimulate that use and hopefully direct some of it to Tyler.
Operator: Our next question comes from Saket Kalia from Barclays.
Saket Kalia: Okay. Great. Appreciate you having me on the call. Maybe first for you, Brian, actually, just to maybe mix it up. It felt like software and services bookings were maybe stronger than what we've seen historically and SaaS was maybe a little bit more in line. And again, that's on a bookings perspective. Part of that, I think, you called out is rightfully duration. But curious if you saw anything in mix or preference for on-prem versus SaaS? And how are you sort of thinking about that for the rest of the year?
Brian Miller : Yes. I think it was an interesting quarter from a new business perspective because even though SaaS, as a percentage of the new deal volume increased pretty significantly over last year from 66% to 80%. And we also saw growth in license revenues and had several pretty decent sized, not super large, but several decent-sized license deals, including the Utah Public Safety deal and some ERP deals. So we saw a little bit of both. On a broad basis, our expectation for the year is around 80 to the low 80s percentage of our new contract volume coming in, in SaaS. So we're generally on line with that, but we would expect that we continue to see an ongoing shift towards that preference for new customers to come through the cloud. And as we talked about at year-end, part of that is -- reflects the change in our approach to sales and including a number of significant products that are now only available through the cloud that are no longer being offered in a license model in new proposals. So yes, we'd expect that trend to continue through the year.
Saket Kalia: Got it. Got it. Lynn, maybe that's a good segue for a question I have for you. We've talked about some tools that were offered both on-prem and SaaS but might phase out on-prem this year. I think we've talked about maybe 1 or 2 of the ERP products as an example. Can you just recap that for us? And then without preannouncing anything, of course, but are there other products where that might make sense to do as well in terms of leading with SaaS and maybe not even offering on-prem anymore? Does that make sense?
Lynn Moore: Yes. No, I understand your question, and you're right. So coming into this year, and we announced, I think maybe in Q3 of last year, certainly on the Q4 call, our enterprise ERP powered by Munis solutions are now really just being offered in a SaaS model. I have made the comment that you should expect to see more of our core flagship products move in that direction including probably one later this year and moving into next year. I'm a little hesitant to outline some of that right now because we haven't even notified all of our customers yet of our future strategy. Our clients generally know that we are going cloud first. That's not a surprise to anyone. But in terms of specific time lines, I'd rather sort of keep that messaging within us right now until we're ready to do that. But that's our strategic direction. It's not a surprise to anyone. We're making progress on our cloud initiatives, and we will reach the point generally across our portfolio with perhaps the exception of parts of public safety, which will be a little bit -- which will be market driven. And then we talked before, they've been a little bit slower to move to the cloud.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo.
Unidentified Analyst: This is David [Unger] filling in for Michael Turrin. I just wanted to focus on free cash flow margin. Brian, I know you mentioned there were some things that happened this quarter. You mentioned cash taxes and working capital. But I just wanted to get a sense for -- I mean, historically, you do like 22% free cash flow margin over the past 5 years. So I just wanted to get an understanding of the seasonality of that and how that will work itself out over the course of the year?
Brian Miller : Yes. I generally expect that our free cash flow margins, there's a lot of puts and takes there. But generally, as we move through this year, probably in line with that historical number. Very seasonal in terms of being weighted towards the third quarter. A lot of that has to do with the vast majority of our maintenance renewals, which are around $470 million a year of maintenance revenues. The vast majority of those renew as of July 1. And so we typically bill those in Q2 and collect them in Q3. So that drives really strong growth in our cash flow in our cash flow in Q3. And other than that transaction revenues, we've talked about some seasonality around those being a little lighter in Q4. But as we continue to expand the subscription business, that tends to smooth out the cash flow. So Q3 -- Q1 is typically the lightest. Q3 is very much the strongest, but I think the margins, you can expect to be fairly consistent.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And I know there are several questions asked about the fiscal stimulus, and this is -- sorry to beat the dead horse on this, but I think it's maybe a couple of quarters ago, you mentioned the couple dozen or so deals that are in the pipeline that are sourced from fiscal stimulus. Is that still roughly a similar type number? Just trying to get a sense of that.
Brian Miller : Yes, it's probably similar. But as Lynn said, it becomes harder and harder to identify deals that are specifically funded by stimulus. And there are certainly some of those. But in a lot of cases, the stimulus may be used for something else, but frees up funds that are then used to move forward with something they're purchasing from us. So it's not exactly a science trying to pin down that number. But I'd say it's probably a fairly consistent number of deals that we're seeing, which is consistent with what we're saying that we expect this not to be a big flood of new business at one time, but to be somewhat of a tailwind over the next, call it, 3 years.
Operator: And our next question comes from Charles Strauzer from CJS Securities.
Charles Strauzer: Brian, maybe you can help me with this on. Looking at Q2, other than the continuation of the COVID revenue, what are the factors should we think about when we build out our model for Q2?
Brian Miller : This -- I don't think there's anything particularly unusual to think about in Q2. We would expect, I think, licenses to likely be at a fairly similar level to what we saw in Q1. Subscriptions should continue to grow. I think maintenance, as we've said in the past, for the year is likely to be flat to down low single digits, and I think we'll continue to see that trend as we have more and more on-prem clients move to subscription. But I think those broad ranges of growth that we talked about on the year-end call are still generally true. When we talk about -- we don't give quarterly guidance, but when we talk about the full year, I think licenses will likely see a mid-single-digit decline. Services are likely to be around the mid-teens kind of growth. Subscriptions, expect to remain really solid growth in the 25% to 30% range for the year. Maintenance, as I said, flat to down low single digits. Appraisal is seeing a nice resurgence in activity after some slowdowns during COVID and expect to see high teens growth there. And hardware is a much smaller piece of our business. But with Connect coming back in person this year, those revenues fall there. So we expect to see kind of mid-30% growth on a relatively small base of revenues in hardware and other.
Lynn Moore: Yes. And then I'd probably add to that, Charlie, I think we mentioned earlier, the COVID -- the TourHealth revenues out of NIC should -- our expectation is those pretty much wind down in Q2.
Charles Strauzer: Great. That's very helpful. And then just lastly for me on the cash flow side, is debt pay down is still kind of your top priority for use of cash?
Lynn Moore: I'm sorry -- yes. So yes, Charlie, I think right now, our priority is to pay down the debt, particularly as interest rates have continued to increase. We already talked about readjusting our plan for the higher rates and it costs us an extra $0.06. So that's our priority. We're continuing to do everything else we've always done, which is be opportunistic, look at our internal R&D. We continue to look at acquisitions. With the softness in the market, we'll continue to evaluate repurchase opportunities versus the paying down the debt. But I'd say right now, that's our priority. Just as a reminder, as Brian mentioned, we paid down $415 million of the debt. And of our outstanding debt, about $600 million is sitting in a convertible, which right now is about 45%, and that's at a fixed rate 25 basis points that's not maturing until '26. I'd like to see us get some of that bank debt paid down. But again, if opportunities present themselves, we'll probably move on those as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI.
Kirk Materne: Lynn, when you look at the sort of organic Tyler business and you think across ERP and Munis, Courts & Justice, Public Safety, my sense listening to you is that the pipeline is pretty balanced and you're seeing a nice sort of rebound or growth in all of those areas. Are there any sort of points of strength versus maybe not as strong yet? I was just kind of curious how we should think about that if there's any one product that kind of leads you out of a downturn or if they're all pretty balanced right now?
Lynn Moore: I'd say generally, they're pretty balanced. Like I mentioned earlier, our reprise ERP, powered by Munis solution, that market is -- we're seeing the deal volume that's similar to pre-COVID. Really, at the lower end, we continue to see deal volume and growth higher than pre-COVID, which is great. And that's our ERP Pro, our old [incode] solution. If you look at our appraisal and tax solutions, we started to see some increasing sales momentum late last year, and we're seeing that start to continue. You look at Courts & Justice, we've made a number of acquisitions in the last couple of years, and we're pretty bullish on expanding those markets, whether it's our vend engine, our corrections. There's a lot of opportunity there. We're seeing that. We're also -- I think we sort of referenced it, our e-filing is back to prepandemic levels, which is good to see. And public safety continues to do the things that we expected to do with out of these investments. They signed another large deal. Their competitive position is strong. They've done a good job with their clients on some of these new products, getting them live, getting them settle, getting referenceable. So across the board, it's pretty good across the board, maybe it's a few places a little bit better than others, but generally speaking, I'd say it's pretty healthy.
Kirk Materne: That's helpful. And Brian, with 80 -- around 80% of the sort of booked software in the quarter being more subscription-based. If it continues at this rate, does the overhang on margins in terms of the conversion essentially start to drop off a little bit? I'm just trying to get a sense on how much of sort of the overhang on margins that we're looking ahead is just on sort of the business model conversion versus more discrete items?
Brian Miller : Yes. I think that kind of fits in with what we talked about at year-end as kind of what we expect to see with margins over the next couple of years, and we talked about the pressure on margins from not just the bubble costs associated with the cloud transition and moving from Tyler data centers to AWS. But the impact on margins and revenue from sort of the runoff of the licenses and as those -- as that business continues to shift towards a higher percentage coming in the SaaS. And we said, really, by the end of -- both of those have impacts over the next couple of years. But we think that sort of that inflection point where licenses or the runoff of the remaining licenses or the shift of those into SaaS model no longer has a negative impact on margins because we have built up that run rate of subscription revenues, and we really believe that 2023 is sort of the trough on margins. And that after that -- and part of that is the lessening of the impact of the mix shift. So what we're seeing this year is pretty much in line with how we looked at the estimated mix going in. But we do expect that percentage at 80% to continue to grow.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Zukin from Wolfe Research.
Alex Zukin: So I guess I want to drill into a figure that you're -- that you give us in the supplemental disclosures, and that's calculated SaaS net new ARR. I'm trying to square the commentary around the strength of the subscription business as a percentage -- or of SaaS contracts as a percentage of the total going up year-over-year. But then when I look at net new ARR of $6 million, it's down pretty substantially year-over-year and sequentially. And I know that's a very volatile seasonal metric. But just help us understand why that is? Also, if you think about the year in terms of the mix between new core Tyler business license versus SaaS, how are we thinking about that? Meaning -- like what type of net new ARR growth should we kind of think about this year versus the kind of license decline? Or is license going to be flat? I think that would be a good thing to just explore.
Brian Miller : Yes. There is some lumpiness in the growth in ARR around -- as there is with our license and our bookings. We do expect for the full year licenses to decline and to be down likely sort of in the mid-single digits. And we expect subscription revenues to grow in the 25% to 30% range. And we would expect that new ARR would also grow in that 25% to 30% range.
Alex Zukin: Got it. Okay. And so I guess, from a -- is there anything that was just different seasonally from a deal construction standpoint this quarter versus maybe previous last year's Q1 or anything to read into?
Brian Miller : Not that I'm aware of. I think it's just a little bit of the lumpiness of the structure of the contracts, but not aware of anything that's particularly notable in terms of a difference from the prior year.
Alex Zukin: Got it. And then I guess, are the -- do you feel like -- it sounds like you were a little surprised at the strength of the license business in Q1. Is there -- do you feel like those changes -- it's going to be the changes in the incentive structures or in the product that's going to drive that change in mix in the second half? Or I guess, what -- where could you be wrong with respect to that?
Lynn Moore: I'd say there that for the year, I think our licenses are sort of on track with our plan. They were a little higher in Q1 than our expectations. Some of that comes through our robust inside sales. Some of those -- or tend to be -- have trended to be more license than our expectation. Our new business generally is in line with our expectation. I think our licenses outlook for the year is in line, but it was higher in Q1, which obviously helped with our organic growth number.
Alex Zukin: Perfect. And then just the last one on cash flow. I guess, Brian, if you think about it as we progress through the year given those -- given some of those mix shift dynamics, what's the right way to think about the free cash flow progression through the year?
Brian Miller : Yes, I still think that, again, we still have a big base of maintenance, that a lot of that cash flow comes in Q3. So still expect that the progression will probably be similar to what we saw last year that Q3 would be, by far, the peak of cash flow, but Q4 should be relatively strong as well. But I think we still sort of follow the historical seasonality of cash flow. Our CapEx should be fairly consistent across the year. And the -- obviously, the recurring revenues with a much bigger base of transaction-based revenues helped smooth out the seasonality around that piece of our revenues.
Operator: Our next question comes from Keith Housum from Northcoast Research.
Keith Housum: Just following up on the last question actually. I was going to ask the same thing but more from a booking standpoint. Bookings in the quarter of $419 million were the lowest of the past 4 quarters. Is it just a matter of more timing in terms of either the pipeline is healthy, but the deals haven't closed just given some the optimism we're hearing here? Or is duration playing a part of it where that durations attributing to, I guess, lower bookings amount this quarter than what we see in the past 3?
Brian Miller : Yes. Duration is certainly a part of it. This quarter with the 3.4 years duration of our new subscription deals is much closer to what we're trying to drive to with sort of a standard of 3 years on most of our new subscription deals. So that certainly played a part in it. It's down from 4 years last year. And I think that also would be the lowest average duration we've seen over, call it, the last year or so. So I think that's playing a part in it. Bookings growth on an organic basis was still pretty solid at north of -- I think, the number was 14%. So duration certainly would be one of the factors there. But we feel pretty good about bookings growth actually being on an organic basis being ahead of where revenue growth currently is.
Keith Housum: Okay. I appreciate that. And in terms of the --
Brian Miller : Again on maintenance because those bookings come in when those renewals happen in Q2. Q2 typically is a stronger seasonal bookings quarter just because of where the maintenance falls and Q1 is pretty light there. So it's -- the subscription bookings were certainly the strongest point of the bookings growth this quarter, which is what we like to see.
Keith Housum: Okay. I appreciate that. And just in terms of the employees, and I appreciate the commentary that there's some more hiring that needs to be done. But can you speak a little bit about, I guess, turnover and inflationary cost pressures? Obviously, it's been a very dynamic quarter in terms of inflationary pressures. But as the year is developing, is it worse than you expected in terms of what you guys are pulling up for new employees? Or just any commentary on that matter?
Lynn Moore: Yes. So there's a lot there, Keith, to talk about. We mentioned, I think, in our last earnings call that part of our OP pressure this year was the fact that we were generally increasing our budget for employee compensation a little higher than we had traditionally. The labor market challenges are out there. Our turnover is higher than historic. But from what we see and the studies that we look at, we still believe it's lower than most in the tech industry. The competition is stuff out there right now. I sometimes look at it, however, in terms of -- when I think about external factors, be it inflation or recession concerns or the labor market is what do we do within Tyler? How does it impact us versus our competitors? And people like to come to work here. We've got a good culture. I like to think that -- some of these things may disproportionately affect some of our maybe perhaps smaller competitors as it relates to inflation and pricing. As you know, most of our agreements or annual agreements or multiyear agreements with some the ability with escalators. We have the ability to adjust those -- adjust pricing on our services that we send out there. So I think we're in a position where we can attack inflation -- inflationary pressures. Our people are working hard to staff and hire. We've got -- we've done a lot of business in the last year, and we need to go execute on some of it. And that's part of it is we need to get some people in here to go execute on some of these deals we've sold.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brent Bracelin from Piper Sandler.
Brent Bracelin: Lynn, I wanted to double-click into the payment business, in particular, just revisiting the upside in the quarter from the Florida statewide contract. Pretty meaningful contribution, that begs the question, how many other states are you active in discussions with replicating what you did in Florida today? And then could you maybe talk about the 5-year opportunity? Do you think this is an opportunity where you could get a dozen states that potentially could look more like that Florida contract? Or is it a bigger opportunity than that?
Lynn Moore: Yes. So with the Florida upside in the first quarter around the Secretary of State filings, we anticipated to have the Secretary of State filings, the manner in which the revenue model turned out to be a little bit different than we had anticipated, and we were able to go with the convenience fee as opposed to a per click per payment percentage, and that drove significantly higher dollars to us. My comments are really about the fact that the extension of what we can do with Tyler, we've talked about being able to be in the local markets in Florida. Our ability because of our robust payment engine to be able to do things that certain other payment providers can't do that are in our focus on the government space drives that as you look out towards other states and other localities. But payments is one of our big future growth drivers. It's something that all of our divisions are focusing on. And I think it's something that you're going to see drive growth over time. It's going to -- like a lot of our long-term growth drivers, it will ramp up over time. And if you say, where are we out 5 years from now, we think the market's pretty big. The TAM for payments is, I think, well north of $500 million and we're positioned and are targeting to go get a vast majority of that.
Brent Bracelin: Helpful of color. And then, Brian, just as a follow-up on the maintenance side of the business. Certainly encouraged to see the SaaS mix increasing. Sounding like 80% of new contract volumes are going to be SaaS related. The flip side of that is maintenance. Maintenance, I would expect, at some point, would decline at a steeper pace with that mix shift, but it hasn't yet. I mean -- a slow decline. What's the offset there? What -- is there annual price escalators that are helping insulate maintenance? And again, I understand it's a slow decline here, but what's the offset that maybe we might see a steeper decline and -- or not preventing a steeper decline in maintenance?
Brian Miller : The offset really is the annual increases. I mean most of our maintenance agreements, the vast majority of them are annual agreements, so renewable annually with pricing adjustments annually. And historically, I'd say, across most of our customers, we're typically in the 4% to 5% annual increase on a pretty consistent basis over a number of years, and that hasn't changed. So yes, on the base, we typically get that, at least low single-digit annual increase. We, as you know, have very, very low attrition in terms of customers leaving us. In terms of dollars, probably around 1%. And then certainly, as fewer new customers come to us in a license model with maintenance that there's smaller and smaller number of new adds, but we have that 20% of our new business that is coming in license does generate new maintenance. And then the bigger impact that is likely to accelerate over the coming years is the flips or the migrations of those on-premise customers that are currently paying us maintenance moving into the cloud and shifting to subscription. So it's a change in what revenue line they come on, but does typically, rough numbers, double what they're paying us over maintenance. So while we lose maintenance revenues, we gain close to 2x that on the subscription line.
Lynn Moore: And I'd add there, Brent, that while we talk about our flips and our flips continue to increase quarter by quarter, I think our flips are year-over-year, up maybe about 125%. Much like my comment on NIC, we're still in the very, very early innings on flips. That's a long road map and a long tailwind. And as our products continue to get more cloud efficient, more cloud optimized, as we as we develop more systems to make that a little bit more of an efficient process, that's something that will be a tailwind for the next several years.
Brent Bracelin: Great to hear. It looks like that cloud first strategy is resonating out there. So sounds good.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll be ending today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Moore, I'll turning the call back over to you for closing remarks.
Lynn Moore: Great. Thanks, everybody, for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to myself or Brian Miller. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll be concluding today's conference call. We do thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-17 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello and welcome to today’s Tyler Technologies Fourth Quarter 2021 Conference Call. Your host for today’s call is Lynn Moore, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, February 17, 2022. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Moore. Please go ahead.
Lynn Moore: Thank you, Gary, and welcome to our call. With me today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I’d like for Brian to give the Safe Harbor statement. Next, I’ll have some comments on our quarter and then Brian will review the details of our results. I’ll end with some additional comments on 2021 and our longer term outlook and then we’ll take questions. Brian?
Brian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. During the course of this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information and may include projections concerning the company’s future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Also, we're officially launching next week our new brand architecture, a broad company initiative that better organizes the name Tyler' Products and Solutions to represent the verticals and markets we serve. The new brand architecture uses functional descriptive product names and has eliminated all individual product logos. Tyler Solutions have been organized under five solution portfolios, public administration, health and human services, courts and public safety, schools and transformative technology. Throughout the call today, we'll refer to product and solution names using the new architecture. Lynn?
Lynn Moore: Thanks Brian. Our fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations and continue to the positive momentum from the first three quarters to provide a strong finish to 2021. We're pleased that revenue growth continue to rebound, even as we experience revenue headwinds from the accelerating shift of new business to our SaaS model. Total revenues grew 53% with solid organic growth increasing to 9.2%. NIC continued its strong performance in the fourth quarter as well with core revenue growth of 7.5% excluding COVID related revenues. As expected, COVID related revenues declined sequentially from the third quarter of 2021 and were slightly above our plan at $16.6 million as the Omicron variant increased demand for testing in December and revenues from our new initiative supporting rent relief programs in Virginia came online. Recurring revenues comprised over 80% of our quarterly revenues for the second consecutive quarter and were led by 144% growth in subscription revenues. Excluding NIC revenues, subscription revenue growth was robust at 28.1% again, reflecting our accelerating shift to the cloud. We have now achieved greater than 20% subscription revenue growth in 56 of the last 64 quarters. We continue to experience pressure on margins in Q4, as we have throughout the year as a result of several factors. Some low margin revenues such as billable travel that declined substantially in 2020 due to the pandemic began to return in 2021. In addition, some expenses that also declined in 2020 have also started to return including business travel, trade shows and employee health costs. Margins have also been impacted by the inclusion of NIC including their lower margin gross payments contracts and COVID initiative revenues. As a result, our non-GAAP operating margin declined 330 basis points to 23.6%. And while our accelerating move to the cloud continues to build long term value, the increase in the SaaS mix of new business also weighed on our fourth quarter margins as SaaS accounted for 77% of our new contract volume in the quarter versus 73% last year. We continue to be very pleased with NIC's performance in the market and with the growing pipeline of joint opportunities for Tyler and NIC. During the fourth quarter NIC was successful in competitive rebids for enterprise contracts in South Carolina and Indiana payments and with renewals or extensions of enterprise agreements in Mississippi, Arkansas, Colorado, Hawaii and Texas Payments. We believe that Tyler's acquisition of NIC was a positive factor in the extension of these client relationships in particular, the inclusion of our enterprise data platform powered by Socrata was a material differentiator in the successful competitive rebid for South Carolina. We had nine combined sell through wins in the quarter where Tyler products were sold through NIC state enterprise contracts, or with influence from NIC state teams. These wins contained a number of Tyler products and services, including our enterprise data platform powered by Socrata, case management development platform powered by IntelliTrack, VendEngine, and NIC payments and generated over $1 million in new ARR for Tyler. We also continue to experience increased cross-selling opportunities across Tyler's product suites, especially for our enterprise data platform and our two largest new SaaS deals in the fourth quarter were examples. The first deal was with the city of Lawrence, Kansas valued at approximately $4.3 million and the second was with the city of Hammond, Indiana valued at approximately $3.8 million. Both new contracts included our enterprise ERP powered by Munis, enterprise permitting and licensing powered by EnerGov and enterprise data platform powered by Socrata Solutions among others. In addition, we signed a new combination license and SaaS deal with the Colorado division of Real Estate valued at nearly $1 million for our case management and development platform and enterprise data platform solutions, as well as NIC's electronic payment solution. This is also a great example of not only our ability to add value by offering multiple Tyler solutions in a single deal, but also the ability to win follow-on deals with various agencies. As you recall, in Q2 of 2021, we signed a $9.3 million contract with the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies, Division of Professions and Occupations for similar products, which paved the way for this deal with the division of real estate. Other significant new SaaS operations signed this quarter each with a total contract value of greater than $2 million included the City of Camas, Washington for enterprise ERP and Enterprise Permitting and Licensing Solutions, Baton Rouge, Louisiana for Enterprise Justice and Supervision Solutions powered by Odyssey, the City of Taunton, Massachusetts for our enterprise ERP solution, Caldwell County, Texas for our Enterprise Justice and Jury Solutions and the City of Snoqualmie, Washington for our enterprise ERP solution. For our premise license contracts, notable new signings included the Lee County Clerk of the Courts and Comptroller in Florida valued at approximately $2.9 million and the City of Woodland, California valued at approximately $1.4 million for our enterprise ERP solution and the cities of Colorado Springs, Colorado and Salem, Oregon for our enterprise public safety solutions valued at approximately $2.4 million and $1.4 million respectively. Now I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our guidance on 2022.
Brian Miller: Thanks Lynn yesterday. Tyler Technologies reported its results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2021. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we've belief facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the financial reports GAAP, schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. GAAP revenues for the quarter were $433.5 million up 53% with the inclusion of NIC and our other acquisitions. Non-GAAP revenues were $434.2 million up 53.2%. On an organic basis GAAP and non-GAAP revenues both grew 9.2%. Software licenses and services grew 21.1% or 4.6% excluding NIC. Subscription revenues rose 144.1%. Excluding the contribution from NIC, subscription revenues were still very strong growing 28.1%. We added 135 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 71 existing on-premises clients representing approximately $74 million in total contract value. In Q4 of last year, we added 118 new subscription based arrangements and 50 on-premises conversions representing approximately $73 million in total contract value. Our software subscription bookings in the fourth quarter added $14.8 million in new annual recurring revenue. Subscription contract value comprised approximately 77% of the total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 73% in Q4 of last year, reflecting in our ongoing shift to a cloud first approach to sales and increasing client preferences for cloud based solutions. The valuated average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 3.9 years compared to 3.5 last year. Transaction based revenues, which include NIC portal, payment processing and e-filing revenues and are included in subscriptions were $137.1 million up almost fivefold from last year. E-filing revenues reached a new high of $17.6 million up 13.4%. Excluding NIC, Tyler's transaction-based revenues grew 14%. For the fourth quarter, our annualized non-GAAP total recurring revenue or ARR was approximately $1.4 billion up 63.7%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS software arrangements for Q4 was approximately $372 million up 34%. Transaction based ARR was approximately $548 million up 458% and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was down slightly at approximately $471 million due to the continued migration of on-premises clients to the cloud. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $1.8 billion up 12.6%. Because the vast majority of NIC's revenues are transaction based, their backlog at quarter end was only $24 million. Excluding the addition of N I Tyler's backlog grew 11.1%. Our bookings in the quarter were robust at $464 million up 39.3%, including the transaction based revenues of NIC. On an organic basis, bookings were approximately $347 million up 4.2%. As a reminder, bookings in the fourth quarter of 2020 included a large contract for tax software and appraisal services valued at approximately only $18 million making for a tough bookings comparison. For the year, bookings were approximately $1.8 billion up 41.6% and on an organic basis, were approximately $1.4 billion up 11.7%. Our business continues to generate cash at a high level and for the fourth quarter, cash from operations grew almost 30% and free cash flow grew 13.7% to $95.1 million. Our balance sheet also remains very strong. During the quarter, we repaid $87.5 million for our term debt and since the NIC acquisition, we've repaid $395 million of debt. We ended the quarter with total outstanding debt of $1.34 billion and cash in investments of $407.8 million and net leverage of approximately 2.07 times, trailing 12 months, pro forma EBITDA. Turning to 2022, our focus continues to be on our strategic activities around our cloud transition on several fronts. Although this creates some short term pressure on revenue, growth and margins that Lynn will discuss in more detail, we believe the acceleration of this strategy is creating significant long term value for shareholders and clients. Our 2022 annual guidance reflects the impact of these strategic activities and is as follows. We expect both GAAP and non-GAAP total revenues will be between $1.83 billion and $1.87 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 9.5%. We expect total revenues will include approximately $36 million of COVID related revenues from NIC's tour health and pandemic rent relief services. The tour health revenues are expected to continue through the first half of 2022 while revenues from the rent relief program are expected to continue throughout the year. We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be be between $4.09 and $4.26, and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $7.41 and $7.58. To provide a little more color on our revenue guidance, we expect that our license revenues will decline in the mid-single digits in 2022, while subscription revenues will grow 25% to 30%. Excluding COVID related revenues, subscriptions are expected to grow in the mid to high thirties. Maintenance will be flat to down low single digits, software services, appraisal services and hardware and other revenues are each expected to grow in the low to mid-teens. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn.
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. I'm very pleased with our fourth quarter results, especially with regard to our sales and revenue performance. Activity in the public sector market continues to trend positively with indicators such as RFP and demo activity generally at or above pre-COVID levels. It's also gratifying that our NIC operations are executing at a high level, and that we're seeing early successes in achieving the go to market objectives we envisioned around the acquisition. For example, NIC was recently awarded an early three year extension to its Texas Payments contract at existing rates. Similar to the South Carolina rebid, the inclusion of Tyler's enterprise data platform and in particular payment insights with fraud detection and prevention proved to be a major factor in obtaining this early extension. We're very excited to expand NIC's portfolio of software solutions with the acquisition of USC Direct, which we completed last week. USC Direct has a market leading AWS cloud hosted outdoor reservation platform for the fast growing campground and outdoor recreation management market, which complements our existing strength in the hunting and fishing license market. This combination will allow us to create a very competitive all in one outdoor solution, addressing an estimated $2 million market while also expanding our payments opportunity. USC Direct is now a part of our NIC division, and we welcome their 60 team members to Tyler. Now I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss our accelerator move to the cloud, including the expected impact on our results in both the near term and the long term. As most of you know, we have operated in a hybrid model for many years, offering our core products in either an on-premises model with an upfront license and annual maintenance or a SaaS model with a software generally hosted in a Tyler data center and a multiyear subscription revenue stream. Since our first SaaS client Eau Claire [ph] Wisconsin chose Tyler in 2000. The mix of clients choosing our SaaS model grew slowly but steadily as we pursued a cloud agnostic approach to sales and let the market decide the pace at which it would move to the cloud. And as with many things in the public sector, our market has moved to the cloud more slowly than the private sector. In fact, it took until 2019 for the majority of our new business to come to us in the cloud a year in which we also recognize an all-time high $100.2 million in license revenues. 2019 was also the year in which we made the strategic decision to shift our future model from a cloud agnostic approach to a cloud first approach. In conjunction with that shift, we entered into a strategic collaboration agreement with Amazon web services and embarked on significant development efforts to optimize our key products, to be efficiently deployed in the cloud through AWS, with an ultimate goal of exiting our two proprietary data centers and eventually deploying all of our SaaS clients in the public cloud. Over the past two years, we've made substantial progress under our cloud first approach. I'm pleased to report that we remain on target with our product development initiatives with an expectation that all of our major products will be cloud efficient or cloud optimized by the end of 2023 or early 2024. In addition, almost every product we've added through acquisition in the last several years has been cloud native. We've begun deploying some new SaaS clients in AWS, as well as lifting and shifting a limited number of existing SaaS clients out of our data centers and into AWS. We've made changes to sales compensation to encourage cloud sales over licenses. In early 2021, we also created a new cloud strategy and operations team, which has responsibility for our overall cloud transformation strategy and operations, including things like defining best practices for cloud development, operations, and deployment to achieve the full value of our cloud initiative. And as we've embraced the cloud first approach, our market has also continued to embrace the cloud at an increasing rate. In 2021, 71% of our new soft contract value came to us in the cloud with that percentage reaching 77% in the fourth quarter and conversions of existing on-premises clients of the cloud have also reached new highs in each of the last three quarters. So clearly our shift to the cloud is in sync with the market as clients recognize the many benefits of cloud based solutions. This acceleration of our cloud transition is continuing as we move into 2022. Effective January 1, 2022, some of our major products, including enterprise ERP powered by Munis and enterprise permitting and licensing powered by EnerGov will almost exclusively be offered to new clients as cloud solutions. Other applications will follow. We expect that the percentage of new clients choosing the cloud model will continue to grow significantly in 2022, with the exception of public safety. With today, there has been more market reluctance to move systems to the cloud. The general impacts of a SaaS transition on a software company financial model are generally understood. From a revenue perspective, there's an initial headwind as licensed revenue that is generally recognized up front is replaced by a recurring subscription revenue stream. And unlike licenses, that recurring revenue stream is not recognized in full immediately. Rather revenue recognition typically begins when customers go live with particular models, which can take several quarters. However, because the annual recurring revenues from a subscription client are approximately 1.8 to two times the annual maintenance, the same client would generate in a license deal, the SaaS revenue stream is significantly higher over the life of a client. Some extent we have experienced this headwind for several years, but the impact is increasing as the shift accelerates. Over the next several years, as Brian mentioned, license and maintenance revenue will continue to decline while subscriptions will accelerate. For example, in 2019 maintenance revenues were 45% higher than subscriptions. In 2022, subscriptions will surpass maintenance revenues. From a margin perspective, there are multiple short-term headwinds as well. License revenues have very high margins with immediate impact and as they decline, margins are negatively impacted until the subscription revenue stream reaches the point where it offsets those lost licenses. In addition, we will experience some margin headwood from bubble costs around the transition from our internal data centers to the AWS hosting environment. We can currently host almost all of our more than 5400 SaaS clients in one of two main proprietary data centers. We have certain fixed costs associated with running those data centers, even as we transition the hosting of new and existing clients to AWS. Until we completely exit one and ultimately both of our data centers, we will incur some duplicative costs that put pressure on margins. Once we are in AWS with products that are architected to operate more efficiently in the public cloud, we will see an uplift in margins. With that backdrop, I'd like to turn to a closer look at our outlook for 2022 and beyond. Our revenue growth outlook is solid representing the continuing return to and growth over pre pandemic levels and our increasing competitive position. The midpoint of our guidance would represent approximately 16% total growth and 9.5% organic growth, even in light of the continued accelerated shift of new business to SaaS. We expect that approximately 80% of our new software contract mix in 2022 will be SaaS. From a margin perspective, the midpoint of our 2022 guidance implies non-GAAP operating margin contraction of approximately 160 basis points. That said, our implied 2022 non-GAAP operating margin is consistent with or even slightly higher than our 2021 Q4 operating margin as the major factors impacting margins began before this year. I'd like to break down a few of those factors. The first material category of margin pressures we consider to be part of our long term strategy of becoming a cloud first company, the impact of the year over year increase in our SaaS business mix, net of on-premises conversions, along with increasing bubble cost in 2022 will negatively impact operating profit by approximately $28 million to $30 million. The second significant category of factors causing margin pressure is made up of costs and low margin revenues that experience reductions during the pandemic, but have been slowly returning since the end of last year, in which we've discussed on prior calls. These include trade shows, sales related travel costs, and some billable travel. Importantly, some costs have not, and will not return to pre COVID levels. The third category of factors include some one time or non-discretionary costs. We like virtually every company are experiencing the effects of labor market disruptions and increased wage pressure and healthcare costs also continue to rise as a result of healthcare inflation combined with the catch up of expenses from healthcare that were deferred during the pandemic. We've posted on our website with a supplemental quarterly data, a summary of these margin challenges. The estimated total impact of all these items accounts for approximately 290 basis points of operating margin impact in our 2022 outlook. Looking beyond 2022, we expect that our margins will continue to be impacted by some of these factors, particularly declining license revenues and cloud transition bubble costs. We believe that operating margin pressures from the cloud transition will bottom out in 2023 and that beginning in 2024, we will start to see accelerating revenue growth and return to margin expansion. The timing of the cloud transition varies by products as some products are further along creating something of an ebb and flow in the short term headwinds and long term tailwinds. For example, for enterprise ERP our largest and most profitable product, revenue growth slowed to approximately 8.5% in 2021, and is expected to grow a approximately 8% in 2022 as the mix of new business significantly shifted to SaaS. For example, in 2019, the new business mix was 50%. Fourth quarter last year, it was over 90%. However, the early expectations are for that product's growth to accelerate around 11% in 2023, as it begins to reach the other side of this transition and experience the SaaS uplift. As we head into 2022, I am more excited than ever about Tyler's future. It's amazing to think that it took 19 years from the time we entered the government technology market in 1998 to surpass $800 million in revenues in 2017 and in 2022, we will have added the next billion dollars of revenues in just five years. In 2017, recurring revenues accounted for 63% of total revenues. In 2022, they will exceed 80% and approach $1.5 billion dollars creating long-term value. We're executing on our strategic long-term cloud transition and we have an incredible platform as the clear leader in the massive public sector market. We have reorganized and aligned our Tyler payments team with NIC's payment team to further capitalize on this opportunity. Our elevated pre-pandemic investments are paying off as our market environment is strong and our competitive position and win rates across our core applications remain extremely high. One of our biggest assets is our existing client base with over 37,000 installations across more than 12,000 locations, something that takes decades to establish, and we are poised to take advantage of cross-selling and payment opportunities to accelerate growth and expand margins as we complete our transition to the cloud. With that, we'd like to open the line for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Matt VanVliet with BTIG. Please go ahead.
Matt VanVliet: Yeah, thanks for taking the question guys. Appreciate it. I guess, as you look at the commentary around the additional sales activity in RFPs, do you have a sense for how much the average budget is growing for the next 12 months or kind of on a go forward basis and how much of that can you attribute to the federal stimulus money finally sort of making its way into these budgets and people ready to allocate and spend those dollars?
Lynn Moore: Yeah, I don't have the percentage growth in government budgets at my fingertips, but the backdrop is strong. I would say that one of the -- obviously in public, in the local government, one of the biggest revenue streams is property taxes. Often that accounts for more than half of their budget and generally property values remain strong, real estate markets are strong, so there's not a lot of pressure there. So the overall environmental environment backdrop is strong and I would say that doesn't really include a lot of uplift from federal stimulus yet. We've seen, handful of deals this last quarter that were specifically identified as coming from or being funded with stimulus money. There's certainly some indirect funding that may not be used directly for a Tyler purchase that relieves pressures elsewhere in the budget and frees up funds for money they'd like to spend with Tyler. But in our view, the vast majority of the stimulus money has not yet been spent or even committed yet. With the Cares Act money they have until or the American Rescue plan money they've got until the end of 2024 to spend it and I think many governments are still in the very early stages of figuring out where they're going to spend that.
Matt VanVliet: All right. And then Brian, when we look at the, the guidance, I guess how much impact to the top line are you seeing in terms of headwinds from just the elevated SaaS mix coming through? So if we were to assume sort of the same level of mix from '21 into '22, how much of a lift would we see on that revenue number and then kind of secondarily to that, on the margin side, what is the underlying assumption for the core Tyler legacy business in terms of margin expansion, excluding some of these transition costs?
Lynn Moore: Yeah. The combination of the bubble costs, which are the incremental SaaS costs and the shift in the new mix is a combination of about $28 million to $30 million of impact on the op line on the revenue line and op related to the mix shift it's probably in the low teens, $12 million to $15 million of revenue impact from the increasing shift towards more SaaS.
Brian Miller: Yeah. I'd say it's and that's a combination of two numbers because you've got the -- when you're just talking about new business activity, it's, more in the $17 million to $18 million hit on the short term. At the same time, we are doing flips which gets some immediate impact offsetting some maintenance loss. But if you're talking about just the new business revenue growth, it's more in the $17 million, $18 million. When you offset flips, it comes down a little bit lower but there's also a cost that's associated with flips. Typically when we do a flip, we provide some services that we don't bill and that also creates some short term pressure on the margins that will not be there in the future.
Lynn Moore: So it's that impact of the mix shift is probably about a half point of margin for the year.
Operator: The next question is from Peter Heckmann with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.
Peter Heckmann: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple things, in the quarter were there any didn't sound like it, but were there any deals above $5 million in total contract value? And then in terms of, it's really encouraging to hear the cross sales so far, especially into the EGov base. I think you had done a little bit of qualification nine deals in the quarter, but is there any way to think about, quantifying the total value of bookings that Tyler may have added since the close of the EnerGov selling into current EnerGov customers?
Lynn Moore: I'll take the first part of that? No, there were not any deals this quarter that had a total contract value of more than $5 million. Our largest one was a little under $4.5 million. We had a lot of deals in the, the $1 million to $3 million range, but no, none of those mega deals this quarter and we did in the fourth quarter of last year as we pointed out.
Brian Miller: Yeah. I think I'd add, you talking about the cross selling, that's one of our largest opportunities in our core applications and every time we do acquisitions, it's real exciting to see the things that are going on within IC right now in our other divisions. One of the things that we didn't point out in our prepared comments was a very specific deal of the nine that we talked about. And this was a deal that NIC helped using their state enterprise contracts, state contacts with the State of Arkansas where we got a vend engine deal where vend engine is going to be handling all the online and phone bank deposits in the state-wide corrections contract. That's about $800,000 in ARR and what's I think what's particularly exciting for me is NIC is a company that we acquired in April and VendEngine is a company that we acquired in September and in the first quarter those two teams got together as part, we've talked in the past about some of the efforts we were doing around sales and education, and we're able to already get a deal of this size. I think it's an example of the tip iceberg of where we can go. Not only with NIC, but all the other acquisitions that we do for strategic purposes and again, it's pretty exciting.
Peter Heckmann: Yeah. That's incredible and it sounds as if the more near term opportunity is selling Tyler Solutions into EGov base and that might be a little easier just based upon how their portal contracts are kind of like hunting licenses but, longer term, do you see some cross sells the other way, either payments or certain applications that that NIC has developed that you might be able to sell in municipalities?
Lynn Moore: Yeah, I think, that's fair. I also, going back to the NIC strategy, I remember a year and a half ago when I was talking with the business leaders about this deal, I said, show me why this deal is good for Tyler, but also show me why Tyler's good for NIC, and I just gave the example of the vintage in Arkansas deal, but I also gave examples in my prepared remarks about how D&I really was a significant contributor in getting South Carolina in a very competitive rebid against Deloitte and also an early extension of this Texas payments contracts. So that's an example where we provided value to NIC really out of the gate. I do think as we continue, you talk about payments yes, like you look at the State of Florida, we're going to help expand that payments revenue by having that hunting license and going through our local contact. We put our payments teams together and today I generally just consider it Tyler, it's one payments organization. I don't really distinguish between NIC and Tyler anymore, but certainly they were much more mature. They were the payments leader and, and I think we're helping there as well.
Brian Miller: And of the nine combined sell through deals this quarter, one of them was a payments deal with NIC payments with a Tyler local government client in Louisiana.
Peter Heckmann: Okay, great. I appreciate it.
Operator: The next question is from Terry Tillman with Truist. Please go ahead, Terry. Your line is open on our end. Is it possibly muted on yours?
UnidentifiedAnalyst: Thank you very much. This is Joe [ph] on for Terry. Thanks for taking the question. Just acknowledging that bookings can be lumpy and trillion 12 month view helps smooth things out, but I'm just curious about the bookings in 4Q, how that played out versus your expectations?
Lynn Moore: I'd say generally pretty much in line with our X expectations. One of the things, we've talked about the recovery in the market that over the last year, we've consistently talked about activity, sort of leading indicators of activity in the market. The number of RFPs we're seeing, the number of sales demos we're doing, those things continuing to rebound and trend back towards and in many cases above pre COVID levels. But you have to keep in mind that our sales cycles are long and it's not uncommon that a deal from the time that process really gets started to the time we sign a contract can be a year, year and a half. So there's a lag between a lot of the time that activity starts to, to ramp up and the time it shows up in booking. So generally we're pretty pleased. There's always some deals that fly out of the quarter, but nothing really terribly unusual this quarter. And the progress in the booking is I think in line with our expectations given that activity we've seen over the last few quarters.
UnidentifiedAnalyst: Great. Thanks. And then if you could just comment on ERP demand through 2022 and how that looks going into '23. Thanks so much.
Brian Miller: Yeah, I think the ERP demand is like everything else and across the company. I talked earlier about, demos are, are at all time, high, RFPs are up. The number of deals that we're signing particularly at our enterprise platform is approaching really pre-pandemic levels. At the lower end at our, at our ERP pro, our win rates are at all-time highs. The growth is really is really good. It has been really for, it's been good for the last several quarters and really the last year and a half or two years. So I think the demand is still pretty robust out there.
Operator: The next question is from Charlie Strauzer with CJS Securities. Please go ahead.
Charlie Strauzer: Hi. Good morning. Just two quick questions real quick on the AWS progress. Are you currently are you -- when you sign up a new SaaS customer, are you currently putting them on AWS? Are you still putting them on legacy systems and then migrating them over?
Lynn Moore: Yeah, that's sort of still depends a little bit by product. So new customers in our ERP side particularly in our civic and our powered by Munis, those new customers are going to be going in AWS, but you have to remember, we're still in the process of getting all of our core applications into a cloud efficient state. So, even the new customers that we sign that going to AWS, we're not going to be experiencing the higher margin that we will be, as soon as we get these products more efficient in the cloud.
Charlie Strauzer: That makes sense and obviously we talked about some of the expenses and migration lasting it into next year. Do you think that's kind of first half of next year, full year, how should we think about the progression of that that decline of away from the,
Brian Miller: Oh, I'd say that it's pretty consistent throughout the year. We'd expect that impact to continue on through the year.
Charlie Strauzer: Got it. And then just lastly, Brian, I apologize if you gave us that earlier, but in the guidance any guidance for cash flow?
Brian Miller: We do not guide the cash flow. We give a lot of in the press release. There's a lot of information around depreciation, amortization capitalization that can help you get to that number, but we don't specifically guide to cash flow.
Operator: The next question, if from Scott Berg with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.
Scott Berg: Hi, everyone. Congrats on the good quarter and thanks for too my question. Lynn just to start off with a statement, you sound like you could be a CFO in your next life nice job with all those numbers there. Yeah, I guess I wanted to…
Lynn Moore: I'm known for my own spread sheets, Alex.
Scott Berg: It's also impressive because I think your background as an attorney, if I remember correctly too, so double whammy there. That's fantastic. I guess wanted to start by tackling fiscal '22 margins from a slightly different angle. As we think about the fall off in NIC revenues this year, kind of the two part question, there is one, how much are NIC revenues pressuring margins this year versus the core kind of organic Tyler business, because you didn't lay that out in the slide necessarily on the website. And then secondly, as some of those COVID revenues fall off in the first half, given what those margins look like, should we get maybe a little bit of upward opportunity and margins, with a fall off of those revenues?
Lynn Moore: Yeah I'll start Scott. I think you'll see throughout the year our margin will increase some throughout the year and as we are losing some of those COVID revenues in some of the areas, I believe it's in South Carolina and Nevada our role in those COVID revenues has changed from a prime to a sub. So while those revenues drop off the margins actually get a little bit better. And so I think really at a high level NIC's contribution is somewhat consistent with Tyler's overall margin for next year.
Scott Berg: Got it helpful. And then from a sorry, go ahead Brian.
Brian Miller: I was just going to say, yeah, the second half margins do step up from the first half as the NIC COVID revenues decline, but in general NIC's revenues or margins in 2022 are fairly close to in line with Tyler's.
Scott Berg: Got it helpful. And then from a follow up question around the SaaS transition, you all seem significantly more confident in your ability to sell that obviously today, given what your recent successes are, but Brian, I remember talking historically over the last couple years is your largest of customers still had some hesitancy to adopt a subscription model for a variety of different reasons. I think in Lynn's remarks, your expectations around Munis virtually all of those deals to go subscription this year and of course Munis is one of those products you've also had an opportunity or growing opportunity at market. Should we see those large Munis deals also go subscription this year? Or is that something that might push into, maybe '23 or '24?
A – Brian Miller: I think we're seeing it across all tiers of the market. And that includes in the ERP space. I think last quarter 90% of Munis' deals were SaaS deals. So the upper end of the market is I think just as willing to go SaaS as the lower end and maybe in some cases more so, and we certainly had success across other products. For example, North Carolina a couple years ago in the odysey side on the courts was our biggest SaaS contract to date. And we've seen some large customers on the appraisal and tax side selecting SaaS. So I think it's across all tiers of the market.
Lynn Moore: Yeah, I think Scott, I'd add that, we've communicated to the Munis client base the direction and you're going to see more around this in, I think it's April when we have our Tyler user conference connect, you're going to see a significant, more focus on our shift to the cloud and the expectation really and the messaging is really, is that pretty much almost all new business up to that end will be going into the cloud. And as Brian mentioned, it was already over 90% in Q4 last year, which, if you go back three years ago, it had just gotten to 50-50. So it's been moving in that direction for some time.
Operator: The next question is from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Alex Zukin: Hey guys. So just a couple for me, I guess, help us understand, because it does feel like again, you're at a high level, you're guiding to organic revenue growth acceleration next year, and you grew organic bookings 11.5% this year outside of the headwinds, obviously from the cloud transition stuff. Put that into context and just drive home maybe if you will, A, when was the last time you guided to accelerating growth and what are some of the sustainable, trends that you're seeing in the business that give you that confidence?
Lynn Moore: Yeah, well, I think you're right. It's funny. I was, I talk sometimes in my personal life about the last couple years in COVID and sometimes I sort of call them as quote, the lost years and I try to -- I was trying to remember how things happened and I almost put everything in reference to, well, it was pre COVID or post COVID. But what I was thinking about this the other day, but at Tyler, these haven't been lost years. We've been working hard and we've been investing and we knew that this market was going to be rebounding. And we talked about it as COVID started about, we went back to the great recession and we had that great big boost out of coming outta the great recession. And we were anticipating this and we planned for it, we invested in it and at the same time made our investments into the cloud, and I think seeing the market return, yes, the stimulus money's out there. I think the local state and local government budgets are very robust. I think we're in our competitive position across all our products is an all-time high. We are at the point now where I'm starting to see the coming out of the other side of the SaaS transition. It's not happening tomorrow. It's not happening in the next couple of quarters, but my reference to what's going on at for example, up at Munis and we see the uplift that's coming from that. And so that's the stuff that gives me confidence. The acquisitions that we're doing, the cross selling that's going on, the interactions that's going on with our teams, one thing we've been focused on really a lot in the last few years is an idea that I call one Tyler and that's it's, it's not where our enterprise group and we're all together, and we're all pushing in the same direction and there's opportunities that we need to start tapping into more and more, and we're starting to see this in deals and we've done it very successfully for a long time. But as I say, our greatest assets are customer base. It doesn't take years to develop. It takes decades to develop and the opportunities we have there with our new products, as we move to SaaS, as we continue to do acquisitions things like vend engine USC direct, there's just -- there's so many opportunities out there and I just like where we sit right now, and as you can tell, I get a little excited. I think a year ago, I was talking about cautious optimism, and then I was talking about tempered excitement. And I think right now, I'm just flat out excited about the future. We're going to have a -- we're going to see some ripples for our financials over the next two years as the SaaS transition goes on, but we're making significant progress and we know where we're going to be on the other side.
Alex Zukin: That's super helpful. I guess let's talk about my next question's about those ripples. And I apologize, it'll be a little bit of a multi-part question, but I want, when you talked about subscription revenues, ex, the COVID points being over 30%, I want to ask, if we think about this SaaS transition, what's the durability of that 30% plus subscription revenue growth? And then on the margin side, I think you guys did a wonderful job laying out the costs -- the cost hit that you're taking this year and bridging the margins on a like for like basis without it. Is this the year that margins trough in the business and then next as you absorb those bubble costs, as you absorb the comeback COVID costs, and then in '23, you start to come, go back to seeing margin leverage, or is this transition going to, kind of peg margins at this level for a few years?
Lynn Moore: I'll start, I'll let Brian jump in. I think, margins will trough may be the right word or sort of balance out at this level through 2023. And I think you'll start to see the uplift coming out of there. On your question around subscriptions and the uplift of course, embedded in our subscription line is also transaction based revenues. Those, will grow not at the same rate as some of our subscriptions, which is just coming in with our SaaS contracts. We talked about on the call, we've grown in double digits 56 quarters out of 64 quarters. We've been consistently at 20% plus. And I think as we make the transition and start coming out on the other side, I think you'll start seeing that. We talked about a few milestones in my prepared comments. One of the things that's also exciting me when I look at our mix of recurring revenue versus where it was five years ago, and you talk about our growth, it took us from 1998 to 2019 to get to a billion dollars in total revenues. And in 2022, I think we're going to do right at about a billion dollars in subscriptions alone. That's part of the excitement that I see and I see that continuing to grow at a pretty healthy clip in the near future.
A – Brian Miller: And I would just point out that, that mid to high 30 subscription growth, it excludes the COVID related revenues, but it is not an organic number. So it also includes a full year of NIC. On organic basis, it would be more around the mid 20%, so 24%, 25% which is more consistent with I think what's sort of a sustainable in the near to midterm kind of growth in subscriptions.
Alex Zukin: Got it. That's super helpful. Thank you guys and congrats.
Operator: The next question is from Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Brent Bracelin: Good morning and thank you for taking the question here. Obviously super encouraging to see government appetite to embrace cloud. I think the impact did you accelerate those transitions are very clear and well known and well understood. I wanted to double click into the cross opportunity around payments specifically around going into the existing installed base of Tyler software customers that potentially are using a different payment source and really convincing that base of customer to add on payments. Is the assertion point primarily upon a renewal. Is there a shorter sales cycle potentially to add on payments or and do you have a dedicated team now that is going in and trying to cross sell upsell existing Tyler software payments, little more color just around that opportunity. It seems like it's a very big opportunity encouraged by the nine deals. You talked about bundling those sound more like new deals. Love to get some color around being, trying to your success upselling the install base. Thanks.
Lynn Moore: No, that's a good question, Brent. I think, you actually, you asked a number of questions in there. I'll try to get to the ones I recall, if I'd missed one, just come back to at me. The sales side will vary a little bit with payments and some of that will be dependent upon the customer and payments, there's a number of things that can impact that the current providers that our clients might be using is one. But you're right. It is one of our larger opportunities and payments while we've got some great new ground with NIC and for example, the Florida contract and going locally, it's one of the focuses and emphasis, for example, we talked, there's been a lot of questions about what's going on with Munis on this call. It's considered to be one of their primary key growth drivers in the next few years is payments. And there's a significant amount of dedicated resources that are focused on that. And going back into that installed channel. So you're exactly right there. What we bring with NIC in terms of payments and our now more complete solution I think is something that's pretty important. One thing that we had really built out was electronic bill presentment and payment, and that's a very, very big differentiator in the market. And it's something that NIC was not as strong at and obviously they were very strong with their payment engine and gateway stuff, things that we needed to build. I think we've talked before where we both brought strengths here. We've got the ability through our connections with our proprietary products, either you be in tax collections, and we've got those relationships and we can start going to drive those sales. And so, you're right. It's one of our larger strategic initiatives. It's getting a lot of attention and focus. I mentioned how we just recently reorganized the internally the payments organization bringing, 45 payment org resources within Tyler and getting them aligned with the NIC resources working on go to market strategies looking at the size of the market, and so it's something that we are, I can assure you we're actively pursuing.
Brent Bracelin: Great, super helpful color there. And just one follow up on, on the go to market for payments, is the intent that each major, it sounds like these now five solution categories would have their own dedicated payments team, or do you actually have an overlay payments sales team to go in and try to upsell cross sell?
Lynn Moore: Yeah, I think it's the latter right now. And there are certain parts of our business where payments will be a bigger focus. It obviously trickles through a lot of our different core applications. We'll be focusing on certain ones more out of the gate and as we continue to capitalize on that opportunity, we'll continue to expand.
Brent Bracelin: Got it. Very clear. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from [indiscernible] with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey this is Aduvaid [ph] here asking a question on behalf of Kirk. Just two questions. First I know he's been a really big year from an R&A perspective but how are you thinking about the pace of M&A going forward, and then I know you talked a little bit about the transition to AWS, but could you touch a little bit about on the just the incremental costs associated with the transition?
Lynn Moore: Sure. I'll, start, M&A is part of our history. It's something we've done since 1998. I think we've done 50 acquisitions over the 23 plus years I've been here and it's something that we continually look at. We have done a, a fair number. We did five last year. We just closed another one. Excuse me, those take significant amount of internal resources. But I think as we look forward we're going to continue to look at opportunities and when we find something compelling and that's strategic, we're going to execute on it. I mentioned last year, obviously the NIC deal and I've made my comments where there were some other deals in the pipeline. USC directs a good example. This was something that was not in the pipeline last year. We talked about a little at higher bar. I think we probably had a little bit higher bar right now. But I'm also comfortable with where we sit with our balance sheet in our debt. We paid down $395 million last year. Our net leverage is right around two give or take a little bit. So in my view, we're in a position to execute on any strategic initiative and if it's a compelling M&A opportunity we're going to do it.
Brian Miller: And your question about the AWS transition costs, I guess what we refer to as the bubble costs or those incremental SaaS transition costs in 2022 will be in the $16 million to $18 million range. So, somewhere around 90 basis points of operating margin impact.
Operator: The next question is from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Trevor [ph] filling in for Keith. I had a quick question about NIC. So the core revenue growth for the quarter was a little bit less than we expected. Is driver history records being impacted the slowdown in new car sales?
Brian Miller: Yes, they are. That is the one of the bigger drivers of those revenue streams, which are a significant part of NIC's transaction revenues in many states. And one of the drivers of that is new car sales which trigger a insurance event. And so those have been affected in recent quarters by the slowness in new car sales as a result of supply chain issues.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And then a quick follow up sticking with NIC you kind of touched on this a little bit earlier, but could you share the biggest success story so far and the acquisition and maybe any revenue synergies that you've achieved?
Lynn Moore: Well, I think the biggest success story, well, I could probably talk for another hour. I think the biggest success story has been bringing in their team and seeing how their team aligns with our team and seeing our teams work together, executing on our out of the gate strategy in 2021, them continuing to deliver on their business while we also sat and outlined a number of strategic initiatives which are pretty wide and diverse across Tyler. We talked about it on this call, a couple of deals that were really joint deals that we're -- that may not have happened. Or certainly the timing of it may not have happened had we not been together the vend engine deal, great example the extension of Tyler -- of Texas payments by three years because of D&I, huge success story beating in a very, very competitive rebid in South Carolina, which is a $10 million ARR client and beating out them and using Tyler and the story of Tyler and D&I involved in that. Those are all success stories, and I almost get to the point it's you're almost asking me who's my favorite kid. There's a lot of them out there.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thanks a lot. And congrats on the quarter.
Operator: At this time, there appear to be no more questions. Mr. Moore, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Gary. And thanks everybody for joining us today. We hope you stay safe and healthy, and if you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Brian Miller or myself. Thanks everybody.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-28 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello. And welcome to today’s Tyler Technologies Third Quarter 2021 Conference Call. Your host for today’s call is Lynn Moore, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, October 28, 2021. Lynn Moore, please go ahead.
Lynn Moore: Thank you, Jason, and welcome to our call. With me today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I’d like for Brian to give the Safe Harbor statement. Next, I’ll have some comments on our quarter and then Brian will review the details of our results. I’ll end with some additional comments and then we’ll take questions. Brian?
Brian Miller: Thanks, Lynn.

Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Lynn?
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. Our third quarter results were exceptionally strong, building on the momentum we established in the first half of the year. This was our first full quarter including NICs results and it was our best quarter ever by most financial measures. We achieved new quarterly highs and revenues, non-GAAP EPS, free cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, bookings and backlog. Total revenues grew 60.9%, with organic growth of 7.6%. As a result of the surge in the Delta variant, NIC’s COVID-19 related revenues from TourHealth and Pandemic Unemployment initiatives were significantly above plan at $43.3 million. We had expected those revenues which have relatively low margins to wind down in the second half of the year. But we now expect they will continue into the first half of 2022. NIC’s core revenues grew 5% in the quarter. Recurring revenues comprised over 80% of our quarterly revenues for the first time and were led by 183% growth in subscription revenues. Excluding NIC revenues, subscription revenue growth was robust at 23.9%, reflecting our accelerating shift to the cloud. We have now achieved greater than 20% subscription revenue growth in 55 quarters of the last 63 quarters. Software licenses and services revenues grew 13.9% or 2% excluding NIC. As expected, our margins compressed compared to last year third quarter. Some expenses like tradeshows and employee health claims, as well as lower margin revenues like billable travel that declined in 2020 due to COVID pandemic have begun to return this year. Margins were also impacted by the inclusion of NIC and particularly by the continuation of their lower margin COVID initiative revenues. As a result, our non-GAAP operating margin declined 330 basis points to 25.3%. Excluding NICs COVID initiative revenues and related costs, our non-GAAP operating margin was 26.8%. Bookings reached a record high in third quarter at approximately $601 million, more than double last year third quarter. Excluding NIC, bookings grew 51.9%, with the biggest contributor being the $63 million renewal of our fixed fee e-filing arrangement with the State of Illinois. We’re very pleased to report early success this quarter with joint sales efforts between NIC and Tyler Solutions teams. We signed agreements with the Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development valued at approximately $24 million to provide a digital and call center solution for tenant, landlord and third-party filing of Rent Relief Program claims. We will also provide Administrative Dashboards from our Socrata Data & Insight solutions, as well as payment processing capabilities. Our largest software deal the quarter also came from NIC with $6.1 million SaaS contract with the West Virginia Division of Motor Vehicles for digital titling. This new digital vehicle titling and registration management system will go beyond modernization and revolutionize how the DMV manages vehicles and interacts with businesses and citizens. In addition to the streamlining of nearly every vehicle related process in place today, many legacy paper processes will be fully replaced with secure digital solutions. The solution utilizes technology to govern and secure the vehicle ownership process, adding security, reducing fraud and providing the flexibility that other state DMVs operations are lacking. The arrangement, which leverages our State Master Agreement has an initial term of five years. In addition to the SaaS fees, the agreement will generate estimated transaction revenue of more than $3 million per year. I’d like to also highlight a few more significant deals sign this quarter. We signed Appraisal Services contracts with the Delaware counties of Newcastle and Kent. In addition, Newcastle County selected our iasWorld Appraisal Solution under a SaaS arrangement. The deals have a combined value of approximately $19 million. Coupled with the Appraisal Services contract signed last quarter with Sussex County. Tyler will now be performing a property reassessment for the entire state. Also for our iasWorld Property Tax and Appraisal Solution, we signed SaaS arrangements with the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo in Alberta, Canada, valued at approximately $3.1 million. Franklin County, Ohio valued at approximately $3.5 million and Summit County, Ohio, which also includes our Data & Insights Solution, valued at approximately $2.9 million. Other major SaaS deals included a $4.5 million contract with Arlington Heights, Illinois for our ERP Civic Services and Payment Solutions, and a $3.4 million contract with Bayer County, Texas for our Odyssey, SoftCode and Supervision Justice Solutions. Our largest perpetual license contract of the quarter was a $5.4 million contract to provide our MicroPact Entellitrak Solution to manage COVID vaccination adaptations for the U.S. Department of Justice. We also signed a $2.5 million on-premises license contract with the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands for our Munis ERP and Enterprise Asset Management, ExecuTime and Socrata Solutions. We also signed several significant contract renewals with existing clients, including extensions of NIC’s State Enterprise Agreements with the States of Utah and Oklahoma, and a five-year renewal of our e-filing arrangement with the State of Illinois, which was expanded to include applications from our Socrata Data & Insights platform. On last quarter’s call, we reported that NIC had been selected as one of two vendors to provide the Internal Revenue Service with a Digital Payment Processing Solution that would allow taxpayers to securely pay their federal taxes and that revenue under that contract was expected to begin in January of 2022. Following the award, three entities filed protests with the GAO. Prior to any ruling on the protest by the GAO, the IRS notified the GAO that it was canceling the two awards, including the award to NIC. While the IRS has not formally terminated NIC’s contract, it has issued a stop work order under the contract. The IRS indicated that it will either amend the current solicitation, allowing all bidders to modify their previous submissions and then reevaluate the proposals or terminate the existing solicitation and start the process over with a new procurement in the coming months. The IRS has not yet stated which of these options it will select and we have no information regarding the potential timing of either option. Given these recent developments, we do not expect to recognize any revenue under the IRS award in 2022. While the specific concerns raised in the protests have not been made public and are not known by Tyler, the decision to cancel the award to NIC was not related to NIC’s performance under the contract, its ability to successfully perform under the contract or any allegations of misconduct or improper behavior by NIC. On the M&A front, we completed the acquisitions of VendEngine and Arx during the third quarter. VendEngine is one of the fastest growing technology companies in North America, operating in more than 230 counties and 32 states. Its leading cloud-based platform provides a comprehensive suite of applications focused on the corrections market, including deposit technologies for commissary, ordering and warehouse management, and various informational electronic communications, security, accounting and financial trust management components. Arx is a cloud-based software platform which creates accessible technology to enable a modern day police force that is fully transparent, accountable and a trusted resource to the community it serves. The acquisition of Arx allows Tyler to offer a full suite of Public Safety Solutions, including Arx Alert and Arx Community, designed to maximize efficiency and safety for law enforcement officers, while increasing transparency and trust building with communities. VendEngine and Arx have combined ARR of approximately $17.5 million and their additions further strengthened Tyler’s justice and Public Safety suites. Now, I’d like for Brian to provide more details on results of the quarter.
Brian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2021. In our earnings release, we’ve included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We’ve also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financial Reports tab schedules with supplemental information provides on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. GAAP revenues for the quarter were $459.9 million, up 60.9%. Non-GAAP revenues were $460.6 million, up 61.1%. On an organic basis GAAP and non-GAAP revenues grew 7.6% and 7.5%, respectively. Software license revenues rose 13.7%. Subscription revenues rose 183.3%. Excluding the contribution from NIC subscription revenues were still very strong, growing 23.9%. We added 144 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 67 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $84 million in total contract value. In Q3 of last year, we added 114 new subscription-based arrangements and had 46 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $56 million in total contract value. Subscription contract value comprised approximately 74% of total new software contract value signed this quarter, compared to 47% in Q3 of last year, reflecting our ongoing shift to a cloud first approach to sales. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 3.4 years, compared to 4.3 years last year. Transaction based revenues which include NIC portal, payment processing and e-filing revenues and are included in subscriptions were $171.2 million, up more than six-fold from last year. E-filing revenues reached a new high of $17.4 million, up to 15%. Excluding NIC, Tyler’s transaction-based revenues grew 24.3%. For the third quarter, our annualized non-GAAP total recurring revenue or ARR was approximately $1.5 billion, up 79.2%, non-GAAP ARR for SaaS software arrangements for Q3 was approximately $330 million, up to 24.7%, transaction-based ARR was approximately $685 million, up 639% and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was flat at approximately $471 million. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $1.77 billion, up to 14.3%. Because the vast majority of NIC’s revenues are transaction based, their backlog at quarter end was only $27 million. Excluding the addition of NIC, Tyler’s backlog grew 12.6%. As Lynn noted, our bookings in the quarter were very robust at $601 million, up 105.7% and includes the transaction-based revenues of NIC. On an organic basis, bookings were strong at approximately $40 -- $444 million, up 51.9%, fueled by the renewal of the State of Illinois fixed fee e-filing arrangement of approximately $63 million and the addition of the two Delaware appraisal deals totaling $19 million. For the trailing 12 months bookings were approximately $1.6 billion, up 31.3% and on an organic basis were approximately $1.4 billion, up 10.8%. Our software subscription bookings in the third quarter added $19 million in new annual recurring revenue. Cash from operations and free cash flow were both record highs for the third quarter at $205.4 million and $192.8 million, respectively. Our balance sheet remains very strong. During the quarter we repaid the outstanding balance of $65 million on our revolver and paid down $57.5 million on our term loans for a total debt reduction of $122.5 million. We ended the quarter with total outstanding debt of $1.428 billion in cash and investments of $348.4 million and net leverage of approximately 2.3 times trailing pro forma EBITDA. We expect the net leverage to be approximately 2 times by year end. We have raised our revenue and EPS guidance for the full year 2021 to reflect our strong year-to-date performance and our expectations for the fourth quarter. We expect 2021 total GAAP revenues will be between $1.577 billion and $1.597 billion and non-GAAP total revenues will be between $1.580 billion and $1.6 billion. We expect total revenues will include approximately $72 million of COVID-related revenues from NIC’s TourHealth and Pandemic Unemployment Services that are expected to wind down in the first half of 2022. We expect 2021 GAAP diluted EPS will be between $3.55 and $3.63, and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $6.94 and $7.02. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release. Now, I’d like to turn the call back over to Lynn.
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. I’m extremely pleased with our third quarter results, both from Tyler’s core operations and from NIC and its first full quarter as part of Tyler. When we spoke to investors in June, we discussed four priorities around the NIC acquisition for 2021. First, don’t mess up the business. Second, achieve our 2021 plans for both businesses. Third, retain NIC staff and establish the long-term leadership team. And fourth, identify and launch joint strategic initiatives and get our sales teams aligned. I’m happy to say we are executing on all of those objectives. Both businesses are executing at a high level and are exceeding our 2021 plans. The NIC team under the leadership of Elizabeth Proudfit is enthusiastic about the combination and the opportunities ahead with Tyler. And we’ve hit the ground running, with teams actively working on integration and go-to-market strategies. We’re showcasing Tyler products to NIC’s entire state general manager team and NIC’s general managers are providing detailed reviews of the NIC state enterprise contracts and relationships for Tyler’s team. We’ve also established a payments technology integration plan and are in the process of finalizing the joint Tyler/NIC payments organization. We’ve already had some early success and join opportunities, such as our contract with the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies that includes NIC Payment Processing, Tyler’s Entellitrak Regulatory Solutions and our Socrata Data & Insights platform, as well as the recent NIC contract with Virginia for solution for the Rent Relief Program, which also includes Tyler’s Socrata applications. We have a current pipeline of more than 40 qualified sell-through opportunities with NIC’s state enterprise market across multiple Tyler solutions and have identified Tyler sales opportunities leveraging NIC state enterprise contracts to speed up the time from award to contract. We’re also beginning to build our combined payments pipeline, with early sales in Florida and Louisiana. We continue to see positive trends in public sector market activity. Indicators such as proposals, sales demonstrations and pipelines are all up significantly from 2020 and are generally at or in some cases above pre-COVID levels. Our competitive -- our competitiveness remains strong as reflected by high win rates across our major applications. Well, not yet a significant factor. We’re starting to see purchasing activity that has identified is being funded through the federal stimulus under the CARES Act and the American Rescue Plan. We expect that the $350 billion of aid to state and local governments, and $167 billion of aid to schools under the American Rescue Plan Act will provide a significant measure of relief to budget pressures faced by many of our clients and prospects, and potentially provide a tailwind over the next two years to three years. A survey by the National Association of CIOs indicated that most state CIOs expect that remote work will continue and the need for digital services will increase. CIOs also said they plan to modernize legacy systems in the next two years, with human services and public welfare, labor and employment and health services notice priorities. Tyler is well-positioned to help public sector leaders address those needs. We also remain on track with our R&D projects around our cloud initiative and with our progress toward hosting new SaaS implementations and on-premises conversions in AWS. Our cloud operation team is engaged in 2022 planning, with a focus on continued product optimization, data center migration and operations maturity. Finally, I want to welcome the newest member of Tyler’s executive leadership team, Kevin Iwersen, who joined Tyler earlier this month as Chief Information Officer. Kevin is a seasoned IT leader with experience managing technology infrastructures for corporations, statewide judicial courts, statewide executive government agencies and U.S. military organizations, most recently serving as CIO for the Idaho Judicial Branch. Kevin will work closely with our former CIO, Matt Bieri, until Matt’s retirement early next year. I’d also like to express our deep appreciation to Matt for his tremendous leadership of our IT and hosting organization over the last 11 years and wish him the best in his retirement. With that, we’d like to open up the line for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt VanVliet from BTIG. Please go ahead.
Matt VanVliet: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question and nice job on the quarter. I guess pertaining to the commentary that was in both the press release and you’ve talked about this morning in terms of some of the stimulus funding finally sort of making its way into the market. Wondering if you could give us some additional color in terms of where you’re seeing some of that coming through now, where are some of the newer sales activities pertaining to jurisdictions that feel like they have more budget to spend and maybe you are looking at nice to have types of projects and anything additionally around types of products that they’re most interested in terms of using that funding? Thanks.
Lynn Moore: Yeah. Sure. Matt, It’s a good question. It’s something that we’re starting to track a little bit more. I’d say, you’re seeing it really across a lot of our solutions. But I think we’ve seen a lot really on the enterprise side. We’re seeing a little bit in schools and we’ve seen some over on NIC. I think right now, if you look at Q3 and Q4, there are a few dozen deals out there that that are certainly being spurred right now through some of that federal stimulus spending and I’d expect some of that to continue.
Matt VanVliet: Great. Thanks. And then following up, I guess, on the exact sort of contribution of what the NIC business is looking like in the guidance for kind of the full year what the contribution looks like, understanding that some of that was one-time. But Brian, if you could help us just kind of what the underlying core business is contributing there and kind of what the growth continues to look like on a forward basis? Thanks.
Brian Miller: Yeah. So exploiting NIC, the current guidance would have Tyler’s forecasts, I guess, the midpoint of our guidance would be around a $1.224 billion revenues and that would be the midpoint around 9.5% growth for the full year and that would imply, again, at the midpoint of our guidance around 11% growth for the core Tyler operations in the fourth quarter. And NIC, as we had discussed, the COVID-related initiative revenues have continued beyond when we thought even at the end of last quarter, they would wind down. We had at the end of last quarter our guidance had about $17 million for the second half of the year and we did $43 million under those initiatives in Q3 and now expect the full year to be about $72 million, so about another $13 million or so in the fourth quarter and some of that then continuing on into next year. But NIC’s core growth excluding this core -- the COVID initiatives was around 5% in the fourth quarter, I’m sorry, in the third quarter. And there’s some seasonality in their fourth quarter core operations, particularly around the holidays and some of the transaction volumes tend to fall in the fourth quarter. So their fourth quarter probably is what our guidance reflects that in the fourth quarter numbers.
Matt VanVliet: Great. Thanks for all the color. I appreciate taking the question.
Operator: The next question comes from Scott Berg from Needham & Company. Please go ahead.
Scott Berg: Hi, Lynn and Brian. Congrats on a really good quarter here. I guess I get several questions is, bookings were quite strong in the quarter especially excluding NIC. Lynn, if we dissect those a little bit, how much of the bookings in the quarter are maybe catch up deals that were pushed from the earlier stages of the pandemic just into the current period or you kind of seen more of a return to a normalized deal cadence here, which you’ve been enjoying for the last decade or so?
Lynn Moore: Yeah. I think it’s a combination of a couple things, Scott. We did have a couple of very large deals that we signed in the quarter, which obviously were absent in Q3. Q3 was difficult last year. But I think, as I mentioned in my comments, when you look at the market activity and what I’ve talked about over the last several quarters is, over the last 18 months or so the pandemic is sort of affected different parts of our business a little bit differently. Some were hit a little bit harder and I think I’ve mentioned before that if you look at, for example, our mid-to-higher end financials are Munis product. That was an area that was hit a little bit harder and what you’re seeing there, for example, is you’re seeing awards and deals that are actually exceeding pre-COVID levels and I think that’s the example of what you just mentioned, which is, it’s really the example that both pent-up activity, as well as I think, sort of validate some of the investments and some of the strategy that we’ve been doing over the last couple years.
Scott Berg: Excellent. Thanks. And then from a follow up perspective, Brian, on the guidance for the year, if I back out the added revenues expected from NIC, it looks like your core Tyler guidance is roughly flat for the year. How are you thinking about kind of deal mix around subscription versus license deals, because the bookings were certainly strong, I guess, I would have maybe expected a little bit more increase in kind of the core Tyler revenues, but that’s probably related to maybe stronger subscription bookings mix than maybe what you’re previously expecting?
Brian Miller: Yeah. I’d say that’s accurate. We’re generally expecting the mix to continue to trend toward an increasing percentage of SaaS. Now, the fourth quarter, as you know, typically is a strong quarter for Public Safety, which still is primarily on-premises and so that tempers that a bit, but that also was the case last year. But, in general, we expect an ongoing continuation of the trends we’ve seen where a higher percentage of the mix is SaaS.
Lynn Moore: Yeah. I think I’d add there, Scott, that it’s -- the amount of SaaS is actually, even exceeded our going into year expectations and while we expected the market to be moving this way, we talked before the pandemic has certainly accelerated that. And you look at areas, I’ll mention, Munis again, I mean, we’re north of 85% of our deals are SaaS now, you look at our lower end financials and in code north of 80%, while last year they were 50%. So there is some of that headwind. I think as the model continues to play out, we’ll get on the other side of that.
Scott Berg: Excellent. Thanks for the color. Great quarter guys.
Operator: The next question comes from Ethan Bruck from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Alex Zukin: Hey, guys. It’s -- I think this is -- it’s Alex here from Wolfe. So a couple questions for me. First, if we think about the, I wanted to ask about the maintenance revenue in the quarter, the maintenance revenue was, I think, a down a bit sequentially. Are you starting to see -- is that conversion activity starting to pick up a little bit and how should we think about it in Q4 and beyond?
Brian Miller: Yeah. I think that’s accurate. So each of the last couple of quarters have been new all-time highs for us in terms of the number of conversions, and certainly, when you look back at the last four quarters, which all kind of filter into the maintenance growth. The last four quarters have well exceeded the flips or conversions that we saw in the prior year and just as the new business is shifting towards more SaaS, there’s an increasing interest in on-prem customers flipping. So that does have a negative effect on maintenance, but generally they’re -- the revenues that are going into the subscription side as they flip is about 2x what the maintenance was. So that’s a component on the other side of the high growth in subscriptions. And then you look at the mix of new business over the last year, as it continues to shift towards more SaaS and less license that has an effect on the growth as well. And then the last thing is some attrition around our legacy product at -- in the federal business, where the federal government has mandated some states to move off of our product and onto a federal provided product that’s had a bit of an impact there as well. So but the flips, I’d say, are the biggest impact those ongoing conversions and that’ll continue to be the case and at some point, over the next couple of years have likely be a significant acceleration in those as we have the ability to accelerate that through moving those customers in AWS.
Lynn Moore: Yeah. I think, Alex, to -- I guess to summarize, if you look out over the next couple years, you’ll see that subscription revenue line continuing to grow at an increasing pace. Conversely, you’ll see licenses contract proportionately and maintenance will probably continue to flatten out, as Brian mentioned is, as those annual increases started getting offset by flips, which our flips are up significantly year-over-year from last quarter.
Alex Zukin: Perfect. And I guess, maybe on the NIC side, so as you talked a little bit about the increasing -- increase in synergy opportunities that that you’re starting to see in the base. When should we think about, like, when we think about the -- that 5% growth that for that core NIC business that you talked about? Is that something, like, how should we think about that trending or it is an acceleration that that is going to be you guys think is sustainable from that level from here kind of ex the one-time revenues from COVID? And on the COVID impact, is there any reason why we do think that they end in the first half next year or are there any of those that actually have the potential to be more durable, given the variability of mandates?
Lynn Moore: Yeah. I’ll start with the last one. I guess, I would say, on a personal note, I think, I’ve said before, I would -- I wouldn’t be -- I’d be happy if it ended. That means that COVID is getting further in our rearview mirror. It’s our expectation. The revenues right now are primarily out of three areas, it’s out of the State of South Carolina, where they’re the primary -- doing the primary testing, also the State of Nevada and then we’ve mentioned the Virginia Unemployment Relief stuff. If the expectation is, I mean, it is a little bit of a guess, but it’s an educated guess and we’re assuming that that will wind down. What’s interesting about the South Carolina revenues as that will move from a contractor role to a subcontractor role, so while those revenues will still continue and eventually taper off, I think, our margins on those will increase. I think what’s important about the COVID initiative, though, is it really shows the ability of NIC’s team to innovate, it shows their agility and it also shows the relationships that they have with their state enterprise contracts that they could spin these things up quickly and create new solutions and I think that’s what’s exciting. When you talk about, I think, your first question was about growth rates going forward. We’re excited. I can’t tell you how excited the sales teams are, as they meet, they get together. I think as we move forward, we talk about selling all our different products through the NIC’s sales channels, and conversely, what we can bring to NIC, but you think about with Tyler Payments and we’re already seeing a lot of our Socrata Data & Insights and Entellitrak platform, Public Safety and Civic and Munis, all those deals are in the pipeline and I don’t know that going forward, we’ll always be able to sort of segregate, oh, these were NIC deals, because these are Tyler products going through them. We probably at some point won’t continue to isolate the NIC revenue growth, but what we see overall with Tyler is as part of this acquisition and part of the underlying rationale is that we believe that will help drive Tyler’s overall revenue growth at a higher level than it would have on its own.
Alex Zukin: That’s super helpful. And then the last question I wanted to ask about the IRS contract. Is there a way to dimensionalize at least what the expectation may have been for that revenue stream in 2022 before the cancellation of the agreement and any thought for us in terms of how we should think about modeling that for next year?
Lynn Moore: I’ll start but I don’t see if you have the number, but the revenues in 2022 -- the expected revenues in 2022, we have a number, Brian will get it. But a little bit was uncertain, because how fast we could get up and running and with the payment starting early in the year, the real revenue, I think, expansion was going to happen in the later years of the contract. There were some significant revenues expected. And to be honest, it’s my expectation that this procurement will come back out in the sometime this year. We’ll bid it again and for the reasons we won the first time, we should be extremely competitive going forward. Brian, you have…
Brian Miller: Yeah. We have talked about that last quarter, when we had gotten the award and I believe that number was, there were multiple providers and I believe the number was $40 million to $60 million in gross revenues and something more, I think, in the $5 million to $6 million range on a net basis after all the interchange fees. But we currently expect that, while we’re virtually certain that there won’t be any revenues in 2022, that while the IRS works through this procurement process that the existing vendors will be held in for another year. So now those weren’t in a -- none of those revenues have started already. So there was nothing in our current base that goes away. But it’s pretty clear that won’t be a 2022 impact at this point and we’ll see how fast the new procurement takes place.
Alex Zukin: Got it. Thank you, guys. Congrats.
Operator: The next question comes from Charlie Strauzer from CJS Securities. Please go ahead.
Charlie Strauzer: Hi. Good morning. A quick question for you, I know you don’t like to give out formal 2022 guidance until the next call, but maybe some early thoughts on, so what you’re thinking about for next year?
Lynn Moore: Well, you’re right, Charlie, we don’t like to get out ahead of ourselves. We -- right now we are well into our 2022 planning. There’s a lot of variations, lot of factors that go into that. We’re still in the early stages. I’d say, we’re kind of on track with our normal planning process. I’d really expect to have better information later this year. I think it’s just a little too early right now to go ahead and forecast 2022.
Charlie Strauzer: That’s fair. No problem. And then just looking at the labor side, a lot of companies having labor issues, trying to find new qualified people, I’m sure you’re not immune to that as well. Maybe you can talk a little bit about the labor side, any difficulties you have in there, the cause in wage inflation, et cetera? Thanks.
Lynn Moore: Yeah. Charlie, I think, that’s a good point. It’s -- we’re all reading in the news, what’s going on across multiple industries. The labor market is certainly evolving right now. There’s staffing pressures. There’s wage pressures. And I’d say, Tyler hasn’t been immune to that. I think there’s still a little to figure out about how permanent this is versus how transitory it is. You’re seeing people leaving careers for lifestyle changes. We call it sort of COVID casualties. You’re seeing competition for wages and more people are now being more accepted to flexible work and work work-from-home that you’re seeing people come in and go into markets that they may not have traditionally tried to hire people from and we’re dealing with that as well. I think if you look across a lot of our business units, we’re staffed a little bit under plan. Our HR team and our recruiters are doing a really good job responding to this. Working really hard, but it is something that’s it’s top of mind. It’s something that we discussed at the executive level, and you’re right, Tyler has not been immune to it.
Charlie Strauzer: And just speak up on a little bit more when you look at your current employment base, are you still asking people to kind of move back on site and into the offices this fall?
Lynn Moore: Yeah. So we’re on track to sort of -- we’ve taken a phase-based approach and we’ve taken a locally-based phase-based approach is, as the jurist -- each jurisdiction is a little bit different the way they’ve handled it. And so essentially we’re on track right now to sort of come back to what we would call full back in the office at the first of the year. What that means is probably not exactly what it meant before COVID. There will be a little bit more flexibility. That’s part of the market today and so I’d expect some of that going before.
Charlie Strauzer: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Rob Oliver from Baird. Please go ahead.
Rob Oliver: Great. Thank you, guys. Good morning. My question, first question is, Lynn, on Public Safety, just wanted to dive into that a little bit, it sounds like you guys are excited about Arx deal in terms of the full suite of products that it gives you guys for police. So I wanted to ask about that and whether we would expect that to be available in the bag of solutions for your Public Safety sales folks that are closing deals in the all important Q4 here? And then just a broader question about what you guys are seeing and hearing from customers and Public Safety. I mean, it’s really been a secured its type of a year where we went from defined and now it seems like more in fund environment? And just curious what that means for you guys relative to the pipeline in your confidence levels on public safety into Q4? And then I had a quick follow-up.
Lynn Moore: Yeah. Thanks, Rob. That’s a good question. Arx is a -- yeah, we are excited about Arx, it is relatively small acquisition. Even Arx really it’s a database solution that that really helps the Chief of Police, helps the command staff, helps supervisors, really had more insight in the activity of the law enforcement that are on the job, helps with compliance issues, helps promote officer wellness by doing things like identifying stress, risk mitigation. And you’re right, there has been sort of talk around Public Safety area and a lot of different areas, and a lot of focus lately and has been on law enforcement reform and this was something that was missing in our product suite. Arx is a company that’s based in Detroit, which is close to our Public Safety office in Detroit. They had been a partner of Public Safety in a number of deals. This solution had been sought out more and more, and you’re right, it really rounds out our portfolio of Public Safety Solutions. I’d expect it to be something like we do a lot of acquisitions that it’s something we’re going to sell in our Insight channels and it’s also going to become a differentiator in new deals. You’re seeing more and more Public Safety entities looking for these types of solutions for the reasons you just talked about. When you talk about the funding for Public Safety, I mentioned earlier that are, different parts of our business were impacted differently and Public Safety is not suggesting it wasn’t impacted, but it’s still going pretty good. The number of license deals that has got this year, they’re expected licenses are up over 35% year-over-year. We’ve talked a lot before about the investments we’ve made there and then the number of deals that will be $1 million plus in license will be more than we’ve ever had before. I think the funding is there, the initiatives are there and I -- we’ve been making a lot of investments and we’ve done some acquisitions to have round mobility and things like that, that make us even more competitive. So I’m pretty still -- I’m still very excited about where we stand with Public Safety and where the future is for that.
Rob Oliver: Great. I appreciate that’s great color. Thanks, Lynn. And then just one follow-up, I know, Matt, asked that first question about, the stimulus funds and you touched on that. But I just did want to follow up, just briefly, because you guys said in both the press release and in your comments here that, you’re starting to see some deals that are specifically related to that funding and you mentioned, I think, the pipeline of I think it doesn’t spurred by fed -- federal stim. Just curious, what you’re hearing from customers. You mentioned a pretty wide swath of Tyler products and is -- can we assume that the bulk of Tyler’s products would qualify and our available under that and then, if not, you -- I think you mentioned kind of potential tailwind over many years. So are there two ways to think about this, is it one way to think about it. Yes, federal stimulus dollars are going to be flowing to Tyler clear positive. Another would be that budgets being shored up also creates opportunities for more confidence in spending or is that kind of the right way to think about a couple of different buckets? Appreciate it.
Lynn Moore: Yeah. I’d say and to clarify my comments earlier, if you look at the deals in Q3 and Q4. I’d say, there is probably a few dozen deals where they’re being impacted. I’m not suggesting that they’re being fully funded, but they are -- there may be partial funding or part of the equation. I think your comment is around confidence is something that I’ve touched on before and I believe that the confidence of having that blanket behind them along with generally what’s been going on in the market is helpful for all the deals. We are seeing federal stimulus, when I talk about these few dozen deals, they are across different products of Tyler. I don’t know that I would necessarily single out more than others. Although, there are some stimulus dollars that are specifically tied to schools. So, I think, generally it’s a positive. It’s something that’s still a lot of our clients and prospective clients are -- there is still a lot of them still trying to figure out, how do we access them, which dollars are actually there and it’s something that our marketing team in conjunction with our sales teams are putting together materials to help educate our clients and help navigate them where we can. But, yeah, it’s a tailwind. Generally speaking, it’s hard to quantify at this point. But, overall, I think, it’s part of our -- it’s part of the reason for optimism we have at Tyler.
Brian Miller: And the American Rescue Plan, there is not much restrictions on what they can use it for us. So, I’d say, generally almost anything Tyler has in our portfolio is would be available to be purchased or acquired through the ARP funds and they have until the end of 2024 to spend those funds. And the indications we have is that it’s a very small percentage of those funds that have so far been spent or even allocated, there is still a lot of work going on in governments around determining how they’re going to spend those. But there it’s -- there’s a lot of flexibility around what they can spend those on.
Rob Oliver: Yeah. I think they’re trying to route one or two school buses for our whole district. So I ask those guys to give you guys a call. So, hopefully, you’ve got that from here in Connecticut. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.
Operator: The next question comes from Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Kirk Materne: Yeah. Thanks very much and congrats on a good quarter. Lynn, I was wondering if you could talk or Brian if you could talk about just sort of the bookings level for NIC on an organic basis and I know obviously the core Tyler bookings were up a lot. But NIC’s growth of that 5% or is the book ahead of that rate right now. I realize there some rev rec things that make it a little tricky, but are you pleased with sort of the bookings trends in NIC right now?
Brian Miller: Because they’re mostly transaction base their bookings and revenue…
Kirk Materne: Aligned.
Brian Miller: …are pretty aligned, yes. They have some software business and I had a couple nice deals this quarter, we mentioned our biggest software dealer across Tyler came through NIC. But, generally, the vast majority of their revenues are coming through transactions, they are pretty much aligned. They’re pretty reliable. I guess that there is a little bit of seasonality. So we saw higher growth last quarter, a little bit lower growth this quarter. One of the areas that had been impacted in their business more by COVID is the driver history records, which is a significant part of their business and the growth there is a little slow right now. But expect those to rebound as things get back to normal, but offsetting that is that transaction volumes are generally up given the people are doing more business digitally with state governments. So, but generally, those bookings and revenues would be pretty similar.
Kirk Materne: Okay. That’s helpful. Thanks, Brian. And then, Lynn, as you look ahead 2022, you obviously have a much broader product portfolio at this point in time? What sort of your temperature on in terms of sort of focusing on what you have already harmonizing technology, go-to-market versus doing any other deals. I know you did a couple of smaller tuck-ins this quarter, but you have a huge product portfolio. I assume the focus is going to be on more just sort of again harmonizing the technology of what you have and go-to-market. Is that sort of the way we should be thinking about the strategy in the next year?
Lynn Moore: So I think you’re right, we do have a lot of initiatives going on. We do have a lot of with larger portfolio than we did even three year, four years, five years ago. We are focused on. We did just spend over $2 billion on NIC. We’re clearly focused on that. We’re also clearly focused on our cloud initiatives and things that we need to do to continue to optimize our products and do some things with our internal operations as we move there. I’ve talked before about how we approach M&A generally and we’ve done a little bit this year. And I think earlier when we’re talking about NIC, I said, we may go back to a couple of years ago, where we have a little bit of deliberate pause, we did a couple of other deals this year VendEngine, DataSpec. These were deals that were sort of in the works. I think though as we go into next year, we’re going to remain opportunistic. We’re going to continue to look at deals. I continue to look at deals today. I have been looking at deals over the last couple of months. Even though while we still have all this activity going on and when the right deal is out there. If it fits a need, whether it’s small, medium or large, we will definitely still in the position to execute on that and then I would expect that we would.
Kirk Materne: Okay. That’s helpful. All right. I’ll leave it there. Thanks guys.
Operator: The next question comes from Keith Housum from Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.
Keith Housum: Good morning, guys. And I’ll echo the quarter was great for you guys. Congratulations. Recall that the NIC business and just revisiting the prior question, it seems like the driver history record for NIC is not been up to par since really COVID began. Is there anything structurally that perhaps has changed at the driver history records perhaps might not go back to the previous gross -- growth trajectory they had?
Lynn Moore: I didn’t quite hear the question.
Brian Miller: Oh! I don’t -- we’re not aware of anything structurally, fundamentally that’s changed around that. We expect that those will rebound back to normal levels. Certainly, there is no change in the way insurance companies are getting their information, but -- and there hasn’t been a change in our pricing, at least no negative change and I know in some of our renewals we’ve been able to get increases in pricing. So don’t think there’s any fundamental change around the DHR side.
Keith Housum: Got you. Okay. Appreciate it. And the length of your contracts, obviously, I was 3.4 years and average this quarter was very good. I remember back to previous conversations, the idea was short of time spend opportunity have raised -- to raise prices on the contract renewals. Can you talk about the success you guys are having in terms of pricing changes as contracts are coming up for renewal?
Lynn Moore: Yeah. I think in the last -- there hasn’t really been a change through COVID. We’ve been generally in maintenance agreements. We’ve targeted kind of in the 4% to 5% annual increases in on subscription renewals, targets are generally in that same range. And as you said the shortening the initial terms because those revenues are straight lined over the term of the agreement, gives us the opportunity to realize the benefit of those increases sooner. And generally we’re leading with shorter terms and this quarter had success with that. Occasionally, particularly on some of the large contracts like I think back to the North Carolina courts injustice we have a 10-year agreement. So that can bounce around a bit. But we do prefer to have shorter agreements and the pricing has been in line with what we’ve historically tried to achieve.
Keith Housum: Great. Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Jonathan Ho from William Blair & Company. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Ho: Hi. Good morning. Congrats on the strong results. I just wanted to maybe start out with some additional color on the VendEngine and Arx acquisitions that you guys recently made and just potentially understanding what the opportunity is to up-sell these types of opportunities there.
Brian Miller: Yeah. Sure, Jonathan. VendEngine, we’re pretty excited about that acquisition. It was a little bit larger. We’re excited about both. But I didn’t mean to imply. We’re excited about Arx. I think I just talked about Arx a little bit. But for VendEngine corrections -- and the corrections market for us with something that we’ve really seen as a significant growth opportunity. We’ve been investing in some in our core corrections product for some time. It’s a key part of our Tyler alliance, which our Connected Communities Vision and it’s really sort of -- the corrections area is sort of the crossover points between courts and Public Safety and is probably the largest market and this is white space that we didn’t really have a leading product. And inmate services is becoming increasingly important to that opportunity. There is more and more requirements in RFPs around there. We partnered with VendEngine over years in a number of deals and they’re really just a leader there. I expect that the revenue this year will be somewhere in the $20 million all IRR and it’s been growing at 30% plus for the last few years. I do think we have enough opportunity to sell that into our existing client base, but also it will help us lead with our corrections and standalone deals. So we’re pretty excited about that deal. Similarly with Arx, I talked a little bit about -- before about the focus on law enforcement reform and that was a bit of a hole in our portfolio, again almost similar playbook, we had worked with them some, really like them, really like the product, good cultural fit and we really think it will round out our portfolio, and as you mentioned, selling back into our base. I mean our existing customer base is something I say all the time, it’s our greatest asset and the more solutions we have, the more that we can push through there and drive growth.
Jonathan Ho: Got it. And on that multiproduct sale point, can you -- maybe give us a sense of how to better understand how some of these incremental products have been uplifting your deals. I think the examples that you cited, you did mentioned a number of multiproduct opportunities. What should we think about in terms of maybe net expansion rates or the ability to cross-sell more into the base over time, as well as multiproduct on new sales? Thank you.
Brian Miller: Yeah. You are -- we’re seeing it across all of our solutions and we talk about some of these smaller core tuck-in deals. Those are deals that actually are really are being sold quite a bit now across our product lines. You look at Public Safety for example. We’ve talked about deals where we sell either our core cat or core records. But it also includes things like Socrata and you probably heard us mentioned Data -- Data & Insight is becoming a differentiator for us across many product lines. But we also talk about Mobility and Brazos, SoftCode and Mobilized. These are all products that were done through acquisitions in the last three years, four years, five years or so. You see it on the enterprise side, things like ExecuTime, time and attendance management. We’ve seen it in the court space and it is part of our overall strategy and it makes us that much more competitive as we have a wider range of solutions and sort of an enterprise suite as we compete against people who don’t have such a diverse set of solutions to fit the client needs.
Jonathan Ho: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Peter Heckmann from D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.
Peter Heckmann: Hey. Thanks for taking my call. I appreciate it. I’m trying to figure out on just appraisal and also a big part of the business, but it seems like there have been some notable wins there. Do we expect a real step function change in the size of that appraisal business or other older contracts rolling off and you’re appraisal should kind of continue to be a pretty consistent contributor?
Lynn Moore: I’d say broadly it’s pretty consistent. We have deals. These projects often our multiyear projects sometimes two years or three years, sometimes longer. Some of them are driven by legislated cycles in certain state like Indiana and Ohio that have regular cycles, where we have the almost like recurring appraisal projects. Others are more one-off. These three counties in Delaware that comprise all of Delaware that we’re getting ready to start. It was a court-ordered reappraisal, so sometimes the courts get involved when it’s determined that appraisals are out of date and maybe contributing to unfair distribution of taxes. So that’s the case with these. And we are pretty uniquely positioned to be able to have a strong competitive position in those large deals and there’s one-off kinds of deals, they can be a little bit lumpy, and but I’d say, we’re generally in a -- at a range we’re probably on a more active period right now, particularly coming out of COVID where some of these projects may have been delayed, but I wouldn’t say it would be a step function, where there is a big step up. But we’re doing really well in that business right now.
Peter Heckmann: Okay. That’s fair. And then just and thinking about the NIC business and you gave out some renewals of state contracts that appear to be far ahead of their actual expiration date and so as you go through and start talking to these states, are you trying to get them to renew early and opt up for additional years. And just as regard that, we certainly with the change in Texas and Deloitte kind of getting back into the market. How are you thinking about some of their more mid-sized state renewals here over the next 18 months? Do you expect any change in the competitive dynamics or is kind of your base case that a renewal with the ability to up-sell some additional Tyler applications?
Lynn Moore: Yeah. I think is -- I would say, my outlook is pretty optimistic. I will talk about Texas first, our payments business or their -- NIC payments business in Texas is one of our strong outperformance this quarter. When you talk about -- we mentioned Utah and we mentioned Oklahoma, these were early renewals. And part of that actually the reason for the early renewal was some of the excitement that’s been generated through NIC with the customer about what the combined entity of Tyler and NIC can bring. We’ve talked about our Connected Communities Vision. We’ve talk about the different products and offerings that we can bring and I think both of these states were areas where they’re seeing that future and they wanted to get -- they wanted to go ahead and jump in early, which gives me optimism for what I think we’ll see going forward in the market.
Peter Heckmann: Okay. That’s good to hear. That’s all I have for now. Thanks.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Lynn Moore for any closing remarks.
Lynn Moore: Great. Thanks, Jason, and thanks everybody for joining us today. We hope you stay safe and healthy and if you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Brian Miller or myself. Have a good day everybody.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-29 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to today's Tyler Technologies Second Quarter 2021 Conference Call. Your host for today's call is Lynn Moore, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, July 29, 2021.  I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Moore. Please go ahead.
Lynn Moore: Thank you, Andrew, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. With me today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like for Brian to give the Safe Harbor statement. Next, I'll have some preliminary comments on our quarter results, and then Brian will review the details. I'll end with some additional comments, and then we'll take questions. Brian?
Brian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. During the course of this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information and may include projections concerning the company's future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless we specify otherwise. Lynn?
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. First, I want to provide you with an update on the NIC acquisition and our progress in the first 3 months post closing, and then we'll move on to a review of the quarter's results. As you know, we completed the acquisition of NIC during the second quarter on April 21st. With a purchase price of approximately $2.3 billion, this was by far our largest acquisition to date and our first acquisition of a public company. NIC is a leading provider of digital government solutions and payment processing that serves more than 7,100 federal, state and local government agencies across the nation. We believe that the combination of NIC and Tyler provides tremendous opportunities for incremental growth in both businesses. The combined company is the public sector market leader for payment solutions and we plan to use NIC's robust payment platform to expand our local government payments business. We also have an opportunity to leverage NIC's strong relationships and state enterprise contracts to deliver Tyler solutions at the state level, including our MicroPact and Entellitrak platform. We discussed our vision for those opportunities on our Investor Call in early June. I'm extremely pleased with the progress we've made toward these objectives in the 3 months that NIC has been a part of Tyler. Our teams have prioritized our opportunities and are very engaged, working well together in a regular cadence. Our pre-acquisition impressions regarding the high degree of compatibility between the cultures of the 2 organizations have thus far proven to be accurate and leaders in both organizations have commented on how natural the combination feels. Our payments teams are working together and have been very encouraged as we learn more about each company's strengths and how complementary they are. As we noted on our June call, the state of Florida is a great example of the kind of opportunities we're pursuing. NIC is in the process of implementing a statewide payment processing solution for the state government in Florida. And the contract allows for local governments in the state, more than 400 of which are Tyler clients, to piggyback on that contract and we are actively pursuing those opportunities. For the last 2 months, we've also been conducting weekly showcases to familiarize NIC state enterprise managers with Tyler's broad portfolio of solutions and to surface opportunities in their states. We have already developed a growing joint pipeline that is generating active engagements with prospects in NIC states. And finally, our teams are actively working together to jointly establish the data and analytics platform for Connected Communities, leveraging our respective strengths, including our Socrata Data & Insights platform and NIC's Gov2Go Citizen portal. Together, NIC and Tyler can now provide the most expansive set of capabilities for citizens to interact with government at all levels. Turning to the quarter. NIC, like Tyler, had a very strong second quarter as they continue to benefit from the recovery from the pandemic with a growing demand for citizens and businesses to interact digitally with government. NIC also recorded higher than expected revenues from its tour health and pandemic unemployment initiatives, although those lower-margin revenues are currently expected to taper off in the second half of the year. Although NIC's results are only included in Tyler's consolidated financials from the date of the acquisition on April 21, for the full quarter, NIC's core revenues, excluding revenues from Tour Health and Pandemic Unemployment Initiatives, grew 23.5%. We're also very pleased to report that in late June, NIC was selected as 1 of 2 vendors to provide the Internal Revenue Service with a digital payment processing solution, which will allow individual and business taxpayers to securely pay their federal taxes. The contract has an initial 6-month term with 4 1-year renewal options and revenue under the contract is expected to begin in January of 2022. The actual revenue will be driven by the number of taxpayers who choose to pay online and who choose to use the NIC platform, and we expect to aggressively market our solution. We currently estimate annual gross revenue under the contract to be between $40 million and $60 million with annual net revenue of $5 million to $7 million after interchange and merchant fees. This contract significantly expands NIC's payment processing at the federal level and underscores the strength of NIC's platform and leadership in public sector payments. Moving on to our consolidated results. Our second quarter was very strong, reflecting the inclusion of the results of NIC from April 21 with both core Tyler and NIC operations exceeding expectations. Total revenues grew 49.1% driven by the inclusion of NIC, as well as the acceleration of Tyler's organic growth to 12.4%. Recurring revenues comprised 79% of our second quarter revenues and were led by 133% growth in subscription revenues with the inclusion of NIC. Excluding NIC revenues, subscription revenue growth was robust at 24%. Software licenses and services revenues also rebounded from the low point in last year's second quarter, growing 17% or 7.6%, excluding NIC. As expected, our margins were down compared to second quarter last year as some costs and lower margin revenues, like billable travel, that declined in 2020 due to COVID pandemic began to return. Margins were also impacted by the inclusion of NIC and particularly by the continuation of their lower-margin COVID-related revenues. As a result, our non-GAAP operating margin declined 100 basis points to 26.5%. Bookings in the second quarter grew 50% to approximately $464 million with the inclusion of NIC. Excluding NIC, bookings rose 17.5%. Our largest deal in the quarter was a combination license and SaaS arrangement with the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies valued at approximately $9.3 million for our Entellitrak regulatory, Socrata Data & Insights, and SceneDoc Mobile Field Inspection Solutions, as well as NIC's electronic payment solution. And all those solutions will be hosted in AWS. This deal is a great example of our ability to add value by offering multiple Tyler products, many of which came from recent acquisitions, into a single deal, enhancing the competitiveness of solutions like Entellitrak. We also signed a large public safety license contract with the Lake County Sheriffs office in Illinois for our CAD, RMS, Mobile, Field Reporting, Brazos e-citation, Soft Code Process Service and Socrata Data & Insight solutions valued at approximately $4.1 million. In addition, we signed 4 other license deals across multiple product suites, each with contract values greater than $1 million. SaaS contracts represented 65% of our new contract software value in the second quarter. Our largest SaaS contract was a 5-year deal with Dubuque, Iowa, for our Munis ERP and EnerGov Civic Services Solutions valued at approximately $4.6 million. We also signed SaaS contracts for our Munis ERP solution with Charles County, Maryland, valued at approximately $4 million; and DeSoto, Texas valued at approximately $3.5 million. We also signed a SaaS deal for our Tyler Supervision Solution with Riverside County, California, valued at approximately $3.3 million. This is the largest deal to date for our Supervision product, which came to Tyler through the acquisition of CaseloadPRO, a little less than 3 years ago. And in fact, the value of the single contract is greater than the total annual revenues of that business when we acquired it. In addition, we signed 9 other SaaS arrangements during the quarter, each with a total contract value of greater than $1 million. In addition to the IRS payment processing contract, during the second quarter, NIC signed extensions of its state enterprise contracts for digital government and payment processing services with the states of Oregon and Idaho. NIC also signed a 5-year SaaS agreement for its RXGov prescription drug monitoring program solution with the province of New Brunswick, Canada, marking the first international deployment for that solution. We're pleased to see the increased market activity and trends that reflect our markets are rebounding back toward pre-COVID levels. Now, I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter.
Brian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2021. Note that the results of DataSpec and ReadySub, which were acquired on March 31st, are included in our consolidated results for the full quarter and the results of NIC are included in our results from the date of acquisition, April 21st. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results in comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financial Reports tab schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. GAAP revenues for the quarter were $404.1 million, up 49.1%. Non-GAAP revenues were $405.4 million, up 49.4%. On an organic basis, GAAP and non-GAAP revenues grew 12.4% and 12.3%, respectively. Software license revenues rose 3.4%. Subscription revenues rose 133%. Excluding the contribution from NIC, subscription revenues were still very strong, growing 24%. We added 170 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 62 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $73 million in total contract value. In Q2 of last year, we added 125 new subscription-based arrangements and had 42 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $39 million in total contract value. Subscription contract value comprised approximately 65% of total new software contract value signed this quarter, compared to 43% in Q2 of last year, as we continued our shift to a cloud first approach to sales. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter were 4.1 years, compared to 3.7 last year.  Transaction based revenues, which include NIC portal revenues, payment processing and e-filing are included in subscriptions -- and are included in subscriptions, were $119.6 million, up 463%. That amount includes e-filing revenues of $16.3 million, up 14.5%. Excluding NIC, Tyler's transaction-based revenues grew 24.1%.  For the second quarter, our annualized non-GAAP total recurring revenue, or ARR, was approximately $1.3 billion, up 58.2%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS software arrangements for Q2 was approximately $325 million, up 25.9%. Transaction-based ARR was approximately $479 million, up 463% and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was approximately $478 million, up 2.4%. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $1.63 billion, up 5.6%. Because the vast majority of NIC's revenues are transaction based, their backlog at quarter end was only $21 million. As Lynn noted, our bookings in the quarter were very robust at $464 million, up 50.1% and includes the transaction-based revenues of NIC. On an organic basis, bookings were strong at approximately $364 million, up 17.5%. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1.3 billion, up 9.6%. And on an organic basis, were approximately $1.2 billion, up 1.3%. Our software subscription bookings in the second quarter added $15 million in new annual recurring revenue. Cash from operations and free cash flow were both negative in the second quarter as Q2 included approximately $19 million of acquisition-related costs. In addition, cash from operations and free cash flow were negatively impacted by the timing of cash collections by NIC on behalf of government agencies prior to the close of the acquisition and remittances to the agency's post acquisition. This is purely a timing difference and will normalize in future quarters. Our balance sheet remains very strong. During the quarter, we paid down $185 million of the debt incurred under our revolver in connection with the acquisition. We ended the quarter with total outstanding debt of $1.565 billion and cash and investments of $380.9 million. Since the end of the quarter, we have repaid an additional $52 million on the revolver. And today, we have outstanding $1.513 billion of debt with a blended stated interest rate of 1.01%. We have raised our revenue and EPS guidance for the full year of 2021, which is as follows. We expect 2021 GAAP total revenues will be between $1.532 billion and $1.557 billion and non-GAAP total revenues will be between $1.535 billion and $1.560 billion. We expect total revenues will include approximately $32 million of COVID-related revenues from NIC's Tour Health and Pandemic Unemployment Services that are not expected to recur in future years. We expect 2021 GAAP diluted EPS will be between $3.68 and $3.81 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $6.70 and $6.80. Interest expense for the year is expected to be approximately $23 million and includes approximately $11 million of amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs. For the year, pretax noncash share-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $102 million. We expect R&D expense for the year will be between $94 million and $96 million. Fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between 42 million and 42.5 million shares. GAAP earnings per share assumes an estimated annual effective tax rate of negative 2% after discrete tax items and includes approximately $46 million of estimated discrete tax benefits related to share-based compensation, which may vary significantly based on the timing and volume of stock option exercises. Our estimated non-GAAP annual effective tax rate for 2021 is 24%. We expect our total capital expenditures will be between $48 million and $50 million for the year, including approximately $10 million related to real estate and approximately $22 million of capitalized software development costs. Total depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $126 million, including approximately $89 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn.
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. As you can see, our team of professionals, including our new team members at NIC, DataSpec and ReadySub, executed at a very high level in the second quarter, driving results that surpassed expectations. As I've said before, I'm extremely proud of how our team members have responded to the challenges in the last 1.5 years with incredible grit, grace and resilience. And we're proud that Tyler has recently been named a Best Place to Work by publications in Washington, D.C., Colorado and Mississippi, joining several other locations where Tyler has received similar awards. We've continued to invest in, and in some cases, accelerate all of our long-term strategic initiatives, in particular, our shift to a cloud-first approach with a focus on optimizing our products for the cloud and transitioning SaaS deployments from Tyler data centers to AWS. As a result, our competitive position has also continued to strengthen. We continue to see indications that our market is returning to normal, as many delayed procurement processes are moving forward and new processes are starting. RFPs and sales activities such as demos are trending toward, and in some cases, exceeding pre-COVID levels. While not a significant factor in Q2, we expect that the $350 billion of aid to state and local governments and $167 billion of aid schools under the American Rescue Plan Act will provide a significant measure of relief to budget pressures faced by many of our clients and prospects and potentially provide a tailwind over the next 2 to 3 years.  With that, we'd like to open the line for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Peter Heckmann with D.A. Davidson.
PeterHeckmann: Great to see a very strong quarter for both Tyler and EGOV right out of the box. Congratulations on the IRS win. Just curious, the -- if I'm looking at it correctly, the annual guide, which you just gave in June, but it didn't go up as much as the relative beat in the quarter. There's some elements in the quarter that were maybe more onetime in nature or was it affected just by the timing of the close of NIC versus your original expectations? Or do you think that there's something that we should be thinking about for the back half in terms of margins?
LynnMoore: Well, the -- I'd say one of the factors certainly is that we've increased the expectation around the amount of revenues, certainly both in this quarter and continuing on into the third quarter around the COVID-related services that NIC is providing. Those have gone on a little bit longer. We expect they'd wrap up really in the second quarter and those are continuing on into the second half of the year. So that's part of the factor around the second quarter outperforming on the revenue side, but not expecting to see that same bump in the second half of the year. Otherwise, we took up the guidance a bit. But typically, by the -- in the second quarter, we're not looking to raise numbers quite a bit until we have better visibility around the second half.
PeterHeckmann: Okay. Okay. And then just -- again, congrats on the IRS contract. That's a pretty good-sized deal and -- but do you believe it will be -- will you be recording it gross or net?
LynnMoore: That's expected to be growth accounting. We're the merchant of record there, and we'll be responsible for the merchant and interchange fees. So it's a higher revenue number, but lower margin.
PeterHeckmann: Lower margin. So on a gross basis, maybe margins come through at high single digits or so?
LynnMoore: Yes. I mean if we're we're looking at -- we said sort of between $40 million and $60 million in revenues and the net revenue number kind of in the $5 million to $7 million range.
BrianMiller: Yes, Pete, of their larger contracts, IRS and Texas are -- will be on a gross basis. Florida will be on a net basis when those revenues kick up starting late this year and really going into next year.
Operator: The next question comes from Matt VanVliet with BTIG.
MattVanVliet: Congrats on the quarter. Lynn, I guess, in part of your closing you mentioned that significant amount of stimulus funds sort of still available to local governments in particular. But curious in terms of what you're hearing. A lot of that recently reported as being unspent and people looking at what kind of time duration that might actually entail. Curious how much of that is sort of inspiring some of this uptick in RFPs and sales activity? And then conversely, has any of the delays in the proposed infrastructure bill put a little bit of a pause in some of these as those governments look to see kind of what else might be coming before they spend some of these funds now?
BrianMiller: Yes, Matt. I think I probably read the same general editorial yesterday about the -- some of the unspent funds from the American Rescue Plan. I don't know that -- I think what it's done is it's provided confidence. We've talked before, the reality is that the impact of budgets was a lot less severe than before. Those funds are still sitting there. Some of those funds do have some timing elements with respect to when they need to be spent. And some of that is still TBD. I think when you're seeing the more releases in RFPs, the things that we're seeing in the market, the more demos, the activity picking up. I mean, in some parts of our business really to pre-COVID levels, some just almost getting back to pre-COVID levels. I think a function of that, too, is just the general sentiment and mood out there. I think the American Rescue Plan provides that confidence. We're also, as you know, most of our clients are now in a new budget year. And I think with those expectations for more funding, they saw the real impact to their budgets from last year were not as severe. And I think just -- I think some of that's coming back. And I think you've just also highlight what we've talked about throughout the last 1.5 years is that the demand for what we do doesn't go away. It's going to be pent-up. And so we're starting to see that. So at a high level, that's what I'd say. And on the delays on the infrastructure bill, I don't know that that's really going to have much of an impact on what we see in terms of bids and RFPs in our day-to-day business.
LynnMoore: I'd add, the American Rescue Plan, they've got until the end of 2024 to spend that. In fact, they just are getting the first half this year and the second half a year from now of those funds. So there's still a lot of allocations and determinations within these governments around how they're going to spend that money. So as we said in the prepared remarks, we really haven't seen much of an impact in terms of new deals and things that are of a significant size that are specifically tied to those funds. Most of the activity we're seeing today is more around the recovery of the -- or the resumption of some of those delayed processes and things that would have taken place in the last year otherwise.
MattVanVliet: All right. Very helpful. And then following up on a number of deals that you announced with, I guess, both legacy Tyler and NIC products. So congrats on that. But just curious in terms of sort of an update of where you're at in terms of the full integration of the sales teams, the go-to-market mechanism. Are you just starting to get to some of that, and we can see more of these deals coming through? Or do you think there's already been a lot of progress, and it's just more of getting through sales cycles from here forward?
LynnMoore: Are you talking specifically with the NIC integration?
MattVanVliet: Yes, the integration of the go-to-market for NIC into legacy Tyler.
LynnMoore: Yes. So the integration is going well. We talked about it on our -- I think it was our June update call. We've got a lot of excitement. We have -- our priorities, though, we really want to make sure that they -- we don't do anything to mess up the business. We make their plan, retain their staff, identify these initiatives, get the sales teams aligned and we're doing that. Obviously, Harry Herington, their founder, he decided to retire. One of the key things that we first had to do was establish new leadership. We've done that. Elizabeth Proudfit's now leading that division. She's been with NIC for over 20 years and been responsible for selling most of their major state enterprise contracts, including Florida. As I mentioned in my comments, we've hit the ground running. Our Tyler teams are showcasing products really 2 to 3 a week with all of their state GMs. Our payments teams have gotten together and working on Tyler technology integration plans, talking about how we can leverage NIC relationships. I guess I'd say all that stuff is -- it's active. It's going on. The excitement continues to be there. I'll echo my comments from back in June, balancing expectations. If you've been around a long time, these things take time. But the excitement is there. And we are seeing and identifying joint opportunities. It takes a while for those to come to fruition. But like I said, every time our teams meet, the excitement only continues to grow.
Operator: The next question comes from Scott Berg with Needham & Company.
ScottBerg: Lynn and Brian, congrats on a good quarter. I guess 2 probably simple ones. The first question is on just general deal flow from the core Tyler side when you talked about how things seem to be normalizing more towards prepandemic levels, the volume of deal flow certainly speaks to that in the quarter. I guess my question there, is that more just pent-up demand that's flowing out? Or are you seeing a true normalization maybe of those sales cycles in the last quarter or two? And then my second question, Brian, is on your guidance for the year. The non I guess, ongoing revenues from the Tour Health and the Pandemic side from NIC was increased from $21 million to $32 million for the year. Did that mean the overall NIC contribution for the year went up that much? Or is it just maybe a shift in revenues within your expected contribution from that business?
LynnMoore: Thanks, Scott. I'll start. And I'd say it's a little bit of both. Q2 last year was a slow year. And we talked about it in the last couple of earnings calls, about how the impact was really felt a little bit differently across different parts of our business. But what we're starting to see now is that the number of RFPs are up significantly from Q2 a year ago, up over 50%. Trade shows are returning. Our unsigned selections, which we don't talk about a lot. Those are up significantly. The number of new deals, as you pointed out, that we signed this quarter was, I think, up over 30% from a year ago. When you look at areas like where I talked about the last few quarters, where we saw a little bit more slowdown was more in our high-end financials, our Munis and our EnerGov solutions. We're certainly seeing the momentum growing there. I think Q4 was probably a low in those areas for RFPs and selections. And those are up significantly. And remember, those types of deals, they generally take about 3 quarters from RFP to close. So there will continue to be a lag as we're seeing these RFPs come up, but that's continuing other places like our lower-end financials, our in code. I think RFPs now are actually back to 2019 levels. So it's there. It's a combination of pent-up demand, but also just the market returning.
BrianMiller: And on the NIC COVID-related revenues, yes, that increase in our estimate of what those revenues will be for the year and the increase in what was actually recorded in the second quarter is -- was added to NIC's revenue. So that's incremental to our estimates that we previously had for their full year revenues. Unfortunately, with some of the resurgence of COVID and the Delta variant, there's more of a need for testing for a longer period with some of our clients than we had previously expected. And some of those agreements have been extended beyond when we expected that they would roll off. We still expect that they will taper down in the third quarter and pretty minimal revenues from those in the fourth quarter.
ScottBerg: Excellent. Congrats again.
Operator: The next question comes from Charlie Strauzer with CJS Securities.
CharlieStrauzer: Lynn, if you could kind of talk a little bit more about the pipeline and length of the sales cycle, is that shrinking at all? And are you seeing a pickup at all in prospective clients from the rash of cyberattacks that have been in the news lately?
LynnMoore: First, I'm not sure I heard all that. The first question was about the pipeline. The pipeline is -- I think across all our major core apps, the pipeline is certainly returning. I don't know that it's -- I think there are parts of our business where it's back to full pre-COVID levels and in some cases exceeding, some places, it's approaching there. So all the signs right now out there, all the leading indicators that we talk about, demos and trade shows are coming back, RFPs being released, deals without RFPs. Those are all up significantly sequentially quarter and significant year-over-year. So that's significant. And the second question was about -- I didn't quite catch the second question. Could you just repeat the second one?
CharlieStrauzer: Yes, just with the rash of cyber attacks in the news, have you seen any pickup in the inquiries from your clients about maybe moving to the cloud more rapidly than they may have thought before?
LynnMoore: It's a good question. I think it's just all part of the overall equation. I think the increase that we've seen, I talked earlier about our financial solutions, Munis and Encode. I mean our new deals there are 85%, 90% SaaS. A couple of years ago, it was more like in the 50% range. I think it's just -- I think that's just a piece of the puzzle. I don't know that there's anything specific around some of those cyber security things, but security is a big part of it. But I think it's that, coupled with COVID, coupled with just the general direction the market had been moving over the last several years.
BrianMiller: This was a pretty good margin, the largest quarter we've ever had for flips or customers moving or existing customers moving from on-premises to the cloud as well. And that's one of the factors, I think. Not the sole factor, but a factor in that desire of customers to move to our cloud solution.
CharlieStrauzer: Interesting. And then Brian, if you could just -- looking at the guidance a little bit, if you can give us a little bit more clarity as to how we should think about the cadence of the next few quarters? Just kind of help us plot that a little bit better.
BrianMiller: Yes. The second half of the year, obviously, will include -- we only had a partial quarter of NIC. So obviously, we grow in the second half from that. But I'd say, generally, we would expect -- and also with the trailing off of the NIC COVID-related revenues in Q4, I think we'll see both of those quarters above, obviously, the second quarter level. But the third quarter will likely be our highest revenue quarter and a bit of a drop-off from Q3 to Q4 as the COVID business rolls off. So Q3 is likely to being the highest quarter in terms of both revenues and EPS. So there's a little bit different. Generally, our fourth quarter is the highest, but there's somewhat of an anomaly there.
Operator: The next question comes from Rob Oliver with Baird.
RobOliver: Great. Lynn, I'll start with one for you. You've cited the Colorado $9 million win, which included Entellitrak and NIC on AWS. That's kind of a great signature win there. And I'm just curious if you can maybe to a extent that you can walk us through a little bit. Was that -- I assume that was the Tyler contract in Origin, was NIC added on throughout the quarter? Maybe talk about some of the dynamics there. It seems like a nice template for pretty nice, meaningful subscription win here very early in the combination between the 2? And then I had a follow-up question as well.
LynnMoore: Yes, that's right, Rob. This is a Tyler contract from the get-go, and it was it really emanated from our -- the MicroPact acquisition, our Tyler Federal business. MicroPact had relationships with NIC even prior to our deal. And so it would not be unusual for them to have been in deals together. And so having them part of that is, as you say, it's a nice round out.  It also -- I think it highlights -- when we talk about a lot of these large deals, and I mentioned it in my remarks. And it really highlights the value of our acquisition strategy over the years. I mean, when you talk about -- that's a deal that -- it's our largest deal of the quarter. Well, that's our entellitrak that came from MicroPact. It includes Socrata, another recent acquisition, SceneDoc, the NIC payments. It includes our strategic alliance with AWS. It is kind of a showcase deal for the quarter. And again, I think, validates our acquisition strategy and how it plays in the market even as it may take time for us to sort of build up and get these larger contracts that really put us in a competitive position that makes it difficult for others to compete with.
RobOliver: Great. That's helpful. And then I just had a follow-up. I mean, you guys have been pretty clear that payments is really the area where you're kind of leading in terms of -- I don't want to say low-hanging fruit, because obviously it's not easy, but where you're kind of like leading the charge in terms of the integration. You did make a comment, I believe, Lynn, about the Florida master limited -- well, the Florida opportunity. And I know that with NIC sitting on 28 master enterprise contracts. Just curious for any early color or indications around receptivity towards kind of the products being sold in there. And I know also those states are being recipients of some funds now. So just curious for any color around that.
BrianMiller: No, that's a good point, Rob. And you're right. We talk a lot about payments, primarily because that was a big strategic initiative for Tyler before we even started talking with NIC. And what's interesting there is just how our -- as our teams get together, how complementary our products are and how the things that was on Tyler's development road map were things that really NIC had already not just done but perfected and things that Tyler had already had with their systems or things that NIC needed to do. But you're right, beyond payments, we talk about that a lot. But one of the things that makes us really excited is the ability to sell Tyler products through those state contracts and really leverage those NIC relationships. I mean, they've got very deep relationships at the highest levels of state government areas where really Tyler just didn't have access. And I'm talking about governors and senior decision makers. And you get in front of those people and we're able to get in front of those people and try to talk to them about what are you guys trying to get done, what policies are you pursuing, and whether it's economic development or HHS or prison reform or whatever it is, and we've got the solutions to do it. And that's really the crux of what we're doing with these weekly showcases with Tyler products. We have to educate all of these state -- the state GMs and the entire NIC executive team as to what our portfolio is really all about and how we can leverage that. And I don't want to minimize that because we talk a lot about payments, but that is something that we see as significant upside.
Operator: The next question comes from Jonathan Ho with William Blair & Company.
JonathanHo: Congratulations on the strong quarter. I just wanted to maybe dig into some of the billable travel or some of the lower-margin revenue that returned this quarter. Is there a way for you to maybe quantify for us maybe how much has returned and maybe what you expect in terms of, I guess, the rest of the year in terms of how that will come back?
BrianMiller: Yes. I don't have the number in front of me for billable travel. It's not significant. It's still well under what we typically did, which was about $5 million a quarter pre-COVID. It's probably on the order of 20% of that has come back. But it's come back a little sooner than we expected, just as we're starting to see employees coming back to the offices. Our customers are starting to want to see our salespeople and our implementation people in some instances back on site, and we still expect that we'll continue in most cases to deliver the majority of our implementation services remotely. There is a desire in an increasing number of customers to see people back on site. And so that's picked up even a little bit sooner than we expected. But certainly, well under half of what it was pre-COVID. Public safety is probably one of those areas because the -- our clients never went home. The first responders and -- those agencies continue to work, and so they're ready to have us back on site as well. So we're seeing a bit of that come back, but still well under the pre-COVID levels.
LynnMoore: Yes. And Jonathan, we're also -- we're doing things to try to incentivize more remote delivery of service as well in terms of pricing and things like that. And I think we're still trying to feel it out, as Brian said. The expectation is we will not go back to pre-COVID levels. There are parts of our business that really sort of still demand on site, as Brian mentioned, public safety. But on the others, we're going to work with our clients and working in different ways to try to bring that down.
JonathanHo: And then just in terms of trying to understand a little bit better the advantages of some of the statewide acquisition contracts that you've signed. Can you maybe help us understand how Tyler can leverage those contracts? And maybe what the advantages of having those contracts over a traditional RFP process? What can you do with those that you couldn't do before? And what does that sort of make easier in the contracting process?
LynnMoore: So you're talking about the NIC state contracts?
JonathanHo: Yes.
LynnMoore: Yes. So it's a couple of things. I mean those contracts that -- NIC has done an amazing job over the years. It takes them a little bit longer, but really of establishing contracts that are extremely open-ended and as we like to use the term hunting licenses. And so it allows those -- under those contracts to pursue a lot of different opportunities with a lot of different agencies and in some cases, even local jurisdictions. It allows them to push products. But more importantly, too, it also -- what they also bring is, as I just mentioned, is their deep relationships with different agencies and different higher execs at the state level, areas that where Tyler just didn't have any exposure. And so it's leveraging those relationships, leveraging Tyler's products, leveraging those open-ended contracts, really creates a whole new opportunity for Tyler that we've never seen before. An example would be we're having discussions with a particular state with some court solutions. And we're actually able to have conversations at an extremely high level at a place where Tyler traditionally just had not been able to do it. And those relationships are coming from those state contracts.  And I mentioned the state of Oregon and the State of Idaho as renewals for NIC. And what's important there is the Oregon contract, that's an extension, but that's an extension of a 10-year relationship. The Idaho contract is a 2-year extension on a 22-year relationship. So these are very deep relationships that NIC has done. Getting these renewals is something you don't take for granted, and you've got to continue to deliver value. And I think the flip side of that is what Tyler can bring is, as we continue to leverage those relationships and put more products, it will actually bring that more value to those contracts and further deepen those relationships so that those will continue to sustain and survive well into the future.
Operator: The next question comes from Keith Housum with North Coast Research.
KeithHousum: Just two questions for you. One on the IRS contract. I think I heard you say there's -- you're 1 of 2 vendors that have been picked. Can you perhaps provide more color, are you guys splitting the revenue and the payment process here? Or is there an opportunity to perhaps to expand that down the road?
LynnMoore: Yes. So you're right. So they went with 2 providers. No, it's not a partnership. What will be chosen is by the actual citizen or business who chooses to pay. It's not unlike there are certain areas with our e-filing where there we may be the -- there may be multiple people who are providing that service even though the back end is through Tyler. We'll be marketing and doing what we can, we'll be trying to provide the best service. What's interesting, though, is that prior to this contract, they had actually -- I think they had 4 vendors, none of which were selected here. There are 3 vendors. And both of us and the other vendor were new selections by the IRS.
KeithHousum: Great. Congratulations. And then looking at the NIC growth, obviously, that was a strong quarter for those guys. Was it more transactional based or would they -- are they having success with the platforms that they were developing prior to your purchase, the payments and the recreational elections and such?
LynnMoore: Yes. So I think they had -- as you mentioned, a really great quarter. I think the revenue was up around 19%. And really, they really outperformed in a couple of areas. Their state enterprise transaction revenue, which includes payments and also their outdoor licensing, their recreation.gov as more and more people are getting outdoors, it's just -- it's up significantly over a year ago. Obviously, we also mentioned the COVID-related services continue to outperform even as we expect those to taper off. But yes, it's that state enterprise transaction revenue related payments, outdoor licensing and COVID.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI.
KirkMaterne: All right. Lynn, can you just give us an update on how it's going in terms of moving more of your products over to AWS at this point in time. When do you think you can have maybe a plurality of products running on AWS and some of the benefits to the business model from them? I'm just trying to get a sense on how far along we are on that front.
LynnMoore: I'd say we're still in the early innings there. The expectation for me is, across our business lines, as we get into the second half of the year, we're going to start putting new clients there. We've still been over the last year, still been validating really sort of some of the costs. It's a project we call Lighthouse where we've got -- we're taking existing clients across all of our core apps and we're putting them in AWS, running them and verifying the costs and seeing -- obviously, we're doing things already to make changes to our products to make them run more efficient in AWS, but this also helps provide a road map. And I think as you see going into next year, you're going to continue to see movement of new business into AWS because the goal is to eventually move out of 2 Tyler data centers to 1. So we're going to need to start bringing that down. We'll start with new business and then we will probably start accelerating our -- we've already been accelerating our flips, but at some point, put together a more robust migration for existing. But I'd say, overall, we're still in the early innings. And I think we'd probably be in a more better position to report on that kind of progress really starting next year.
KirkMaterne: That's great. And then, Brian, just as sort of a point of clarification. I know you don't want to get anything '22 related at this point in time. But is it safe -- should we just be zeroing out the COVID-related revenue from NIC for '22 at this point in time? Is that sort of the -- what you would advise us as we start thinking ahead to next year? I know you don't want to give anything formal, but it seems like that revenue is going to be pretty immaterial next year.
BrianMiller: Yes, that's our expectation now, that there won't be anything there next year.
LynnMoore: And to be honest, Kirk, that's my hope because that means that COVID is going away.
KirkMaterne: Me, too. So it's all over [Indiscernible] All right. Congrats on the quarter.
Operator: And we have a follow-up from Matt VanVliet with BTIG.
MattVanVliet: Brian, just one quick follow-up. You mentioned the cash flow impact from some of the previously collected but then remitted funds for NIC post close. Could you just give us a sense for the magnitude there and how much it actually impacted cash flow in the quarter?
BrianMiller: Yes, that was about $55 million, how much the reduction from the liability we had on the books for funds payable to clients, how much that went down from the time of acquisition to the end of the quarter. So pretty significant impact. That's just money that's passing through. So over the course of a longer period of time, that impact is 0. It comes in and goes out. But just the timing of it relative to what was on their balance sheet at the time of the acquisition and paid shortly afterwards, ran through our cash flow statement to the tune of about $55 million.
LynnMoore: Yes, the gross versus net payments primarily, which also impacts margins.
BrianMiller: Yes. Passing through us.
Operator: The next question comes from Joe Goodwin with JMP Securities.
JoeGoodwin: Congrats on the quarter. Just a quick question on the master contracts. Great to see the renewals come through. But I guess now that NIC is combined with Tyler, does that motion of actually securing net new contracts or just new contracts with these states changed at all? Any commentary there would be great.
LynnMoore: I don't think there's a fundamental change in that process. And like I said, what I believe will happen over time is NIC, as I said, they've done a great job of building these relationships. These are all very long-term relationships. They got to continue to deliver value. And what I think will happen over time is that as Tyler is able to enhance that value, it will only -- I think it will only help to facilitate those renewals in the future.
Operator: At this time, there appear to be no more questions, Mr. Moore. So I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.
Lynn Moore: Great. Thanks, Andrew, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. We certainly hope you stay safe and healthy, and if you have any further questions or follow-up, please feel free to reach out to Brian Miller or myself. Thanks, everybody.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-29 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello and welcome to today's Tyler Technologies First Quarter 2021 Conference Call. Your host for today's call is Lynn Moore, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, April 29, 2021. I would like to turn the call over now to Mr. Moore. Please go ahead.
Lynn Moore: Thank you, Keith, and welcome to our call. With me today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like for Brian to give the safe harbor statement. Next, I will have some preliminary comments on our quarter results, and then Brian will review the details. I will end with some additional comments, and then we'll take questions. Brian?
Brian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. During the course of this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information and may include projections concerning the company's future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We'd refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless we specify otherwise. Lynn?
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. Our first quarter results exceeded our expectations, providing an exceptional start to 2021. Recurring revenues, which comprised 75% of our first quarter revenues, were strong, led by a 25% growth in subscription revenues. However, software licenses and services revenues continue to be pressured by longer sales cycles and delays in projects as clients deal with the ongoing effects of the pandemic. A favorable revenue mix with strong subscription growth, coupled with cost efficiencies, drove a 270 basis point expansion of our non-GAAP operating margin to 26.8%. Cash flow continued to be very robust as cash from operations grew 26% and free cash flow grew almost 34%. We're pleased to see signs of growing activity in our public sector markets and expect that federal stimulus under the American Rescue Plan Act will have a positive impact on government technology spending going forward. Bookings in the first quarter were solid at approximately $247 million, but were down 22.8% against a very challenging comparison with the first quarter of 2020. Our largest deal in the quarter was a SaaS arrangement for our Munis ERP solution with the City of Fresno, California valued at approximately $10 million. Other significant SaaS contracts included ERP deals with Hall County, Georgia, and Fort Smith, Arkansas. And an Odyssey Courts deal with Val Verde County, Texas. Our largest on-premises contracts include an ExecuTime time contract with the U.S. Virgin Islands, Public Safety and Brazos citations contracts with Montgomery County, New York, and Cicero, Illinois, and an EnerGov contract with the Commonwealth of The Bahamas. So far this year, we've been busy on the M&A front. On March 31, we completed 2 tuck-in acquisitions, DataSpec and ReadySub, for a total purchase price of $12 million in cash. DataSpec is a market-leading provider of software for the electronic management of veterans' claims. DataSpec's web-based Software-as-a-Service system called VetraSpec allows for secure electronic claims submission to the Federal Department of Veterans Affairs and reporting capabilities, in addition to scheduling, calendaring and payments. DataSpec offers county, state and national versions of VetraSpec, with state solutions making up majority of its implementations. The solution allows state departments to execute and analyze reports on the entire state, individual offices, regions and districts, and individual users. ReadySub is a cloud-based platform that delivers comprehensive absence and substitute teacher management solutions, serving approximately 1,000 school districts across the United States, with only approximately 20 of which overlapping with Tyler's 2,000 school district clients. The solution helps districts with the labor-intensive and demanding task of filling both planned and unplanned staff absences with the most highly qualified substitute resources. With continuous pressure due to substitute teacher shortages, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, districts can more easily retain a pool of qualified substitutes and automate the searching and filing of needed substitute spots. Additionally, ReadySub can integrate districts' payroll processes, eliminating duplicate work and streamlining related payroll tasks. Most importantly, last week, we completed the $2.3 billion cash acquisition of NIC, a leading digital government solutions and payments company that serves more than 7,100 federal, state and local government agencies across the nation. NIC delivers user-friendly digital services that make it easier and more efficient for citizens and businesses to interact with government, providing valuable conveniences like applying for unemployment insurance, submitting business filings, renewing licenses, accessing information and making secure payments without visiting a government office. In addition, NIC has extensive experience and expertise and scale in the government payments area, processing more than $24 billion in payments on behalf of citizens and governments last year, which will accelerate Tyler's strategic payments initiative. With the addition of NIC's highly complementary industry-leading digital government solutions and payment services to Tyler's broad client base and multiple sales channels, the combined company will be well equipped to address the tremendous demand at the federal, state and local levels for innovative platform services. Together, Tyler and NIC will connect data and processes across disparate systems and deliver essential products and services to all public sector stakeholders. NIC had revenues of $460.5 million and net income of $68.6 million in 2020. While NIC will cease to be an SEC reporting company, and therefore, will not issue a first quarter earnings release, they also had a very strong first quarter results that exceeded their plan. NIC's core first quarter revenues, excluding the TourHealth and COVID initiatives that are expected to wind down after the second quarter, grew more than 10% over last year. In addition, NIC's operating income, again excluding the TourHealth and COVID initiatives as well as acquisition costs, rose more than 20%. We are thrilled to welcome the more than 1,000 talented employees of NIC, DataSpec and ReadySub to the Tyler family, and look forward to realizing the tremendous benefits these transactions can bring to our collective team members and clients and to Tyler shareholders. Now, I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter.
Brian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2021. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results in comparison with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the investor relations section of our website under the financial reports tab schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. Both GAAP and non-GAAP revenues for the quarter were $294.8 million, up 6.6% on a GAAP basis and 6.5% on a non-GAAP basis. As you may recall, we were off to a very strong start in the first 2 months of 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic began to significantly affect our business in March. So we're generally pleased with our growth this quarter against that comparison. Software license revenues declined 20.3%, reflecting both extended sales cycles and a high mix of subscription deals at 66% of new software contract value. Software services revenue declined 8.6% as a result of the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and our shift to remote delivery of most services resulted in a decline in billable travel revenue. On the positive side, subscription revenues rose 25.4%. We added 84 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 39 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $52 million in total contract value. In Q1 of last year, we added 131 new subscription-based arrangements and had 19 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $98 million in total contract value. Subscription contract value comprised approximately 66% of total new software contract value signed this quarter, compared to 73% in Q1 of last year. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 4.0 years compared to 5.9 years last year. Revenues from e-filing and online payments, which are included in subscriptions, were $26.9 million, up 22.4%. That amount includes e-filing revenue of $15.6 million, up 4.8%, and e-payments revenue of $11.3 million, up 59.3%. For the first quarter, our annualized non-GAAP total recurring revenue, or ARR, was approximately $886 million, up 12.9%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS arrangements for Q1 was approximately $302 million, up 26.3%. Transaction-based ARR was approximately $108 million, up 22.4%, and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was approximately $476 million, up 4.1%. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $1.55 billion, up 3%. As Lynn noted, our bookings in the quarter were solid at $247 million. However, this was down 22.8% compared to a difficult comparison to Q1 of last year. Last year's first quarter bookings included several large contracts, including 2 significant follow-on SaaS deals with the North Carolina courts, with a combined contract value of approximately $38 million. For the trailing 12-month bookings were approximately $1.2 billion, down 13.3%, although they do not include the majority of the $98 million extension of our Texas e-filing contract signed in Q4 of 2020, because of certain termination provisions in that contract. If the Texas e-filing renewal was fully included, trailing 12-month bookings would have been down only 6.4%. The prior trailing 12-month bookings also included 4 significant SaaS deals with the North Carolina courts, with a combined contract value of approximately $123 million. The bookings growth rate in Q1 was also affected by a shorter average term for new subscription contracts. Our software subscription bookings in the first quarter added $10.2 million in new annual recurring revenue. Cash flow was once again very strong in the first quarter as cash from operations increased 26.4% to $71.7 million and free cash flow grew 33.9% to $61.7 million, representing an all-time high for first quarter free cash flow. We financed the NIC acquisition with a mixture of debt at very attractive rates that gives us a flexible capital structure. In March, we completed a $600 million offering of 0.25% convertible senior notes due 2026. The notes are convertible into Tyler common stock at a conversion price of $493.44, which represents a 30% premium over our closing price on March 4. On April 21, concurrent with the closing of the NIC acquisition, we entered into a new $1.4 billion senior unsecured credit facility with a group of 8 banks. The facility includes a $300 million term note due in 2024 and a $600 million term note due in 2026, both of which can be prepaid without penalty. The facility also includes a new 5-year $500 million revolving credit agreement that replaces our prior $400 million revolver. The combination of the convertible debt, term notes and revolver provide us with a great deal of flexibility. Our balance sheet remains very strong and its pro forma net leverage at the NIC closing was approximately 3.2 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. And we expect to end the year with net leverage under 2.5 times. The current blended interest rate on the $1.75 billion of debt we have outstanding today is 1.1%. We remain on track to achieve or exceed the annual revenue and EPS guidance that we communicated in February for Tyler, excluding the impact of the NIC acquisition. As Lynn mentioned, NIC also had a very strong first quarter results that exceeded their plans. We expect the NIC acquisition will be accretive to our non-GAAP earnings and EBITDA as well as to our recurring revenue mix and free cash flow per share in 2021. Because of antitrust restrictions, we took a conservative approach to our integration and strategic planning for NIC prior to closing the transaction last week. We are currently working closely with NIC's leadership to evaluate strategic growth opportunities that take advantage of the combined strengths of the 2 businesses and determine the impact on our 2021 plan. We expect to complete the fine-tuning of our joint operating and financial plans for the remainder of the year and issue 2021 guidance for the combined company during the second quarter. Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Lynn.
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. Our team of professionals, including our new NIC team members, executed at a high level in the first quarter, driving results that surpassed expectations for both Tyler and NIC, and provided a great start to 2021. Exiting 2020, our financial position was stronger than ever, allowing us to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions, including NIC, the largest acquisition in our history with a purchase price of $2.3 billion in cash. We've also been able to continue to invest in and, in some cases, accelerate all of our long-term strategic initiatives, in particular, our shift to a cloud-first approach. As a result, our competitive position has also continued to strengthen. We believe we will continue to see an acceleration of the public sector's move to the cloud, and we are in a great position to support that move. I'm happy to say that we are on track with the strategic investments in optimizing our products for the cloud that we discussed on our fourth quarter call. This quarter, we saw early indicators that our market is beginning to recover as some delayed procurement processes are moving forward and RFP activity is growing from the levels of the second half of 2020. We also expect that the $350 billion of aid to state and local governments under the American Rescue Plan Act will provide a significant measure of relief to budget pressures faced by many of our clients and prospects, and have a positive impact on recovery of our markets. One topic I've not discussed on these calls before pertains to our efforts regarding environmental and social initiatives. Tyler's culture guides our commitment to being a responsible partner in the communities where we live, work and serve our clients. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Tyler Foundation, which since its creation has provided millions of dollars to charities and causes that positively impact our communities. Our culture is also the foundation for our belief in the importance of providing an inclusive and diverse workplace. We are proud to have been included in the Forbes America's Best Employers for Diversity list for the past 2 consecutive years. The pause in normal office occupancy and business travel due to the pandemic provided an opportunity for us to evaluate our environmental impact across our major office locations and identify opportunities to make our practices more consistent and effective. Last year, we formed an environmental task force to strengthen our sustainability efforts across our office locations and the communities we impact. We achieved a significant milestone last year by responding to Tyler's first invitation to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index survey. More than 3,500 of the world's largest publicly-listed companies provide detailed data and background to this global survey for evaluation by its independent sustainability ranking body. Completing the survey was an important opportunity for Tyler to uncover opportunities to strengthen our core responsibility strategy. We recently published our second annual corporate responsibility report, which is available on our website. This report represents a significant expansion of our reporting on our ESG efforts. And we look forward to continuing our journey and sharing our progress in this area. Finally, this week, we are virtually hosting more than 5,000 clients at Connect 2021, our annual user conference with a theme called Virtually Possible. Team members from across Tyler are providing nearly 700 hours of valuable content for our clients using our advanced virtual event platform. We are excited to be able to connect with so many clients at our virtual event, and we look forward to connecting with them in person at Connect 2022. With that, we'd like to open up the line for Q&A.
Operator: Yes, thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Matt VanVliet from BTIG.
Matt VanVliet: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Really appreciate it. I guess as you look at some of the commentary you talked about, about slower sales cycles, but really starting to pick up maybe at the end of the quarter, curious what the federal aid bill kind of points to. Are there any specific areas in your business that you think will have particular earmarks of spending? Are there any limitations that you've seen in the bill so far? Just kind of help us out with where you think the biggest upside will be across the portfolio.
Lynn Moore: Yeah. Thanks, Matt. That's a good question. I think right now there's still - our clients generally know the money is there. There is still a little bit of uncertainty about how to access it. There is certainly money that's been earmarked for IT modernization efforts. And so, I think what it's done is it's given our clients a little bit more confidence. I don't know that, I would say it necessarily benefits one more than the other. Although one thing that we were noticing last year was in our state business and that - our state business was off quite a bit last year, and there was a little bit of uncertainty around there. As it turns out, a lot of the state budgets were not as impacted as they first thought a year ago. And so, I think the combination of that along with this American Rescue Plan funding is providing a boost in that state area. We're starting to see that with some of the RFPs and things that we knew that were intended to come out that got delayed and we're starting to see some of that. But I'd say, across our entire product lines, I think there is reason for I'd call cautious optimism in what's going on in the markets, and a big part of that is the American Rescue Plan.
Brian Miller: And I would just add to that on the Rescue Plan that, the CARES Act, the first stimulus, couldn't be used by governments to replace lost revenue. And it was roughly $150 billion for states and just $150 billion for the largest cities and counties. This $350 billion goes much deeper across states and local governments. And there are very few restrictions on what it can be used for. The funding is just now becoming available to governments. Half of it available roughly now within 60 days of when it was passed. And then the other half is available 12 months from now. So we wouldn't have expected to see much impact on customers' purchasing activities and buying decisions yet. But it certainly points to an opportunity as we move through the year to provide significant relief.
Matt VanVliet: It's very helpful. And then, I guess just following up on sort of the stages of integration for NIC, from a product standpoint and the ability to sort of up-sell, cross-sell both across your customer base and then into theirs, what should we expect in terms of timing? Is there any real heavy lifting to get the products to be fully integrated? Is there anything that needs to be done from a technical standpoint to push their payments platform into your local governments, maybe just how you're thinking about kind of that process from a more technical and sort of product standpoint?
Lynn Moore: Yeah, sure, Matt. I'd say a couple of things. As we mentioned in our comments, we're really just now beginning to sort of dig deep into our integration efforts and our strategic initiatives. And in fact, this week, we had the senior executives of both companies meeting face-to-face for the first time, which was exciting, and really start brainstorming. And at a high level, we already know sort of some of the major initiatives that we want to take on. And the good news is there are a lot of initiatives. And one thing that we need to do and be careful about is make sure that we prioritize them, look at some of the low-hanging fruit and look at some of the things that will have the most impact. You mentioned payments. That certainly is one of our largest initiatives. From a technical standpoint, there is still a little bit of work to do there. But NIC is the unquestioned leader in payments in the public sector at the state level, and it's a growing thing for us. What we see there is the ability to leverage our client base and get payments more at the local level and leverage their technical experience to help boost our payments. We talked about other sort of integrations and things. We talked before about their state enterprise contracts, which provide sort of hunting licenses. And in fact, it's those state contracts, which they classify as state enterprise revenues, where they go in and then they sort of - they plant a seed and then they're able to go build additional revenues from there. On their own, this first quarter, those revenues were up 20%, which is pretty exciting. And then, what we start talking about is what kind of products do we have at Tyler that we can really just go in and push there. And I don't think there's a lot of technical integration there that's going to need to be done. But that's another one of our major initiatives that we're looking at right now.
Matt VanVliet: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Scott Berg with Needham & Company.
Scott Berg: Hey, Lynn and Brian, thanks for taking my questions, I guess, I got 2 here. First of all, Lynn, obviously, COVID is still impacting your businesses, as it is several in my coverage universe. But as I look at deal flow in the quarter, it looks like your new subscription contracts were - at 84 was substantially weaker than what we've seen at least over the last 2 or 3 quarters. I guess, as you look at that business, any product area, in particular, kind of driving maybe some of the softness in the quarter versus license sales, which was pretty much in line with last couple of quarters?
Lynn Moore: Yeah, Scott. We talked about it last year. The expectation really was that, I guess I'd sort of call it the COVID hangover, would bleed into this year, and a lot of it has to do with the fact that our clients' budget cycles are July 1, June 30. And it's a good question. But at the same time, these are the deals that we've signed. And what we're starting to see is, in Q1, for example, we're starting to see more RFPs, we're starting to see more demos, and we're actually - some of the awards that we've gotten in Q1 that are not signed are actually starting to skew even more heavily toward SaaS. We don't normally talk about unsigned awards. We talked last year about how COVID was impacting different parts of our business differently. And we saw a little bit greater impact, say, more on the high-end financials, where Munis is, where a lot of our license sales are. And what we've seen so far in Q1 actually is that the awards that we're getting and the deals that are coming in are skewing at 80-plus percent to SaaS right now. So I think that overall trend that we've talked about is still going on. There's just a little bit of lumpiness and a little bit of hangover still from COVID.
Scott Berg: Got it. You actually targeted a little bit. My second question was on those unsigned awards. Brian, we talked about that obviously over the last 6 or 7 years. There is certainly some variance from quarter-to-quarter. As you look at those unsigned awards, was that number, I guess, coming out of Q1, materially higher than what you've seen in the last couple of quarters? Or was it kind of in line with that similar amount?
Brian Miller: I'd say it's a little bit higher. As Lynn said, we saw these pauses in procurement processes in second quarter of last year, third quarter of last year, even to the fourth quarter of last year, where RFP volumes were down. Our clients were adapting to remote work. We weren't able to do in-person demos and some clients wanted to - it took a little while longer to adapt to doing a lot of those things remotely. So there were these pauses and delays in sales processes, particularly early-stage sales processes last year. And given our normal sales cycles that are 9 months to a year in typical deals, we expect that would show up in bookings now as we move into the fourth quarter, the first quarter of this year, those delays. And so, really our pipeline is still very robust. The RFP activity is picking up. So as we've said all along, it's really a matter of timing. We haven't seen deals go away. We've just seen the timing pushed out, and it's not surprising that it's showing up. And given that more of the deals are skewing toward subscription, it's more evident in the lower subscription bookings than in the license deals.
Scott Berg: Got it. That's all I have. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Rob Oliver with Baird.
Robert Oliver: Great. Thank you, guys, for taking my question. Lynn, one for you. I just want to go back to the, I think, Matt's initial question on the American Rescue Plan. Obviously, sizable amounts of money flowing into local municipal, I think, Brian, you had mentioned that there weren't as many restrictions on the money. Some of our conversations are still, I guess, there are still some uncertainty about how exactly this is going to be spent. One area, in particular, where we're hearing it's green-lighted in schools, and that's I think a noisier market than it's been in the past. But I know you mentioned you guys have 2,000 customers there, ReadySub tuck-ins, seems like it's really perfectly timed just as that was a nightmare to manage moving through COVID. But just curious, if you guys can just kind of frame the schools' opportunity or maybe any other early indications of that "growing activity” you're seeing, as those ARP funds are hitting and people are starting to do projects.
Lynn Moore: Yeah, Rob, that's a good point you make and you're right. We talked about it last year, how, again, the impact of COVID did impact different parts of our business differently. While we had certain areas of our business, I just mentioned the higher-end ERP, schools was an area that was definitely impacted a lot. And our business in schools was off last year. At the same time, I also mentioned last quarter that last year was a record sales year in our courts business. So it's a little bit of a - it's just different across our business. You're right, the American Rescue Plan, I do expect - there are some money that's specifically targeted for K through 12 and higher education. I think there is about $160 million, $170 million targeted for that. And I think what we're starting to see, generally, is just the more receptiveness from our clients in the schools area in terms of getting RFPs out, in terms of talking about deals. There was a - I'd say there was an area last year where it was, I wouldn't say silenced, but it was certainly muted a little bit, and that's certainly coming back.
Robert Oliver: Great. Yeah, sorry - go ahead.
Lynn Moore: And to your point about ReadySub, you're right. That's a really exciting opportunity for us. It's kind of a small deal. And it's a deal that's not just you want substitute teacher application that can go in. It's also becoming more - that type of application is becoming more and more of a requirement in our ERP space for schools. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we have over 2,000 school clients. And right now, that application is only in about 20 of them. And it's sort of the same playbook we had several years ago, we did the ExecuTime acquisition. We expect that we're going to be able to grow that product pretty well and it will be great for our inside sales channels as well as new business.
Robert Oliver: That's helpful. Thanks, Lynn. I appreciate it. And then, Brian, just a quick follow-up for you. Conversions were up really nicely year-over-year. Is that a function of things having frozen maybe in March and comp being easier or customers more willing to convert to subscription or kind of a mixture of the both? I know you guys are obviously leaning in more on subscription and subscription first, but just wanted to get a better handle on the dynamic there. Thank you.
Brian Miller: Yes, it's really more the latter. The last 2 quarters have been really strong in terms of conversions picking back up again. And I think that's consistent with what we see in the new business market with more and more customers wanting to move to the subscription of the SaaS model. And as we've said, the complications of trying to remotely access some of these systems has certainly risen to the forefront during COVID and increased customers' desires to move on-premises systems into the cloud. And our relationship with AWS, our capacity that we have available through AWS and - is giving us additional ability to push conversions more aggressively into our customer base.
Robert Oliver: Great. Thanks again, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research.
Keith Housum: Good morning, guys. If I could unpack the backlog number just a little bit more. It looks like the - or I'm sorry, the bookings number, it looks like for services actually, the services bookings actually went down by about $25 million in the quarter. Was there a cancellation in the quarter?
Brian Miller: No cancellations, but you're talking about compared to last year?
Keith Housum: Yeah, I think the $247 million you have in new bookings for the quarter, it looks like software and service bookings were actually down by $25 million.
Brian Miller: Yeah, I think part of that is billable travel that runs through revenue and therefore through bookings. Last year, we were still traveling through most of the quarter, so you're going to see part of that. That's probably about $5 million of it. I'd say that, in general, the - as we move more to a cloud business, you typically see a little bit lower level of services with new cloud contracts. But I'd say most of that just goes along with the delays in some of the bookings. So along with - both on the license and subscription side, but no, we have not seen any cancellations. There have been - that's really held true throughout the whole last year. We've not seen any meaningful cancellations, either of contracts that are in progress or of projects in the pipeline, really just delays.
Keith Housum: Okay, got you. And if I could unpack the NIC numbers just a little bit more, it sounds like it was better than expected. If I heard what you say right revenue was up, excluding the one-offs of TourHealth and the Virginia pandemic assistance program more than 10%. But yet, I think you said the enterprise revenue was up 20%. How was the transaction revenue for NIC last year - last quarter?
Lynn Moore: Yeah, Keith, they're interactive governance services, which is, as you know, is transaction-based, that was up 16% year-over-year. So in the areas where they're really strategic and growing, they really had a really good solid first quarter.
Keith Housum: Great. Glad to see that. Hey, Lynn, you don't happen to have the DHR numbers as well, do you?
Lynn Moore: DHR was actually...
Keith Housum: Driver history records?
Lynn Moore: Yeah. No, I know DHR, I'm going off memory here. I believe DHR was up about 4% in the quarter, give or take, which was nice to see, given that I think it was the first time they've actually increased in the quarter and maybe 4 quarters. But, as you know, that revenue is probably more stable. And again, when you look at interactive government services, they're [same store] [ph] enterprise revenues, that's really their growth drivers. And those were up nicely in Q1.
Keith Housum: Yeah, absolutely great. I appreciate it. Thanks for the color, guys. Good luck.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Peter Levine with Evercore.
Peter Levine: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. So with the move towards cloud, we've seen obviously in the corporate side acceleration of cloud based on the idea that some employees will be given the flexibility of work-from-home, hybrid. Obviously, cloud helps to enable that. Curious, if you're seeing or hearing similar trends on the public sector side, I'm sure there's a certain segment of public employees that could permanently be remote. But just curious now, could this be a catalyst to accelerate cloud adoption?
Brian Miller: Sorry. You weren't coming through very clearly. Could you repeat the last part of the question?
Peter Levine: Yeah. Sorry about that. Yeah, just curious to know, does - public employees, right? We've seen the trends on the corporate side where cloud acceleration with the idea that some employees will be given the flexibility, right? So obviously, cloud helps that. But curious to know, based on your conversations, are you hearing or seeing similar trends on the public sector side? What the idea is that could this potentially be a catalyst to accelerate cloud?
Brian Miller: Yeah, I think, that's definitely true. Typically, you will see the public sector change and evolve more slowly than the private sector. So often those things that - those trends that start in the private sector take a little bit longer to take hold in the public sector. But just like the private sector, our clients have had to move to doing things remotely, and that is, I think, a significant factor in their ongoing preference in new systems for the cloud and in the conversions from on-premise customers accelerating. Courts is a great example where courthouses were physically closed and many of them still remain closed, but courts are an essential function. And so many courts that didn't have the ability to operate their systems remote were just shut down. And we have products, for example, our virtual courts product that we accelerated bringing to market early last year that enabled courts to continue to operate remotely, licensing and permitting functions where clients have old legacy - not our clients, but public sector agencies have old legacy systems that don't allow for remote access. So you don't have people in the office processing building permits and those sorts of things that are slowing down activity. Our systems provide for that remote access, and there's certainly an accelerated interest in those. So I think, yeah, governments will, like the private sector over time look to work more remotely, and also that's a factor with NIC, the ability to interact with government and make payments remotely or online rather than coming to a government office. And as we've talked about their first quarter results, we're certainly seeing that increase in volumes as a result of that trend.
Peter Levine: Yeah, great color. And then Lynn, to piggyback off your prior comments on government budgets and the spending bill, any more detailed commentary you can share on whether state and local government budgets are opening up, I would say, more uniformly? Or is it more of a state-by-state situation?
Lynn Moore: I don't know that I could attribute necessarily anything geographic. I would just say, generally, as a whole, we're seeing a lot of positive signs. We talked about on-site awards. We talked about RFPs, particularly in certain areas of our business. Take, for example, in the higher-end financials, our fees are up significantly over Q3 and Q4, even while they're still down from where they would have been pre-pandemic, and so that's an encouraging sign. There were a lot of big deals that we saw maybe in our appraisal space maybe in our state space that we knew these deals, we plan on these deals coming out in 2020. And those got shut down, and we're actually starting to see those getting released. So just generally speaking, it's - there's a lot of encouragement. Again, I wouldn't say we're quite over the hump yet, but let's get another quarter of seeing this activity, but I think there's general optimism. And I think it mirrors what's going on in the country. There should be a reason for optimism as people continue to get vaccinated, as businesses continue to open up, as money continues to start flowing, people start interacting. You're going to see that flow through our business as well.
Peter Levine: Great. And if I could squeeze 1 more in. Sorry, Brian, if I missed it, I hopped on late. But how are you thinking about the combined financials? And what impact, I guess, if any - I guess, specifically the write-down of NIC's deferred revenue could have here in 2021?
Brian Miller: We're still working through all that process. That's 1 of the reasons we aren't providing the combined guidance at this time. I would say, in general, NIC doesn't have a large deferred revenue balance on their balance sheet. Their business is more transaction-based rather than software-based. But that's certainly 1 of the factors that we're looking at closely as we develop the combined guidance. But they do tend to have less deferred revenue than, say, a pure software company.
Peter Levine: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Jonathan Ho with William Blair & Company.
Jonathan Ho: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to - I guess, I'll make sure I fully understand this. So would you expect this quarter to potentially be the low watermark in terms of maybe year-over-year bookings growth? And do you potentially anticipate that there'll be a catch-up period once the pipeline starts to normalize even more so than it is today.
Brian Miller: Well, it's hard to tell exactly if it's a low watermark, but we did start to see declining bookings last year in Q2. So I think our comparisons will now be against a - start to compare against pandemic-affected quarters. So really, right now, we're comparing against what was not only the last sort of pre-pandemic or pre-affected quarter, unaffected quarter, but also what was just a very strong quarter with some large deals in it. We do think there would be a catch-up. It's not likely to be sort of a dramatic 1 quarter kind of a catch-up, but the combination of, 1, the fact that these are essential systems and that the pipeline - they remain in the pipeline, the timing has just been pushed out. So, again, we're starting to see that increase in activity, those RFPs starting to pick-up again and some of those deals moving forward. So we do believe there's a catch-up. It is just a matter of timing. As we've said before, we also believe that further down the road, that the - there will be some procurements that will be accelerated that might have been - clients might have thought they had years left in existing legacy systems and the need for remote access, security concerns around some of those legacy systems will be factors that will cause them to rethink that and accelerate the replacement of those systems. They'll still need to go through buying processes. They'll still need to budget those, but we do believe that there'll be a longer-term acceleration, but that the sort of pent-up demand in the current pipeline that there will be an acceleration as that works its way out. And that would be consistent with what we saw in, for example, in the recession a decade ago.
Lynn Moore: Jonathan, I'd just add there, too, that - I like to look at the trends and look at the markets. And again, there's reason to believe the market is starting to come back. We talked about the Great Recession, but also what's our competitiveness disposition like in that market. And even while in the last 6, 9 months that the markets have been off a little bit, our actual win rates have actually been climbing. And so our competitive position continues to grow. And as we look at bookings, we've talked about this a lot over the years, we have a pretty steady stream, but it's always - there can always be some large skews in various quarters, because we do have parts of our business that get some really large deals. Last year, we were a little concerned about Q2 of last year, because Q2 of 2019, we had, I think, 1 of our largest deals in Tyler's history. And so that's kind of what we're competing against. And those large lumpy - those large deals will always sort of throw off a little bookings number. But when I look back at sort of the underlying thing, what's the market doing, what's our competitive position, what's our win rates, that's all trending in the direction that we'd like to see.
Jonathan Ho: That's helpful. Just 1 question on DataSpec and ReadySub. How do you think about cross-selling those products and leveraging them across your existing clients? And maybe how big of an opportunity could these acquisitions be? Thank you.
Lynn Moore: Yeah. So I'd say, they're a little bit different, the 2 acquisitions. They're both fairly small. ReadySub like I mentioned earlier, that's probably more like the playbook out of ExecuTime. And that's a - this is cloud-native platform. It's built in AWS. It's actually the founders of former AWS engineers. There's a clear need in that space. This is something that, to your point, we can go out and we can leverage and sell across our base pretty well. I don't know that I've got some good sort of markets for that, but it's an opportunity. And again, it's not just the opportunity of rolling out through our inside sales, but it will also help our competitiveness on new deals in the schools market as it's becoming more and more of a requirement. DataSpec, I would classify it as a little bit more of a consolidation play. They were probably the leader in the veterans' benefits application space. They had 32 state customers. That gives us a lot of credibility so that we can go out as we will eventually probably migrate those customers over to our entellitrak platform, and that just makes us the leader in that space and gives us more credibility as we look to expand in the federal markets as well as the state markets.
Jonathan Ho: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Charlie Strauzer with CJS Securities.
Charles Strauzer: Hi, good morning. Just a quick question for you. I know you're still working through guidance on NIC, but hoping to get a little bit more color there, and also maybe timing as to when you think this quarter, you should be releasing the updated guidance at all. Thanks.
Brian Miller: Well, we've said we'd expect to release it during the quarter. I would expect that to be roughly the end of May, beginning of June. So sometime in the next month or so, we would expect to be in a position to do that. NIC, again, we're working through not only understanding what their current plans are for the year, but really how the integration with Tyler, the ability to start to address some of our strategic initiatives and cross-selling opportunities, and what we think the timing and size of those is and how much of that will go into this year. But they're off to a strong start. As we said, overall, 10% - a little above 10% growth in their core revenues, they actually on the COVID-related revenues, significantly exceeded their plan on those, but we do expect those to wind down and not really be much of a factor after the second quarter. So their growth rate is a bit ahead of ours. And we talked about some of the strengths in their business from taking advantage of the increased desire of individuals and businesses to interact with governments digitally rather than in-person. So generally, they have a positive outlook on the year. And within the next few weeks, we expect to have that combined guidance out and be able to talk more about the plans for working together through this year.
Lynn Moore: Yeah, Charlie, if I could just add there, too, I think - yeah, I mean, this is obviously - it's a top priority, right? I mean, it's our largest acquisition of all time. And we talked a little bit about before, and I think Brian mentioned in his remarks, we were in this period from signing and close this regulatory approval period. And you can take all sorts of approaches there, and we tended to take a more conservative approach. And, I'd love to be able to share those numbers with you today. But it was because of that conservative approach, we're just not quite there yet. And the way I view it is we - Tyler very well. You follow us a long time. We're always interested in the long-term. And the thought of even potentially jeopardizing or delaying that deal by getting a few weeks head start on some of the stuff, it just didn't seem worth it. But it is a top priority. I think we'll get those numbers out, as Brian said, in about a month. But we know that it's going to be accretive to earnings. We know it's going to accretive to EBITDA and all the things we mentioned before and the excitements there. And I appreciate if there's even a little bit of frustration, and part of it's just the timing around that we just closed in our earnings releases now. If we closed a month before earnings release, we've probably been ready to do this.
Charles Strauzer: Totally understand. Thank you for that.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Peter Heckmann with D. A. Davidson.
Peter Heckmann: Hey, good morning. I understand, I would be looking forward to the combined guidance here in a few weeks, so I'll hold my questions on that until then. But just curious on the balance sheet, I mean, Tyler generates really strong cash flow. But would you expect to direct virtually all of free cash flow to debt reduction until you get to some threshold limit or - and refrain from the buyback in the interim?
Lynn Moore: I don't think there's necessarily a predisposition towards that. I think we're always opportunistic. And I think, at this point in time, acquisitions, we've done 3. Acquisitions will probably need to be a little more compelling. I'm not suggesting that we're done with acquisitions for the year, I think, I mentioned that on Q1. We talked a lot about NIC, and I said we may not be done for the year, and we did DataSpec and ReadySub. Those were deals that were already in process. And so I would expect that we'll be a little more - we may have a little bit higher bar, going forward, in the short term on that. And as it relates to share repurchases, again, we're opportunistic. We're very comfortable with our debt leverage right now. One of the things I talked about at the last quarter - at the last call was we want to make sure we retain flexibility. And I think we have that flexibility. And our combined cash flow, if we did solely dedicate it to debt, it would be paid off in fairly short order. But I always want to maintain the flexibility to invest in the business when it makes sense to do acquisitions when they make sense and to do share repurchase when they make sense. And we've got that. And so you'll see us pay down that debt in a fairly aggressive manner, but we're going to have that flexibility, and we'll open, we'll always have that flexibility.
Peter Heckmann: Okay. That's fair. And then, Brian, this may be jumping the gun to you with the question. But in terms of when NIC renews a state portal contract or any large contract, would you expect to see them flow through bookings? Or would it be like the Texas e-filing deal where there's - it's a little bit harder to quantify it given some of the terms?
Brian Miller: Yeah, it's probably a little early to comment on that. We really need to dig into the terms of those. Typically, when we've had contracts that are solely transaction-based like our e-filing that are on a per filing basis, they don't go into bookings at the inception. They just go in as those revenues flow through our income statement, because there's not a fixed amount. It's really just our fixed fee e-filing that goes into booking, other than in the case of the Texas renewal. So we'll just have to look closely at the terms of those contracts and see how they line up with how we report. So that's part of what we'll be doing as we move through the detailed integration over the - as we prepare to report for the first time on a combined basis this quarter.
Peter Heckmann: Okay. No problem. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler.
Clarke Jeffries: Hi, this is Clarke Jeffries on for Brent. Thanks for taking the question. Firstly, I noticed the reacceleration of payments revenue, up 59% off of the strongest comp last year. Wondering, if we could get an update on the trends in that business, I know, there were some impacts in the e-filing side of the house. But are the payment trends looking like it's steadily improving from here?
Brian Miller: They are. There's some rebound in e-filing, although, it's not dramatic. I think our e-filing revenues were up sort of mid-single-digits. But as courts open back up, we would expect to see volumes pick back up there in that transaction-based business. That does typically have a payments component. But we've talked about our own payment initiatives over the last few quarters and how we are starting to - with a sort of a newly refined go-to-market strategy. We are trying to push our payments platform into more of our customers, so increase the adoption. And we're certainly seeing increased adoption among their citizens in making payments online. We're adding new customers, and we're bringing in more payment types with those customers that do have our payments platform. So we're still in the early stages within the Tyler business of performing against that strategic objective of significantly increasing our payments business. And we really look forward to seeing how we can use the NIC payments platform and their expertise to help accelerate that. But the business on its own is doing well within Tyler, and it's had really strong growth over the last couple of years. But again, still off a much smaller base than NIC has.
Lynn Moore: Yeah, that's right, Brian. As we rollout payments, you're going to see throughout the rest of the year as we get more and more of our solutions online in the payments. We've been doing that work. We started that last year. And as Brian mentioned, really, it's - while it's still small businesses tend to grow fast. And if you look at a 3-year run rate, we're probably at 3 times the revenue as we were 3 years ago. And our Q1 actually out-beat plan, and we were up year-over-year in Q1 in our payments. So that's encouraging to see. And as Brian mentioned, our e-filing revenues are actually getting back closer to pre-pandemic levels. They're getting closer to the 80%, 85%, 90% now levels of pre-pandemic. So that's all very encouraging.
Clarke Jeffries: Great. And then, I would say one thing that - as we break part the NIC business, that stood out is, I think, Lynn, you mentioned this briefly on the 20% revenue growth on state-level contracts, is that same-state IGS growth that averaged around 15% for the last 2 years? I'm just wondering if this is an asset that could potentially accelerate post-pandemic as some of the DHR headwinds abate, and then you just have new opportunities with new states building off of revenue expansion with existing states.
Lynn Moore: Well, I think, that's a good question. I don't know it's - again, it's probably a little early for me to comment on their multiyear growth plans there as we're still doing our integration and getting our arms around 2021. But certainly, their IGS services, their same-state enterprise revenues, those are growing areas for them and those areas that we think we can help complement them and help bring even further growth. So that would be my long-term expectation. I certainly don't have anything more specific in terms of guidance around that right now.
Clarke Jeffries: All right, great, and congratulations on the quarter.
Lynn Moore: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Joe Goodwin with JMP.
Joe Goodwin: Great. Thanks guys for taking the question and good morning. Can you comment on how Socrata performed? And then also, has there been any changes to competitive environment maybe from some other more horizontal vendors with respect to Socrata?
Lynn Moore: Yeah, no, Socrata is performing very well. One of the things that we've really put a focus on really last 18 months or so is more, we call cross-divisional bookings, but we're really pushing Socrata through Tyler's traditional sales channels as opposed to Socrata's traditional sales channels. One of the most exciting opportunities, I think, with NIC as well is the opportunity for Socrata. Socrata had a lot of state and federal customers on their own before they came to Tyler. And with Tyler, we've been focusing on driving that more at the local level. And there's a lot of interest at NIC. I mentioned earlier about our management team's meeting earlier this week. And one of the big topics of conversation was Socrata and the excitement around what they can do and push data insights at all the various state agency levels. And so, I think the outlook there is pretty good. I don't know that I've seen anything specific about a competitor that's anything new or different. Socrata has done a number of things in the pandemic, which has been helpful, but also there's been times we talk about delays. It's also been some issues. Socrata's, I felt the same thing the rest of our business has, and has not grown quite as fast in the last years as we may have anticipated. But the future of Socrata within Tyler and our Connected Communities visions and what we're trying to do, which, again, I don't know that any other company has the ability to do it. It's an important piece of that, and it's something that provides a lot of excitement both within our clients as well as within Tyler. So it's, yeah, it's doing well.
Brian Miller: Yeah, really the ability to use that platform to provide advanced data and analytics capabilities within our existing Tyler core solutions gives us such an advantage over the horizontal competitors that aren't strictly public sector-focused and don't have that deep integration with our core products. So we started with the ERP and the analytics for finance. We've had great success with public safety. It's really created a competitive advantage for us with our New World Public Safety products by adding the Socrata Data and Analytics layers. And now, we're rolling it out with the appraisal and tax, and with the Assessment Connect product that's adding value to our tax. So as Lynn said, really focusing on driving it into our market, both through inside sales and in new sales by adding a Socrata component to new software sales.
Joe Goodwin: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And as we have reached our allotted time for questions, I would like to return the floor to Mr. Moore for any closing comments.
Brian Miller: Before we close, I'd like to add one clarification on an earlier question. There was a question about the $25 million decline in software and services bookings in Q1 compared to Q1 of last year. That's not just services, that's a combination of licenses and services. And most of that is related to licenses. Again, we had some large license deals in Q1 of last year. We saw a lower number of Q1 licenses booked this year in Q1. So the major part of that $25 million decline and probably about $20 million of it is in the license side and about $5 million in services, mostly related to billable travel services.
Lynn Moore: Great. Thanks, Brian, for that clarification. And thanks, everybody, for joining us today. We hope you stay safe and healthy. And if you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Brian Miller and myself. Thanks, everybody.
Operator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-11 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello. And welcome to today’s Tyler Technologies Fourth Quarter 2020 Conference Call. Your host for today’s call is Lynn Moore, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, February 10, 2021.  I’d like to turn the call over to Mr. Moore. Please go ahead.
Lynn Moore: Thank you, Grant, and welcome to our call. With me today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. As you have seen, in addition to our fourth quarter earnings, we made another very significant announcement this morning. So we have a lot to talk about today. I’d like to point out that we posted on our Investor Relations website and filed with our 8-K, a presentation on the acquisition and we will refer to some of those slides later in the call. First, I’d like for Brian to give the safe harbor statement. Next, I will have some preliminary comments on our fourth quarter results and Brian will review the details. After that, we will return to our announcement today of our agreement to acquire NIC Inc. I will have some comments on the proposed acquisition and then we will take questions.
Brian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. During the course of this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information and may include projections concerning the company’s future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause the actual results to differ materially from these projections. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Lynn?
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. Our team executed well in a challenging environment during the fourth quarter and we concluded 2020 with solid earnings and record cash flows. Recurring revenues, which comprise 75% of our fourth quarter revenues were strong, led by a 17% growth in subscription revenues. However, software licenses and services revenues continue to be pressured by longer sales cycles and delays in projects, as clients deal with the effects of the pandemic, along with the near elimination of billable travel. Our revenue mix and cost efficiencies contributed to 120-basis-point expansion of our non-GAAP operating margin to 26.9%. Cash flow has been very robust throughout the year and both cash from operations and free cash flow ended the year strong and grew 16.5% and 25.8%, respectively. This was our highest fourth quarter and full year cash flow ever, and for the year, free cash flow grew 53.6% to $326.6 million. Bookings for the quarter were relatively flat with the prior year at approximately $333 million. Our largest deal of the quarter, which was also the largest single contract in our history, was a five-year extension of our e-filing arrangement with the Texas Office of Court Administration valued at approximately $98 million. The extension also included e-filing insights, a Socrata-based interactive reporting layer that eliminates hundreds of hours of manual reporting activities and gets clerks in all 254 counties, the ability to monitor 50,000 daily filings, so they can identify bottlenecks inefficiencies and improve the experience for the public. However, due to certain contract provisions, only a very small portion of the value of this contract was included in backlog and bookings. If the entire value of this contract had been included in backlogs, bookings growth for the fourth quarter would have been approximately 28%. Our largest new SaaS deal in the fourth quarter was with Jackson County, Missouri, for our iasWorld appraisal and tax solution, as well as Appraisal Services valued at approximately $18 million. Other significant contract signed this quarter included a multi-suite license arrangement for our Munis ERP, EnerGov civic services and Socrata Data Insights solutions, with the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands valued at approximately $5 million. SaaS agreements with the city of Jacksonville, Florida for EnerGov civic services solution and with Stark County, Ohio for our public safety solutions, each valued at approximately $4 million. And 10 SaaS deals and three license contracts for various Tyler solutions, each valued at over $1 million. Brian will discuss our guidance for 2021, but I’d like to update you on some of our plans surrounding our strategic initiatives to accelerate our move to the cloud. Our 2021 plan includes accelerated and new cloud investments across the spectrum of our products. Our plan includes approximately $23 million of investments in cloud product development in 2021 and a total investment of more than $52 million over the next three years, with the majority of that expensed. As a result of these investments, we expect by the end of 2023, all of our major applications lead to be cloud native or cloud efficient for deployment at AWS. We have also made some organizational changes, some of which were announced earlier this week to focus additional leadership on our cloud initiatives, as well as streamlining internal technology and security operations and driving other technology efficiency objectives. Now, I’d like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter.
Brian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. This morning Tyler Technologies reported its results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2020. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We have also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financial Reports tab schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings backlog and recurring revenues. Our revenues continued to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. GAAP revenues for the quarter were $283.3 million, down 1.9%. On a non-GAAP basis, revenues were $283.4 million, down 1.4%. Software license revenues declined 46%, reflecting both extended sales cycles and a very high mix of subscription deals at 73%. Software services revenues declined to 18%, as some projects slowed as a result of COVID-19 and our shift to remote delivery of most services also resulted in a $5 million decline in billable travel revenue. On the positive side, subscription revenues rose 17%. We added 118 new subscription-based arrangements and converted a quarterly high of 50 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $73 million in total contract value. In Q4 of last year we added 164 new subscription-based arrangements and had 18 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $74 million in contract value. Subscription contract value comprised approximately 73% of total new software contract value signed this quarter, compared to 54% in Q4 of last year. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 3.5 years, compared to 4.4 years last year. Revenues from e-filing and online payments, which are included in subscriptions were $24.6 million, up 13.3%. That amount includes e-filing revenue of $15.5 million, up 5.1% and e-payments revenue of $9.1 million, up 30.6%. For the fourth quarter, our annualized non-GAAP total recurring revenue or ARR was approximately $850 million, up 10.4%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS arrangements for Q4 was approximately $278 million, up 17.9%. Transaction-based ARR was approximately $98 million, up 13.3% and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was approximately $474 million, up 5.8%. Our backlog at the end of the quarter reached a new high of $1.59 billion, up 9.4%. As Lynn noted, our bookings in the quarter were relatively flat at $333 million. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1.3 billion, down 1.3%, against a tough comparison that included the two large North Carolina Courts deals totaling approximately $105 million in the prior trailing 12 months. If the full amount of the Texas e-filing extension had been included in our backlog, Q4 bookings would have grown 28% and trailing 12 month bookings would have grown 5.8%. Our software subscription bookings in the fourth quarter added $11 million in new annual recurring revenue. The bookings growth rate was also affected by the shorter average term for new subscription contracts. As it was throughout the year, cash flow was robust in the fourth quarter as cash from operations increased 16.5% to $88.8 million and free cash flow grew 25.8% to $83.7 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $758 million in cash and investments, and no outstanding debt. Our earnings release has the full details of our 2021 guidance, which excludes the impact of NIC and any other acquisitions, which may be completed during the year. We expect to update our guidance to include the NIC transaction after it closes. With regard to revenue and earnings, we expect 2021 GAAP and non-GAAP revenues will both be between $1.190 billion and $1.220 billion, representing a range of growth from 6.6% to 9.3%. We expect 2021 GAAP diluted EPS will be between $4.03 and $4.21, and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on our GAAP effective tax rate. We expect 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $5.65 and $5.77, representing an increase of 2.4% to 4.5%. Fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between 42.5 million and 43 million shares. As we look ahead to 2021, it’s clear that we won’t be back to normal for some time. We have said on prior calls that we anticipate that the impact of COVID-19 would continue into 2021 and our plan for this year anticipate this ongoing uncertainty. Nonetheless, we are excited about our opportunities to accelerate revenue growth and achieve our margin objectives for this year. Revenue growth while below our normal targets is expected to be significantly above the 2020 level. Just to refresh your memory, as we entered 2020, our guidance was for non-GAAP revenue growth of approximately 10% to 12% and for margins to be relatively flat with 2019 with an expectation of resuming our margin expansion trajectory in 2020. COVID-19 obviously resulted in the 2020 performance that was very different from our initial guidance, as we finished with low-single digit revenue growth and 150 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin expansion. We have talked before about how some of the factors that led to margin improvement in 2020 are sustainable while others are not. Those factors include a favorable change in our revenue mix from a decline in low margin revenues like professional services and billable travel, as well as cost savings in areas like travel, marketing and employee healthcare. I’d like to point out a few of the factors that are expected to impact our margins this year. Employee healthcare expense will have a significant impact on operating margins in 2021. During 2020, we saw an unexpected decline in our healthcare costs as the pandemic curtailed elective surgeries, checkups and much of our employees’ non-urgent healthcare and our net health claims expense per employee declined 8.4% for the year. As those costs returned to normal pre-pandemic levels in 2021 coupled with inflation, we are expecting an increase of approximately $13 million or 21% over the reduced level in 2020. Also our diluted share count is expected to be 575,000 to 1.1 million shares higher than in 2020. We issued approximately 1.3 million shares under our stock compensation plans in 2020, including 1.2 million shares from the exercise of stock options granted in previous years. Our higher stock price also impacts the dilution calculation.  If our diluted share count in 2021 was the same as 2020, our non-GAAP EPS guidance would be about $0.18 higher. As a reminder, beginning in 2018, we began a shift in our long-term incentive equity to a mix of options restricted stock units and performance stock units. As that shift continues, we anticipate a significantly less dilutive impact of long-term stock incentives going forward. Our guidance implies operating margins that are modestly below the 2020 level, but above our 2019 operating margins. That trend is generally in line with the trajectory we targeted at the beginning of 2020 and if we achieve our plan, we will finish 2021 with margins in line with or above what we would have expected pre-pandemic. So, to conclude, our 2021 plan reflects a solid combination of organic revenue growth and strategic growth investments, especially around our cloud transition. Now, I’d like to turn the call back over to Lynn.
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. As I look back on 2020, I marvel in how our team of professionals performed in the extraordinary environment of the last few months. We were laser focused on continuing to take care of our clients’ needs as we always do, while taking care of each other at the same time and while our financial results certainly weren’t what we expected at the start of the year, we adapted to the new realities of the pandemic with very good results. As I have said numerous times during last year, I couldn’t be prouder to lead our incredible company and its people. While 2020 presented a myriad of challenges, we view many of those challenges as creating opportunities that Tyler is well positioned to take advantage of. Our financial position is stronger than it was a year ago with more than $800 million in cash and investments and no debt on our balance sheet today. We have been able to continue to invest in and in some cases accelerate all of our long-term strategic initiatives and they are all on track. As a result, our competitive position has also continued to strengthen. We believe the pandemic will further accelerate the public sectors move to the cloud and we are in great position to support that move. Our client base is large and diverse, with more than 27,000 implementations and it represents our greatest asset for both future sales opportunities and the dependable revenue stream it produces, and we have a deep and experienced management team that has weathered difficult economic times in the past. All of these factors make us confident that we are exceptionally well-positioned to capitalize as markets return to normal. With that, I’d like to turn to this morning’s extremely exciting announcement that Tyler has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire NIC Inc. in all-cash transaction for a purchase price of approximately $2.3 billion. We are going to spend a bit of time today walking you through why NIC is an exceptional addition to Tyler family and we will leave time at the end of the presentation for your questions. But before we begin, I will remind you that we have posted a presentation on the acquisition on our IR website and I will refer to some of the slides in my remarks. I would draw your attention to the disclosures on slide three related to solicitation materials and remind you that additional information is available on the websites of both Tyler and NIC. So, with that out of the way, I’d like to start by highlighting the significant benefits of this acquisition, the largest in Tyler’s history by a wide margin brings to our business. NIC is a leading digital solutions provider to state and federal government entities and will meaningfully increased Tyler’s presence in both of those sectors, building on the entry points we achieved via acquisitions of MicroPact and Socrata a couple of years ago. NIC also brings to Tyler a very large incremental payments processing business for governments, allowing us to meaningfully grow our revenue stream that is highly recurring in nature. NIC’s unique state-wide contract structure and complementary portfolio of offerings will allow Tyler to better serve a broader customer base with a more complete set of solutions. And perhaps most importantly, Tyler and NIC are two companies whose cultures are complementary and well-aligned, which I will touch on more in a moment. In terms of the transaction specifics, this is an all-cash transaction for a purchase price of $34 per share, which equates to an equity value of $2.3 billion or an enterprise value of approximately $2.1 billion, inclusive of NIC balance sheet cash. We have committed financing to fund the transaction in the form of cash on hand and a $1.6 billion bridge facility, which we anticipate replacing with permanent capital between signing and closing. The transaction has been unanimously approved by both Boards of Directors and is expected to close in the second quarter, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and approval by the NIC shareholders. We expect this combination to be accretive to our non-GAAP earnings and EBITDA, as well as to our recurring revenue mix and free cash flow per share in the first year. It’s important to note that we will continue to maintain a strong balance sheet post transaction with a very reasonable balance of leverage and liquidity. I’d like to briefly touch again on the point around culture and how that played into the rationale for this acquisition. NIC is a company that’s been on Tyler’s radar screen for quite some time and we have admired their reputation in the marketplace from a distance. As I and the rest of the Tyler management team got to know our counterpart NIC over the last few weeks and months, it became increasingly clear how similar our two organizations are, as you can see from the similarities in our respective missions. Tyler and NIC are two companies built on integrity and focused on delivering differentiated value for all of our respective constituents, governments, businesses, citizens, employees and shareholders. I view this combination as a continued realization of our mission of empowering the public sector to create smarter, safer and stronger communities. The pandemic has accelerated the shift by governments to online services and electronic payments as more citizens and businesses are interacting digitally with government. NIC is uniquely positioned with a deep expertise and robust digital solutions to partner with us in making government more efficient and more accessible to citizens. NIC’s capabilities and vision align with are complementary to our connected communities vision and will advance our efforts to bring that to our clients. On slide six, we have included a bit more information on NIC, as well as some key relevant statistics. The company is a leading digital solutions and payments provider serving more than 7,100 federal, state and local government agencies across the nation. NIC has enterprise-wide partnerships with 31 states and a robust payments business that currently processes $24 billion in payments annually and that amount will increase significantly with implementation of the payments processing contract NIC recently signed with the State of Florida. The company’s broad set of solutions and a unique go-to-market contracting model allow NIC to become deeply embedded with their clients, resulting in predictable, highly recurring revenue growth. For the fiscal year ended 2020, NIC delivered revenue of more than $460.5 million and adjusted EBITDA of about $108.8 million. NIC’s complete fourth quarter earnings were also released this morning and you will find their complete results on their website. On slide seven, you can see the breadth of NIC’s leading portfolio of digital government solutions. At a high level, the company is focused on delivering user-friendly digital services that make it easier and more efficient to interact with government, providing valuable conveniences like applying for unemployment insurance, submitting business filings, renewing licenses, accessing information and making secure payments without visiting a government office. NIC serves both businesses and citizens with solutions to tackle information, interactions and payments for a wide range of government agencies, and importantly, including a variety of delivery methods such as Gov2Go. NIC’s unique proprietary cross agency mobile platform designed specifically for citizens to interact with governments. We drill down a bit further into NIC’s focus areas on slide eight, and importantly, how NIC’s solutions map to our existing portfolio. As we assessed NIC’s fit with Tyler, we thought about their portfolio of offerings through a number of lenses. Certain of NIC’s end markets such as their solutions for businesses, courts and healthcare are highly complementary with Tyler’s. NIC’s presence in these sectors at the state and federal level are naturally aligned with Tyler’s established presence at the local level. Other areas such as outdoor recreation and taxes represent natural adjacencies to expand Tyler’s current business, while a sector like motor vehicles is a clear growth opportunity. The key takeaway from our assessment of NIC’s portfolio is that there are a number of areas where Tyler’s existing businesses will benefit from NIC quickly and were avenues of growth should open up organically for both of us over time. A similar fact pattern emerges, if you look at NIC’s geographic footprint, which is shown on slide nine. NIC has established relationships across the nation including geographic alignment with Tyler in several complementary solution areas with 16 states where both companies have active contracts at different agencies. NIC’s State Enterprise and Platform Solutions businesses, both of which we will touch on in greater detail in a moment, already have great breadth and depth, and we see a number of white space opportunities to expand these platforms as part of the Tyler portfolio. We also view NIC’s federal client relationships as a natural fit to meaningfully expand our existing Tyler Federal business. On slide 10 we provide a more detailed overview of NIC’s State Enterprise business, including a look at the long-term relationships the company has built over time. NIC’s State Enterprise Solution offers a unique approach to working with governments by putting dedicated local teams in capital cities for support and developing services and solutions that are relevant to all agencies within a state government. NIC is able to deploy best practices gleaned over a number of decades and leverage a deep foundation of technological capabilities in tailoring solutions to fit specialized needs. The company’s flexible state-wide contract vehicles allow governments to avoid cumbersome procurement processes by authorizing NIC to develop and implement a wide range of solutions across a number of different agencies. These long-term contracts lead to clear line of sight both operationally and from a revenue perspective, as evidenced by NIC’s historic ability to grow same state revenue at 8% plus. NIC’s Platform Solutions business, which is illustrated on slide 11 includes comprehensive agency-specific vertical solutions that are the product of significant investments NIC has made in recent years, both organically and inorganically and represent scalable solutions designed to address specific areas of market demand. On the payment side, NIC has built a comprehensive platform specifically designed for governments that can be integrated into state enterprise systems or offered standalone. Recently acquired solutions in licensing and healthcare are already showing early wins with new contracts awards across five states while NIC has successfully deployed various outdoor recreation solutions in 12 states. The early momentum in this piece of NIC’s business is clearly evident and is very exciting for Tyler. We see significant opportunity to drive outsized growth with these platform technologies. Turning to slide 12, I would like to reiterate how strongly we believe in the merits of this transaction and view the addition of NIC as a combination of complementary strengths. With this acquisition we will create a public sector technology solutions leader that furthers our goal of connecting governments with constituents and businesses in a way that is seamless and transparent. I’d close by noting how delighted we are to soon welcome NIC and their employees to the Tyler family. I remind you that we expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of this year and is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory reviews and approval by NIC stockholders. As a result, we are somewhat limited in our ability to discuss certain aspects of the transaction at this time. With that, we’d like to open up the line for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Kirk Materne: Okay. Thanks very much and congratulations on the acquisition. Lynn, two questions I think for you predominantly. Just first on the, I guess, the backdrop right now in the Tyler business, are you hearing any sort of, I guess, green shoots coming from some of your clients yet in terms of their budgets. I guess these activity levels around the top end of the funnel. Just trying to get a sense on whether you see you guys -- if you see any sort of defrosting in the market a little bit? You said it’s a nice deal this quarter but clearly it’s still challenging. So how do you see that maybe playing out over ‘21? And then just on the NIC deal, clearly, seems like you are going to leave the business alone for at least the near-term. Can you just talk about some of the synergies maybe you see from a topline perspective at least as you look out over the next one year or two years maybe the one or two things that you think are maybe lower hanging fruit on that front? Thanks.
Lynn Moore: Yeah. Thanks, Kirk. On your first question around budgets and activity level, as we said going -- we said at the last quarterly call, our anticipation was that COVID would continue into 2021. As you recall, most of our clients, their budget seasons are June 30, so they are in the midst of those budgets. When you look back at 2020 and some of the comments I made during the year, the pandemic actually it was impacting different parts of our business a little bit differently. We saw a little more impact in our ERP space, particularly at the mid and higher end, and a little bit more in the appraisal and tax base. We actually had a really good sales year last year at courts and justice when they talk about that a little bit later was actually a record sales year for them. But the number of RFPs and demos and all that slowed down really impacted certain parts of our business more. And it’s just anecdotal right now. We are now just one month into 2021, but in -- what we have seen a little bit, particularly on the ERP side, we don’t talk about awards and wins, but the awards in January and the contract values was something that’s certainly up over the last eight months and is a positive sign. We see things over and like in the appraisal and tax area where there are some fairly significant projects, some fairly large RFPs that really got put on the shelf in Q2 of last year. We are starting to see those starting to come out again, that doesn’t necessarily mean mini contracts, as you know, or immediate deals, but we are seeing some of that. There is still going to be headwinds in 2021, obviously, with the COVID relief that just passed, there is some uncertainty about what that’s going to mean. We are still seeing pushes and delays. But I think at your comment about defrosting, I kind of getting an early sense, but again it’s anecdotal right now. I think we will know a lot more obviously at the end of Q1 and as the vaccine rolls out and people start getting more comfortable, I think, we will start getting better clear site on that. On the NIC front, I just want to say a couple of things, I have mentioned in the opening remarks, a couple of times now about stockholder approval and regulatory approval. There are certain things I can say right now and certain things I can’t. I am going to air right now on the conservative side, because this is a big deal and I am so excited, and the last thing I want to do is overstep my bounds on this call with my excitement and do something to potentially jeopardize this transaction. I can tell you that we see a lot of revenue opportunities, lot of revenue opportunities for NIC and lot of revenue opportunities for Tyler. It’s going to take some time just like all of our acquisitions. As you know you followed us a long time where we are a good acquirer, we bring companies in, we take our time. Our first model is make sure we don’t break the great company that they have built. We are going to sit down with them and really map out sort of what those opportunities are and what’s the best timeline to achieve them, while also keeping their strong business intact. I can just tell you that when we look at those and we look at how are the complementary nature of our businesses and the ability to utilize some of their state-wide contracts and what they are doing in payments and what we can learn from them and what they might can learn from us. It’s pretty exciting. And I think, I really look forward to sharing a lot more detail as it goes on. But I am going to try to keep my comments at pretty high level at this point.
Kirk Materne: Got it. Thanks, Lynn.
Lynn Moore: Sure.
Operator: Our next question will come from Keith Housum. He is with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.
Keith Housum: Yeah. Lynn congratulations on the acquisition. As you guys know I cover NIC and they are a quality company with some really good people there. So great job there. Just I completely respect the limits that you have on in terms of talking about the deal. But just to be clear though, you guys see this clear -- clearly from a revenue synergy standpoint as opposed to any type of significant cost cutting synergies, correct?
Lynn Moore: Yeah. That’s absolutely correct, Keith. And I think that’s our history at Tyler is. We -- when we pursue an acquisition for strategic purposes and it’s not to go in quote create synergies through cost, it’s about how we are going to invest and grow that business and align it with ours. You have seen that throughout other Tyler acquisitions and it’s one of the things I am most proud of. And in fact I mentioned in Kirk’s response how C&J last year really had a record year in sales and a lot of that has to do with the fact of the acquisitions we have done over the years and how we have integrated them and opened up new markets and aligned them with our business and that’s exactly what we see with the NIC acquisition. It’s a great company, as you mentioned. It’s the company built on integrity. They have got a great management team, really strong management team as you would expect and we are just really excited about bringing them into the Tyler fold and getting to work together.
Keith Housum: Great. Thanks. Maybe if I just turn it over to Tyler business in the fourth quarter, so clearly software licenses, I guess, no real surprise there, some delays are still continuing. Is there a point in 2021 or maybe even 2022 that we are actually going to see the release of some pent-up demand or is it the ability by the clients that sweat their assets where they probably won’t it would be more blood in. How can we kind of think about a recovery from COVID? I hope that as a return to a more normalized world toward the end of the year?
Lynn Moore: Yeah. I think, obviously, it’s a little hard to nail down. As we said before on calls the demand didn’t go away. I mean, everything we do is we provide a central functionality essential services, it’s there. And what we have seen for example and what I have talked about in the past, I have mentioned that last year, maybe a little bit more difficult year on sales in our mid to upper level ERP space. That’s really just a more reflection of people being able to hang on with their systems for another year and sort of sweat it out and it’s my expectation that that pent-up demand will be released. It’s hard to predict exactly when. And again, what we have talked about over the last year is, we really lean back on our experience back during the great recession. Well, it’s not -- it’s really not apples to apples, there is a lot of similarities and what we saw there was sort of a depressed market for a couple of years, but then that market open up. And it’s sort of exploded and the fact that we were able to invest and improve our competitive position really put us in a great position to capitalize on that and that’s the way we feel about it now. We are just as optimistic about the future as I was coming into 2020.
Keith Housum: Great. Thanks. Appreciate it. Good luck.
Lynn Moore: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question will come from Peter Heckmann. He is with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.
Peter Heckmann: Hey. Good morning, gentlemen, and let me echo those congratulations. I have covered you guys since 2005 and I agree there is a very nice complementary fit here both culturally and from a business perspective and so I think it’s going to going to be a nice deal. I know you don’t want to talk too much about the details, but could you let us know, is there a go shop provision with the deal any type of termination fees involved? And then just back of the envelope, it looks like the deal might get you to around 2.5 times levered post-deal. Is that about the right ballpark?
Lynn Moore: Yeah. Pete, and again, thanks for the comments on NIC. We couldn’t agree more on the cultural fit and I want to spend a second on that before I get to your other questions is, we have done a lot of acquisitions over the years and the one thing that we have learned and one thing we primarily look for is cultural alignment. Because in our experience acquisitions can -- they can look great on paper and they can look great in banker books and all that stuff that you see. But really it doesn’t matter if the cultures are aligned, it just doesn’t matter how good it looks on paper, they just ultimately won’t work out and that’s one of the things that’s so exciting about this. And as I have spent time with Harry, their CEO, and as we got to know their management team, just seeing their culture and seeing the way they approach the business and how it aligned with us and their vision. That’s just a very key point. As it relates to the agreement itself, I believe the agreement got filed or will be filed today. So as you talk about no shop provisions and termination fees, those are all fairly standard negotiated provisions that you will see in these sorts of public company deals. I would say, the terms of those in this agreement are somewhat typical. I will let you go look those up in the side on those. But, yeah, they are fairly typical and things that you would expect to see in a stock transaction. On the financing front, I am glad you raised that. We have talked about forever our strong balance sheet and you are right. When you look at a net debt to EBITDA ratio, we believe it’s going to be pretty manageable, maybe somewhere in the 3 times, the high 2s, low 3s, but somewhere around there will be pretty reasonable. The one thing I want to specifically emphasize as well, this is significant amount of debt and it’s something that we haven’t carried for a long time. It’s my goal and my anticipation as we move to more committed financing that we are going to maintain a lot of flexibility and we are going to -- our balance sheet is still going to look very strong. It’s one of the things I am committed to doing and putting this permanent financing together. I spoke to our Board about it two days ago. It’s really important that how we structure this debt allows us to continue to do the things that we have done so successfully for so many years and have been a big part of our success. Things like the flexibility to continue and invest in all of our R&D initiatives that continue to do acquisitions as they arise and opportunistic share repurchases. It’s my anticipation that we will still have that flexibility over the next several years as we work with the debt and I believe to be very manageable. So I appreciate that question.
Peter Heckmann: Great. Great. That’s fair. And then just as a quick follow-up, in terms of the main buckets of government federal, state, your city and -- cities and towns, are you seeing one of those that, I would assume federal has maybe some less significant budget restrictions at this point. And so are you seeing a little bit better activity there like for a MicroPact or a Socrata then you would maybe at this level, just given the need for balanced budgets at the state level?
Lynn Moore: Yeah. So it’s interesting, I’d actually -- throughout 2020 that was really more the case. There was probably a little more pressure on the state budgets than there was at the federal level and we saw that with our MicroPact and Socrata solutions. As we got into the fourth quarter and as actually state budgets have started to stabilize, we are actually starting to see the shift right now. And as we look into 2021, we see the state budgets actually starting to come back and opportunity starting to open up. And actually right now, at the federal level, it’s a little bit more cautious, I wouldn’t -- cautious maybe the wrong word, but it’s really has more to do with the change in administration. And so there will probably be a little bit of a pause there on deals. We saw there were some deals in Q4 once the election happened and you get a change in administration, you get change in organization, leadership and priorities. There is just a little bit of a pause. But I would expect as the year continues to roll out and particularly with some of the initiatives that we are seeing come out at a Congress that’s going to pick back up as the year goes on.
Peter Heckmann: Great. I appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Berg with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.
Scott Berg: Hi, Lynn and Brian. Congrats on the acquisition and thanks for taking my questions. I guess, kind of two here, Lynn, starting with the acquisition is, I haven’t covered NIC, obviously, looked at them from a far and this probably ends a 10-year rumor that you guys might ultimately quite hear them. But on their business at least from how I understand it a little bit, correct me if I am wrong. But some of their state and federal opportunities have a little bit more of a custom software kind of component to it, the pure pre-packaged software, which is predominantly what Tyler sells today. How do you deal with that going forward or is that kind of maybe a miss -- misconception in terms of what their products may look like to those larger customers?
Lynn Moore: I’d say, Scott, and I think, that was probably more their business model when they started. It’s obviously there is still a part of that I think what they have been doing is they have been evolving their business to make it less custom and to make it more leverageable across their client base. You are also seeing what they have done the last several years where they have started to get some more vertical solutions. They have done a couple of small acquisition and starting to push those. I mean, I think, part of their overall growth plan absent Tyler, was to sort of continue to move in that direction and that’s the direction they are moving on and we would expect that to continue.
Scott Berg: Got it. Helpful. And then, I guess, congratulations to Jeff for leading the new accelerated move to your cloud platform. But I guess, as we think about that movements at the end of 2023 is only roughly a three years weight to have all your apps to be cloud native or I guess cloud efficient is just kind of a two-part question there is. First, how do we think about margin structure and what the new platform looks like, now that you are getting more visibility around kind of time frames, etc., gross margin structure obviously on those customers? And then two, how do you migrate those customers. Is this something that you try to push relatively quickly to get some of your current subscription based customers to move over that or do you allow them to kind of naturally migrate there over a longer timeframe? Thanks.
Lynn Moore: Yeah. Thanks, Scott. I think, it’s going to be a mix of a little bit of both and part of it is, as we think about going through a cloud transformation -- really the cloud transformation at Tyler. And as you know, that’s more than just getting your products into a certain state. It eventually really impacts the way not just how you develop products but how you deploy and support them. Part of that strategy, as you mentioned is, migrating our customers out of the Tyler systems and moving them over to AWS. The principal foundational piece of that though is, is making sure that our products as we move them over there that they operate in at least an efficient if not more efficient way than they are in the current Tyler cloud centers and that’s what we are operating on now. I think you will see over and we talk about over the next three years, that doesn’t mean all of them are all going to suddenly be magically there at December 31, 2023. It will be getting there in different stages along the way, some sooner than others. And I think as we go forward and we think about those plans, you will start to see us develop plans where perhaps new customers are all going into the AWS world. You will see certain areas where our products already are more cloud efficient or closer that we will become more aggressive with our existing customers and so it’s going to be a little bit of blend and a mix. And that’s also part of why we created this group. I mean, this group was created for a number of reasons. It’s very exciting. Jeff, as you mentioned he’s been here almost 30 years, he knows our business inside now. He is the perfect guy to oversee and coordinate and that’s really part of what this role is. It’s a Tyler-wide, company-wide coordination of all of these multiple streams that you are talking about. It’s not just getting our products there. It’s getting our plans on migration. It’s getting plans on getting out to Tyler datacenters. It’s improving our IT infrastructure and making information security standard discipline. It’s all the things it starting to build. How we are going to deploy and support and all of that and so it’s a comprehensive effort. And you will -- we will continue to talk more about it each quarter, each -- every three months, six months, and we will talk about the progress and as these plans evolve and they get a little more specific. But at a high level that’s where it is. And Brian, we have talked before on the margins as we move people into the cloud world. We expect significant margin improvement and significant revenue improvement both getting them on the subscription. But then also getting our products more cloud efficient will help margins getting to where we have fewer releases and they are deployed easier, it will help margins. Everything that’s all about the cloud transformation and that’s all going to help over the coming years.
Scott Berg: Great. Congrats again. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Charlie Strauzer with CJS Securities. Please go ahead.
Charlie Strauzer: Hi. Good morning. Couple of quick questions for you. Lynn, you were talking about the balance sheet structure post the transaction and the type of debt you wanted to take on. Are you thinking more in terms of like a term loan or credit facility where you could use your strong free cash flow to quickly pay down the debt?
Brian Miller: Hi, Charlie. This is Brian. We are actually considering a number of alternatives there. So we are not ready to quite specify one. But it’s clear that the way interest rates are, the way some of the specific debt markets are, it’s a very, very attractive time for a company with our profile with the transaction as financially compelling as this one to be looking to raise their debt. And so, we have got a lot of options, as Lynn said, maintaining flexibility and not limiting our ability to execute on other initiatives is key in that decision. But you will see more about that in the next few weeks from us.
Charlie Strauzer: Excellent. Thanks. And then just looking at NIC’s performance in 2020, you clearly had some benefits from some new programs they have rolled out for COVID-related things. What -- how should we think about kind of the longer term growth aspects for the topline of that business? Clearly, there is kind of more low-single digits prior to 2020. But help us think about how we should think about that business going forward?
Lynn Moore: Yeah. Charlie, I’d say two things. You are right. They definitely get a boost in 2020 on some specific COVID pandemic-related products and some initiatives around there. What I’d say to that is, that really shows their innovation and ingenuity and it shows their ability to spin up something quickly to meet the needs and to roll it out really quickly. And in my -- the way I view it is, while that was -- it’s something that was really tied to the pandemic, that’s something that is exciting to see that they can execute on that and to think that we can do things like that in other areas, particularly as we combine with some of the Tyler products. As you look at their overall revenue growth moving forward. I would say, my expectation is it would be more in line with Tyler’s and when you look over the last couple of years. You -- if you look at it sort of in isolation on our 10-K or something, it may look like their overall revenue growth may have been lower. Part of that was the fact that there was a significant contract that they inherited, it wasn’t when they originally sold with the State of Texas and when they lost that that was a significant headwind to year-over-year revenue growth. They have got a number of initiatives inside their business that will be growing at accelerated rates, just like we do at Tyler, some of these specific solution initiatives. I think you are going to see significant growth in their payments business. They -- as I mentioned on my opening remarks, they have recently won the contract with the State of Florida to not only provide state-wide payments across the State, but also it provides opportunities under that contract to do payments at the local level. So that’s kind of at a high level the way I see it right now.
Brian Miller: And I’d also add that over the last decade their same-state revenue growth has been more than 8%, so over a long period of time. That’s been reasonably close to sort of what our organic growth rate has been. So they do have really solid foundation of consistent growth and more than 90% recurring revenues. So that will actually raise our mix in terms of recurring revenues on a combined basis.
Charlie Strauzer: Great. Thank you very much. Congratulations.
Operator: Our next question will come from Matt Vanvliet with BTIG. Please go ahead.
Matt Vanvliet: Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions guys and congrats on the announcement. I guess, on the core business and maybe also how it relates to the acquisition. Curious on how much success in some of these larger deals especially the State of Texas extension. You feel like the Socrata data layer is enabling especially as everything kind of moves more digitally. I guess, how much are those conversations happening on a deal by deal basis? And then looking at NIC, how quickly do you think you can sort of integrate that and start pushing especially at the state layer where maybe greater visibility is even more paramount?
Lynn Moore: Yeah. Thanks, Matt. On your first comment, you are right. Obviously, we -- the State of Texas contract was an extension of our previous relationship. We have done a lot of things there with the state to build in a lot of value to help our ability to recapture that contract and there is other upsides that come with that contract. One of the things that I have talked about over the last couple of quarters and it certainly haven’t heard, yeah, Socrata plays a role. It’s another value add that we do. But we all sort of seeing Socrata play a role in areas all across our company. And when we purchased Socrata, I guess, that was back in 2018, one of the things that we really liked about it is, not only do we believe that the future public sector is it will be have a focus around data and insights, but how it can really differentiate our products going forward. And I have talked about in public safety deals, we are starting to talk about it in our ERP deals. It’s making a big difference. It’s hard to quantify. But when we have that kind of functionality and that kind of insights and our competitors don’t, it’s just -- it’s a huge add and it’s something that’s a big differentiator. As it relates to quote integration of NIC, again, we are still vary in the early stages of that and we still have a lot of conversations to have with their management team. This deal, while it’s been sort of going on in the back works for, I think, I first reached out to Harry back in September and -- but things have been accelerating and we have talked a lot about the opportunities. But we have got a lot of work to do to get our teams, their teams together and start thinking about those things. Some of those are still going to be a little bit limited again because of regulatory restraints. But all I can tell you and continue to emphasize is, how excited I am, how excited our team is and I believe how excited their team is for the opportunities that we have that we can go out there and do together when we combine these two leadership roles.
Matt Vanvliet: Great. And on the transaction side, continuing to see strong growth there, I’d say, I imagine that’s a fairly high demand factor for a lot of local governments now. But from a competitive front, are you seeing maybe non-traditional vendors in terms of this area of the market enter in as a lot more kind of digital payments or FinTech type companies are looking to reach further into other areas of the market. So curious what you are seeing from the trends there and maybe how much that influenced the exact timing of getting this transaction done?
Lynn Moore: So, I would say that, there is a little bit of that. I think what we always want to differentiate even with this transaction base, just like I talked about in our core applications we differentiate with data and insights is the ability not just to do quote payment processing, but to be able to link those services with other offerings and things we do another and value adds. So that we really become more intertwined and tied with these government agencies. I mean, when -- you are right, when I look out to the future and I look to the future of the public sector market. I see the things like cloud and the provision of subscription-based essential functionality. It’s digital services. It’s transaction-based revenues. It’s data and insights. It’s our Connected Communities vision and it’s bringing all of that stuff together in a way that really nobody else can. And so, yeah, to your question, there is a little bit of that, but we want to make sure that we get in there and add all these extra values and services to our clients that nobody else can deliver.
Matt Vanvliet: Great. Thank you. Congrats.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Ho: Good morning. I just wanted to maybe start out with, understanding, I guess, why is now sort of the right time for the EGOV acquisition given that you have known them for a little bit of time and how does that sort of, I guess, mesh with your M&A strategy like do we sort of see a slowdown in activity. I think you said you wanted to maintain flexibility, but when we think about digestion of something this large, how should we be sort of probably think about that?
Lynn Moore: It’s a good question, Jonathan. And it’s funny, as you know, I have been with Tyler since 1998, EGOV or NIC went public a year later. Obviously, they have been in business for several years before that and literally, they have been on our radar since the day when they went public. We have had internal conversations about them over the years. I would say that part of it is we have been so focused on our mission of getting really all the essential functional areas across local government. As I have said before, we talked about this, we did the MicroPact acquisition even Socrata, its areas that we have always been interested in, but we just haven’t gotten there. I can’t tell you why I didn’t specifically pick up the phone and call Harry three years ago as opposed to this fall. But I can tell you that we spent a lot of time and a lot of work on it even before I made that call. And again we have had conversations for a long time and their business has grown and matured, our business has grown and matured and as we have grown and gotten more solutions and more opportunities and as they have grown and increased their footprint, we really see the balance. And when you look at things like the prior question on payments, this is a big strategic driver for us and it’s a big strategic driver for them and they have got a very significant payments business, we have got an emerging payments business and we see the opportunities there. So it’s just one of those things. But all I can say is we are very excited that we have made this deal that we have made today now. As you talk about our M&A strategy going forward, I would be surprised if this is the only acquisition we do this year. But this is also a big acquisition. It’s going to require a lot of focus on our management teams and this is something we need to get right. And so I could see at some point particularly after this deal closes as we go into the second half of the year that sort of like we were back in 2019 where we may take a little bit of deliberate pause. But as I mentioned, we are going to have the financial wherewithal to continue to capitalize on acquisition opportunities and we are going to continue to look like we always have and I continue -- I expect that will continue to be part of our roadmap going forward, as we continue to see strategic products are ways to increase our TAM or expand our offerings in areas where we already have a large footprint. So our overall strategy won’t change at all. Again, it will probably as we get to the second of the year, a little bit more like 2019.
Jonathan Ho: Got it. And just as a quick follow-up, you talked about your competitive position strengthening throughout the downturn. Can you give us some concrete examples or some, I guess, greater detail in terms of what you are seeing in the competitive landscape and maybe where you are seeing some folks drop off?
Lynn Moore: Yeah. So, I’d say, first of all, just initially it goes back to all of our investments and continue to invest in those. And what we have seen in the market is that some of our competitors are not making the investments that they may have historically done and we have seen a little bit of that. But when we see things like in our Incode Group, which is really the lower end of ERP it’s where our schools is, it’s where utility billing and things like that. That group right now are seeing record win rates. I mean, their win rates are approaching 90%, which is just off the chart and so we get really excited about when we think about the market returning. When we see things like I mentioned earlier on the call, our Courts & Justice Group. 2020 was actually the highest sales year for our Courts & Justice Division. Now, they are POC accounting, so it’s not all going to flow in right away. But you remember back in 2014, 2015 when that group had really high sales which is when California opened up. That’s a process of, I mean, not only our Odyssey continues to be strong, but all the investments we have made around there and the expanded products including acquisitions which was your question earlier and being able to sell all those products and have more functionality and be more competitive. We talk about the public safety. Public safety had another 1 million plus license deal this quarter. They are just on a roll. They had a very big win in Genesee County, Michigan against Motorola and CentralSquare. And again, that’s a result of our competitiveness, our ability to check more boxes on the RFPs, our ability to go up market. And again all these acquisitions that are differentiating these offerings, so those are few examples and we just like where we sit right now and we anxiously await for pre-pandemic market.
Jonathan Ho: Congrats on the acquisition. Thank you.
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Jon.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Rob Oliver with Baird. Please go ahead.
Rob Oliver: Great. Thank you. Good morning, guys. Appreciate it. Lynn, I had one for you and then, Brian, a follow up for you. So, Lynn, I guess, a follow up on Scott Berg’s question earlier, just around the details on the SaaS migration. Very helpful color there. I did note in the quarter that conversions were up nicely. So can you talk a little bit about that how you are managing that go-to-market and obviously you guys since your pivot to a subscription-first mindset has really been predominantly landing with subscription, with new business. But it does seem like conversions are starting to kick up nicely there. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that?
Lynn Moore: Yeah. I think part of that conversion is also just the general market and as we said for a couple of years, the market was moving in this direction, certainly, COVID, I think is accelerating that. We are doing some things internally. It is a focus point for us. I think, one of our greatest opportunities is our existing customer base, whether it’s new products that go in there, whether it’s converting them to the SaaS model, continue to push in, inside sales continue to be one of our big growth drivers and so it’s a combination of a lot of things. But you are right, it’s a focus of ours and as we continue to get our products into a more cloud efficient state, it will become even more of a focus and even more pronounced. And it’s going to take some time, I mean, I don’t want to say this is all going to happen in the next few quarters, but it’s going to take some time, but it’s definitely the direction we are moving and it’s a significant opportunity.
Rob Oliver: Okay. Great. That’s helpful. And then, Brian, on the deal that you guys announced this quarter that extension on the Texas Office of Court Admin. Maybe if you could provide some color on what is it within this contract that did not enable you to show that in bookings and backlog and what are the measuring points that we are going to look to see that start to roll into the numbers?
Brian Miller: Yeah. It’s basically a form of a termination for convenience provision that’s in the contract both neither we nor the State of Texas expect those to be exercised. The state has made some very positive comments about the relationship they have had with Texas as we provided e-filing services for the last few years and made enhancements and so we won that renewal in a very competitive process and with some enhancements to it. It also has I believe five one-year extensions on the end of the -- this five one-year opportunities to extend it. But because there are some termination for convenience provisions that we wouldn’t expect to be exercised. From an accounting perspective, they prevent us from being able to put the full amount in backlog like we normally would with a fixed fee e-filing arrangement. So, I think, there is only, less than $5 million of that contract will go into backlog sort of each quarter. So doesn’t affect revenues but it clearly affects the OpEx. We have talked over a long time about the lumpiness of some of the bookings. But this one -- was one that just didn’t quite fit with the accounting provisions. But it’s a great extension, a great testament to the work we have done with Texas over the last few years. It’s clearly our biggest e-filing arrangement and getting that extension is a major win for us.
Rob Oliver: Great. Thanks, Brian. Thanks, Lynn.
Lynn Moore: Thank you.
Operator: At this time, there appear to be no more questions. Mr. Moore, I will turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.
Lynn Moore: Thanks. Thanks everybody for joining us today. We hope you continue to stay safe and healthy, and if you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to me or Brian Miller. Thanks again.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Hello, and welcome to today's Tyler Technologies Third Quarter 2020 Conference Call. Your host for today's call is Lynn Moore, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded as of today, November 5, 2020. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Moore. Please go ahead, sir.
H. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Thank you, Eric, and welcome to our third quarter 2020 earnings call. With me on the call today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like for Brian to give the Safe Harbor statement. Next, I'll have some preliminary comments and Brian will review the details of our third quarter results. Then, I'll have some additional comments and we'll take questions. Brian?
Brian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Thanks, Lynn. During the course of this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information and may include projections concerning the company's future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause the actual results to differ materially from these projections. We'd refer you to our Form K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Lynn?
H. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Thanks, Brian. We were pleased with our third quarter results as we continue to execute at a high level, particularly in light of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. After we experienced our first year-over-year decline in quarterly revenues in almost a decade, we returned to revenue growth this quarter, driven by strength in recurring revenues. We have not experienced any meaningful cancellations, but longer sales cycles and delays in projects as clients deal with the effects of the pandemic, along with the near elimination of billable travel, led to declines in software license, professional services and appraisal service revenues. However, GAAP subscription revenues grew a robust 18.6% and non-GAAP subscription revenues grew 18%. We continued to experience significant savings in operating expenses in the third quarter, in part driven by the successful deployment of more efficient service delivery and operating models. As a result, our operating margins expanded significantly with our non-GAAP operating margin up 300 basis points to 28.6%. And our adjusted EBITDA was a new quarterly record at $89 million. Cash flow has also been very robust throughout the year, and both cash from operations and free cash flow reached new quarterly highs in the third quarter. It was also a strong quarter for bookings, which rose almost 13%. While the number of new deals was down, the average deal size and total new contract value both were up compared to last year. It was a strong quarter for new business for our Justice solutions as we closed some large contracts after extended sales processes. Our largest deal in the quarter was a license arrangement with the Washington State Courts of Limited Jurisdiction, valued at approximately $15 million for our Odyssey Court Case Management and Caseload Pro Probation Solutions, including e-filing. We also signed significant Justice solutions contract with Dallas County, Texas, including a license arrangement for our Odyssey Solution for criminal and justice of the peace courts valued at approximately $8 million and a SaaS arrangement for our Jury Management Solution valued at approximately $1.6 million. Also, for our Odyssey solution, we signed a license arrangement with Saginaw County, Michigan, and notable SaaS deals with the city of Akron, Ohio and the Texas counties of Guadalupe, Leon, Gillespie and Erath (4:31). We also signed the first state-level contract for our Tyler Supervision product, formerly known as Caseload Pro, with the state of Nevada. Our Public Safety division continues to expand its market with the year-to-date average deal size up 92% over last year. This expansion reflects our increasing competitiveness upmarket as well as an increase in the breadth of products in many deals. Our Public Safety division had never signed two contracts with licenses greater than $1 million each in the same quarter until this quarter, when we signed large contracts with Sedgwick County, Kansas and the City of Laredo, Texas. We also signed a multi-suite contract with Ellis County, Kansas for our New World Public Safety, Odyssey Courts, Socrata Data & Insights and Brazos Solutions and contracts with the city of Brownsville, Texas and Des Moines, Iowa for our Public Safety and Socrata Data & Insight Solutions. Our largest SaaS deal in the quarter was a $6 million contract with the city of Tigard, Oregon in the port – excuse me – in the Portland metropolitan area for our Munis ERP and EnerGov Civic Services solutions. We also signed notable SaaS deals for our Munis ERP solution with the city of Fairfield, California; Champaign County, Illinois; the Virginia Railway Express; the city of Thomasville, Georgia, and a license arrangement with the city of Christiansburg, Virginia. Other significant SaaS deals for our EnerGov Civic Services solution were the cities of Palm Beach Gardens, Florida and Yonkers, New York. Finally, it was also a strong quarter for new business in our federal space with several new contracts, most notably with the D.C. Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, The Counter Trade Products and the Fish and Wildlife Service, both departments within the Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services. As we reported in a Form 8-K filed on September 29, we discovered early on September 23 that an unauthorized third-party intruder had disrupted access to some of our internal phone and IT systems. As soon as we discovered this, we shut down points of access to external systems out of an abundance of caution. We immediately activated our internal incident response plan, which included taking impacted systems offline to further contain the spread. We confirmed that the malicious software the intruder use was ransomware. We are following strict protocols laid out by industry standard incident response directives. Because of this, we are being careful not to share certain details around the incident until the investigation is finished. However, there is some information I can share with you today. From the morning of September 23, our incident response efforts have been facilitated by Tyler's internal resources as well as third-party providers. Those third-party providers include FireEye Mandiant, a nationally recognized incident response provider. We also have been actively cooperating with law enforcement. Our initial analysis has continued to prove correct. The impact of the incident was directed at our internal corporate network and phone systems. There has been no evidence of compromise in the separate and segregated environments where we host software for our clients. And to date, there has been no evidence of malicious activity on client self-hosted systems related to this incident. From day one, we have been regularly communicating with our client community and have actively maintained an incident response page on our website. We encourage you to check for updates there as well. In addition to the containment, recovery and remediation efforts we have undertaken, Tyler has also taken steps to supplement the existing multilayered security monitoring, scanning and antivirus protocols already in place. We are committed to completing our full forensics investigation and taking all appropriate actions in response to our findings. The security incident did impact our ability to deliver licenses and services during late September and into October. We currently estimate the impact to revenue was approximately $1.5 million in the third quarter and $2.5 million in the fourth quarter. We maintained cybersecurity insurance coverage in amount that we believe is adequate. I want to reiterate that what I have just shared with you represents the information we can share at this point, given where we're at in the stage of our investigation and the recovery process. We will not be addressing the incident further on today's call, and we will not take questions on the incident itself or our investigation. I would, however, like to express my gratitude to all Tyler employees, who once again displayed the heart of Tyler in their response and handling of the security incident, especially our internal IT teams that worked around the clock with an aggressive and coordinated response to recover and remediate our internal systems. As with our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Tyler demonstrated the resiliency that comes from strong and well-designed business processes and corporate governance practices. Now, I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter.
Brian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Thanks, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2020. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financial Reports tab, schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. Although our revenues continued to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we were pleased to return to positive revenue growth this quarter. GAAP revenues for the quarter were $285.7 million, up 3.8%. On a non-GAAP basis, revenues were $285.9 million, up 3.2%. Organic revenue growth was 3.3% on a GAAP basis and 2.7% on a non-GAAP basis. Our core software license and subscription revenues grew – combined grew – 8.1% on a non-GAAP basis with 7.8% organic growth. Subscription revenues for the quarter increased 18.6%. We added 114 new subscription-based arrangements and converted a quarterly high of 46 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $56 million in total contract value. In Q3 of last year, we added 150 new subscription-based arrangements and had 20 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $47 million in total contract value. Subscription contract value comprised approximately 47% of total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 51% in Q3 of last year. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 4.3 years compared to 2.7 years in Q3 of last year. Revenues from e-filing and online payments, which are included in subscriptions, were $23.2 million, up 9%. That amount includes e-filing revenues of $15.1 million, up 2.5% over last year and e-payments revenues of $8.1 million, up 23.6%. Transaction-based revenues were negatively impacted by reduced operations at some clients as a result of the pandemic. For the third quarter, our annualized non-GAAP total recurring revenue, or ARR, was approximately $830 million, up 11%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS arrangements for Q3 was approximately $265 million, up 21.6%. Transaction-based ARR was approximately $93 million, up 9%, and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was approximately $472 million, up 6.2%. Our backlog at the end of the quarter reached a new high of $1.55 billion, up 9.2%. As Lynn noted, our bookings in the quarter were strong at $292 million, up 12.9%. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1.3 billion, up 5.4% against a tough comparison that includes the two large North Carolina courts deals totaling approximately $105 million in the prior trailing 12 months. Our software subscription bookings in the third quarter added $9.9 million in new annual recurring revenue. Cash flow from operations increased 30.5% to $169. 8 million and free cash flow grew 34.8% to $165.4 million, both new quarterly highs. In fact, year-to-date, our free cash flow has already surpassed our best full year free cash flow by more than 9%. We ended the quarter with approximately $650 million in cash and investments and no outstanding debt. Our guidance for the full year of 2020 is as follows. We expect 2020 GAAP revenues will be between $1.117 billion and $1.129 billion, and non-GAAP revenues will be between $1.118 billion and $1.130 billion. We expect 2020 GAAP diluted EPS will be between $4.53 and $4.63 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect 2020 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $5.48 and $5.58. For the year, estimated pre-tax non-cash share-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $77 million. We expect R&D expense for the year will be between $88 million and $90 million. Fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between 41.5 million and 42 million shares. GAAP earnings per share assumes an estimated annual effective tax rate of negative 12% after discrete tax items, and includes approximately $65 million of estimated discrete tax benefits related to share-based compensation, which may vary significantly based on the timing and volume of stock option exercises. Our estimated non-GAAP effective – annual effective tax rate for 2020 is 24%. We expect our total capital expenditures will be between $30 million and $31 million for the year, including approximately $10 million related to real estate and approximately $6 million of capitalized software development costs. Total depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $81 million, including approximately $54 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Lynn for some additional comments.
H. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Thanks, Brian. With the challenges our clients face as a result of the spread of COVID-19, our clients' need for digital connectedness, both within their organizations and directly with the public is rapidly shifting from a vision to an urgent requirement. We're gratified by the accolades Tyler is receiving for our innovations to help our clients address the challenges of the current environment. During the third quarter, our Virtual Court solution, which has been selected by approximately 60 courts nationwide, received the AWS Best Remote Work Solution award in conjunction with its use in the city of Alvin, Texas. We also won the Coolest Overall Technology Innovation Award from School Technology (sic) [Transportation] (17:21) News for our new bus attendance application, which works with Tyler's bus routing solutions to provide schools a tool for limiting bus capacity, contact tracing and social distancing on the school bus. On the product development front, we are continuing all of our strategic initiatives, including product R&D projects, and accelerating our move to the cloud and still expect that R&D expense will grow at more than 9% for the year. While some of our competitors are laying off staff, we continue to add new employees to support long-term growth opportunities, and we added 27 net new heads during the third quarter, mostly in product development. We also continue to adapt our operations, providing client support and delivering professional services such as training remotely and executing complex go-lives virtually, improving utilization and eliminating most travel costs. Many administrative and sales and marketing activities, including sales demos, trade shows and user group meetings are also being conducted virtually with reductions in associated expenses. We continue to explore the possibility of greater numbers of employees working remotely, even after our offices fully reopen. Lower expenses have more than offset revenue reductions relative to our pre-COVID plan, resulting in margin expansion. Some of these expense reductions, such as sales commissions and health claims are short-term in nature, but we do expect that some savings will be sustainable. As a result, we expect to continue to see year-over-year margin expansion in the fourth quarter. We expect that revenue growth for the fourth quarter will continue to be significantly impacted by the pandemic, and to a much lesser extent, the IT security incident. Although our variable revenue streams will continue to be affected by the current environment, we anticipate that recurring revenues, which comprise more than 70% of our total revenues, will continue to be relatively unaffected. While we remain confident in our long-term outlook, there are uncertainties around the continuously evolving COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our operations and those of our clients. For example, government response to the pandemic continued to vary significantly from state-to-state and even from jurisdiction-to-jurisdiction within a state, thereby making the duration and scope of business restrictions within the public sector difficult to predict. Many public sector entities are facing near-term budget pressures that could cause them to delay spending in the coming year. The COVID-19 pandemic has not changed our view of the underlying fundamentals and long-term demand for our software. If anything, the current crisis is highlighting the unsustainable reliance on outdated technology by much of the public sector. Technology is an increasingly critical factor in helping government function effectively, especially in difficult times. While it is too soon to fully assess the impact of the elections, we expect that additional federal stimulus will be forthcoming to provide further economic aid to state and local governments. We are confident that new long-term opportunities will emerge from this crisis, as both Tyler and our clients reexamine historical business practices. And that Tyler is better positioned than our competitors to provide innovative solutions to help our clients meet new challenges. Our balance sheet is stronger than ever, with $650 million in cash and investments and no debt. We plan to continue to invest at a high level in R&D and actively pursue M&A opportunities to broaden our total addressable market and build on our strong competitive position. I continue to be extremely proud and inspired by how the entire Tyler team has risen to face the challenges of this year head on, supporting our clients as well as each other. We are confident in the fundamental strengths of the public sector market and our ability to grow and invest in strategic initiatives in a difficult environment, and we look forward to executing our long-term strategies until conditions allow us to return to a higher growth market. Now, we'll take questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And your first question today will come from Peter Heckmann with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.
Peter J. Heckmann - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking the questions. As regards additional federal government stimulus, there were some – there was a bill floated earlier in the year – just focused on technology modernization. Can you talk about the different types of programs that might be pending and where you expect both broad stimulus funds to help municipal budgets, but as well, any directed programs that you're watching that you think could be relatively near term.
H. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, sure, Pete. And you're right. I think generally speaking, there's an expectation that there's going to be another round of stimulus. I think both political parties agree on that. I think for certain that the last month or so, maybe two months, it's become a little bit more of a politicized issue that I think will get behind us, now that the election is behind us. In fact, I read an article this morning where Mitch McConnell in the Senate said that getting a stimulus passed by the end of the year was his new top priority as well as – and he made a comment specifically – as well as state and local government stimulus. So, I think that's coming. I think that's the expectation. It's hard to know exactly where everything's going to shake out, but I do think it will become a priority following this election, once things settle out a little bit more. I think I talked about last time – at the last call – the prior Fed Chairman Bernanke, he made a comment coming out of the Great Recession, that one of the things that they, I think, sort of missed the boat on was they did not devote enough money to state and local governments when they were doing their stimulus then. I think that's a significant priority. We've also talked about the Fed has specific bond buying programs for counties and cities, and I think that's going to continue. So, the expectation is there. I think the expectations for our clients, I think there's – that's part of the hesitancy going on right now – but I see that coming on the horizon.
Brian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: And I'd add one other thing. I think what you were alluding to there is, there does seem to be bipartisan efforts to provide more funding, specifically for state and local government IT upgrades. There was an act – The State and Local IT Modernization and Cybersecurity Act that was proposed back in August – and that act would provide $28 billion over the next five years, specifically to upgrade government IT systems. So, the upgrading of systems is certainly something that the federal government recognizes is important.
Peter J. Heckmann - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Got it. Got it. That's helpful. And then just in terms of where budgets are right now, typically, the fourth quarter is strong for public safety. Public safety seems to have a fair amount of momentum and encouraging to hear bigger solution sets and bigger deal sizes in public safety, but do you think based on where we are we, you're on track with public safety bookings for the fourth quarter or are you – I guess what's your level of comfort that you'll hit your targets there on the public safety side.
H. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, Pete, I think that's a good question. And the short answer is yes. And what we've seen, generally is, we've seen a little bit of difference in terms of bit of difference in terms of different market segments but public safety the demand's still there. We expect some significant deals to still come through in the fourth quarter. I think one of the things that's encouraging about public safety is as we continue to invest and we've added more portfolio of products to their bag, is that, historically, the fourth quarter was – was one that was, I think, a little more skewed towards their license deals and it still is. But as that business grows and as it gains traction, we're starting to sort of level that out a bit. We've had, as we noted, we had for the first time ever two license deals over $1 million in Q3, which is pretty incredible. In fact, now I think it's now three of the last four quarters, we've had license deals in excess of $1.5 million. So the momentum's there in public safety. It's funny, I think 10 days from now will be our five year anniversary of acquiring that, and I think it's a testament to the work that those people have put in and the investments we've put in. And we talk about how it takes a little bit of time with some of these investments, these acquisitions, and they're really starting to hit their stride; they're doing a great job.
Peter J. Heckmann - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Good, good to hear. I'll get back in the queue. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt VanVliet of BTIG. Please proceed with your question.
Matthew David VanVliet - BTIG LLC: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I really appreciate it. I guess, on the front of the services disruption from the ransomware attack. Maybe not a question directly from that, but as how it impacted you during the quarter? You talked about inability or, I guess, a disruption in delivering some of your projects. Was that a reallocation of resources or were you forced to kind of dig a little deeper with some of those customers and assess sort of what happened and sort of give them some additional information to make sure that they were comfortable moving forward? And then on the same front, sort of how that might have impacted overall pipeline processes going on?
H. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yes. So – and you – I don't want to go into too much more detail. But the short answer is, as we talked about, the incident was really all about our internal systems. It was about our phone systems, our website and things of that nature. However, out of abundance of caution, what we, as I mentioned in my comments, what we did was we immediately shut down all external points of entry. So, that disrupted things like being able to conduct – we do a lot of services – support was disrupted. We weren't able to send e-mails with attachments for a while. And really that, again, that was just out of abundance of caution. So, it was really short term. To your second question, as it relates to pipeline, it has not had any impact really on our pipeline. There was obviously a little short-term disruption, but we haven't seen anything meaningful in terms of future impact of sales or anything like that.
Matthew David VanVliet - BTIG LLC: And then, looking at your overall sort of K-through-12 school customer base and potential customers out there, how much of a disruption to their overall typical operational processes – the limited, maybe in-person schooling or definite hybrid situations out there – are either changing that narrative or accelerating some of those deals that they now feel like they need to have more technology in place, more ability to work remotely and have more digital services in place.
H. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, so I would say two things. As it relates to schools, in particular, I'd say that's one area right now where budget impacts is sort of constraining some deals from moving forward; it's pushing some things out. At the same time, you're right. It's absolutely highlighting – and this goes beyond schools – it's highlighting the need for technology. I think when I look at the business overall of the public sector, I think the shift that we're starting to see, that part of it's due to COVID, but it's new, more online, mobile, public access – things that are interaction with the parents, with the schools – but even more just citizens engaging with their communities. That's something that's going to continue. And I think that was the future anyway, but I think COVID has really sort of accelerated that. So, and I think what's encouraging about that to me, Matt, is that Tyler really is out in the forefront of this. We're the best positioned for this. This brings in our whole Connected Communities vision and things that we're already doing. And so it really puts us in a great position when things – when we sort of get on the other side of this.
Matthew David VanVliet - BTIG LLC: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Charlie Strauzer of CJS Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Charles Strauzer - CJS Securities, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Can you talk a little bit maybe just give kind of a quick early view of next year? I know usually you give more detailed guidance on the next call, but just given that you saw a return to growth in Q3, maybe just some early thoughts on next year.
H. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yes. Sure, Charlie. And I guess I'd start off by saying – and we talked about on the last call – is we don't see any real meaningful change in our pipeline. We know the demand for our services don't go away. We remember how we started the year in the first quarter before it hit. We were out to a really great start and so we sort of expect that to continue. At the same time, we also talked about we're in the middle of these June 30, July 1 budget cycles right now. So my expectation is that there will be some hangover. still be some delays in some deals, still some clients that are reluctant to open up and do some remote delivery of services. We're still waiting to see courts opening back up, so some of our transaction volumes kick up. I'd say stepping back on a high side, just sort of generally, you're right. We are in the budget process right now. It is a little bit early. I'd say on the revenue side, I would expect revenue growth to be higher than what it's been in 2020, but probably not a full return to sort of our pre-COVID expectations of high single digits, 9%, 10%, 11% growth. But I do expect it to be better than this year. But that's kind of where we are on the revenue side.
Charles Strauzer - CJS Securities, Inc.: That's very helpful. Thanks, Lynn. And secondly, just you're generating a ton of cash, really just want to just get a better sense of now that you've got so much cash on the balance sheet, any change in priorities for the use of cash? Is M&A something that's more of a priority and are you seeing any pipeline activity in the M&A front?
H. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yes. Sure, Charlie. And yes, we're always – we've talked before – we're always looking at deals and that's continued. That has not slowed down during COVID. In fact, one of the things that we've done over the last six months, you probably remember us talking about over the last couple of years is our white space initiative. We've actually taken the time, dived a little deeper, refined that, and really making that forefront. We're going to continue to be opportunistic on those deals. But we're out there, we're looking. I would like to see us do some deals, and so we're out there looking.
Charles Strauzer - CJS Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Oliver with Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Rob Oliver - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you, guys, for taking my question. Good morning. Lynn, one for you and then I had a follow-up for Brian. Lynn, so I think it was around this time year that you guys started to see that cross-sell traction in New World Public Safety into some of your existing Tyler accounts. I think it started on your home turf in Texas. And I'm curious, you mentioned that the federation approach starting to take hold. Curious this quarter with that strength that you saw in public safety, it's getting a bit more linear and less back-end loaded, are you seeing that trend continue where you're seeing pull-through from Tyler customers that are also committing on the public safety side as well and how that's progressing?
H. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: We are. We've gotten, as you mentioned, we – I think some of the initial traction was in Texas. We're seeing some good things on the West Coast in California. I think what's particularly encouraging is this continued move-up market, which is also part of the fact that we're – the Tyler Alliance story – the total Tyler story is really starting to resonate. The largest deal they did this quarter was Sedgwick County, Kansas, that was about a $1.6 million license deal. And that was a full suite of CAD, enterprise records, but also pulling through things – SoftCode, our field reporting, Tyler Corrections, Brazos, Socrata, Mobility – all these things. And that's part of that strategy as well. And I think the key selling point there was really the whole Tyler Alliance story. And that's what – that's the feedback we've gotten from the field and the client. And that's what's also encouraging because as we know, there's – there isn't anybody else out there that can compete on that level. And in fact, the competitor we had in that was Motorola. So it's particularly gratifying to see these strategies start to play out and start to win these bigger deals, which include going upmarket as you – but also as you say – leveraging other Tyler relationships, other Tyler products to get these deals.
Rob Oliver - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks, Lynn, appreciate that. And then, Brian, just for you, you guys are executing really well on the margin front with the strong margin growth year-over-year. And just curious, I know some of those benefits likely come from COVID, but if we could just get some color on how that breakdown might be to think about what was a COVID benefit and what might be something that's more sustainable in terms of margin benefit? Thanks, guys.
Brian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yes. And as we work through our planning for next year, we'll have a better idea of how those – how much of it is actually sustainable. Coming into the year, pre-COVID, we had had a goal kind of holding margins flat with last year after a couple of down years as a result of our significant increases in R&D. We've continued to spend R&D pretty close to what we expected for the year, but we're now up – this quarter – up 300 basis points. I don't expect that the margin growth will be as high in Q4 or that we'll see 300 basis points next year. But we do expect that we'll be back on a margin expansion opportunity in that a significant part of the gains, although they've come about because of COVID, we've been able to change business practices, particularly remote delivery of services, changing the way we approach some things like trade shows, eliminating a lot of administrative travel that I think will be permanent gains. So, if you look at the 300 basis points we picked up this quarter, maybe as much as half of that would be a sustainable kind of a gain.
Rob Oliver - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thanks again.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jonathan Ho with William Blair & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to just start out with maybe getting a little bit more clarity around sort of the reduction in the full year revenue guidance. Was this mainly due to, I guess, the issue faced, just wanted to get maybe just the main factors behind that.
Brian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Sure. Yes, if you look at the change in our full year revenue guidance, I believe the midpoint of our guidance came down by about $11 million compared to where that was when we reinitiated guidance after Q2. About $4 million of that is what we talked about earlier on the call related to the IT security incident where we lost primarily services revenues, some license revenues, as a result of a lack of ability to interface with clients while our systems were compromised. There's about $1 million related to lower e-filing volumes, as courts have not reopened as fast as we anticipated at the end of Q2. A lot of e-filing volume is around evictions and debt collections. And as you know, there's – the CDC has now put in place a broader moratorium on evictions and so those volumes are lower than we expected. And then there's about roughly $8 million of an effect on licenses, which are primarily sales delays, processes being pushed out, and that's a combination really of COVID and its impact on our clients' ability to work remotely, and budget pressures (39:18) as well. So those are – and then lastly – licenses are also being affected by a greater shift towards SaaS in our pipeline than even we anticipated at the end of the second quarter, for the reasons we talked about, Lynn talked about earlier on the call.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. And just to build on that, with budget pressure on state and local governments, are you starting to see, I guess, a greater desirability towards moving to cloud and SaaS solutions and particularly, for the cost savings side, is that starting to accelerate? Thanks.
H. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yes, Jonathan, I think that's a good observation. And I think going in – pre-COVID – we were already starting to see this shift in the market and I think that was going to continue on its own anyway. I think, secondly, as we've talked about over the last year plus or two years, as Tyler has shifted its approach from more of a cloud agnostic to more cloud preferred or cloud first, we're doing things with how we do our sales and how we inform clients. And so, I think that's been part of it. But absolutely, COVID has played a role there. And we're seeing that really across all of our divisions. I mean we're seeing it – our Munis ERP – they're all coming in right now at rates, subscription rates that were higher than their original 2020 plan. And so that's definitely occurring, and again, the good news is that we've been preparing for it and ready for it and we've been investing towards there. So it's a short-term headwind, continues to be, but that trend is going to continue, I believe.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question.
Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. To come back to the transaction costs and some of the delays you're seeing in evictions and recovery of debt, does this perhaps create a pent-up demand as we look into next year, assuming that some of these restrictions let up and the courts kind of open up. Are we perhaps looking to have an opportunity for significant revenue growth from that area next year?
H. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yes, Keith, that's a good observation. I think that's right. That's certainly our expectation. I mean, even though courts have been starting to reopen some, as Brian mentioned, there has been this moratorium. And really about almost two-thirds of court filings are either debt-related or landlord-tenant eviction type things. So, our expectation is that, that will go up. Even when you look at sort of on the more municipal side or traffic side, you don't have a lot of citations out there. You don't have a lot of people paying court fines and things like that on the – more on the municipal side – but we would expect that those will return to normal. But in terms of the backlog on the civil side, yes, I think that's our current expectation.
Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Great. And Brian, just a follow-up for you. Gross margins came in probably the best that I remember them being. Maybe it's more just a geography question more than anything else, but is that more due to lower travel costs? Or was there other items going on in gross margins that perhaps are sustainable going forward?
Brian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Well, a big piece of that, both at the gross and operating margin is the absence of billable travel, which has essentially no margin on it. And so that continues to – that loss of that revenue continues to be – have a positive impact. That's probably the biggest point. The other thing is we are seeing, as we move to the remote delivery of services, we actually gain utilization and efficiency there because we're not putting people on airplanes every Monday and every Friday, and we're able to use that time to deliver services. And so, that shift is having a positive impact as well. And that is something that we expect to be sustainable. Although certainly in the future, there will be some billable travel and some return to on-site services, we believe that in the long-term, we'll continue to deliver a significant amount of services remotely as our experience over the last two or three quarters is proving that that can be done very effectively and clients are increasingly accepting of that model.
Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Scott Berg with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Scott Berg - Needham & Co. LLC: Hi, Lynn, Hi, Brian. Congrats on a good quarter and thanks for taking my questions. I guess two questions. Let's start off with Lynn, on the public safety side. You talked about how – I think it's three of the last four quarters you had $1 million-plus transactions. Obviously, your sales traction has been very strong there, with how you've been able to add some new innovation of the product and pushed upmarket. But as you look at those deals today, versus maybe three or four years from now, is it simply just your ability to take the same product and move it upmarket or has that product evolved at all? And you've had maybe better success selling, maybe either more or different modules within that suite that's relatively broad at the end of the day.
H. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yes, Scott, it's actually – it's quite a number of factors. And I want to be clear, is through last four quarters, we've had license deals in excess of $1.5 million, which is even better. And you're right, it's – we've done a lot over the last several years, both in terms of expanding our functionality. We're now responding to more RFPs, than we could before. We're more compliant than we were before. So, we've made the product much more robust. In addition, it's hard to underestimate, really what we've done on the service side as well, really shoring up client references. As we've introduced these new products, CAD and e-records, the number of go-lives that have been successful, in getting those references, that's the stuff we don't spend a lot of time talking about. But one of the biggest initiatives this year was our e-records which was going about (45:52) the same as the CAD. They had, I think, 15 big go-lives scheduled for this year and a number of those had pushed back a little bit just because of COVID, but we're on track to get all those done. We've had 11 of them successful. And that's the hard stuff and it's that referenceability. But then when you talk about, again, moving upmarket, it's all these tuck-in acquisitions and integrating them. It's these things like SceneDoc, SoftCode, Brazos, Socrata. And what you don't ever know is, in these big deals, you never know exactly what's the tipping point. But our – what we can deliver, the full suite of products – is so much more competitive and then it's so much more broader than what other people are offering that it just becomes very compelling.
Scott Berg - Needham & Co. LLC: Got it. Quite helpful and then from a follow-up perspective and one of your other questions here shortly, a few minutes ago, Lynn, you talked about how public safety transactions and what's usually a seasonally stronger fourth quarter looked like you're generally on track. With the earlier comments about pipelines kind of slipping and some deals moving into maybe the first half of 2021, what are the product areas that are seeing the most delays there, if it's not public safety?
H. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: So, I would say the area where we're seeing probably more delays is really on the higher end of the ERP space, more of our Munis line. It's interesting the lower end is not seeing the same right now. But then again, stepping back, it was that high-end ERP space that really got out of the gate fast in Q1 and that's what's still so encouraging. We've talked about how the demand didn't go away. What seems to be happening there, as opposed to say, in our Justice solutions or even the lower end space, is that some counties – there's that uncertainty out there – but they just seem to be a little bit more willing to push it out a little bit further, or I'd say, hang on another year. I'd almost analogize it to – you've got a car, an old car you've had since college – and you've got a couple of kids and a spouse and that car's starting to spend more time in the shop than on the road. And you know it's time to get that thing fixed, but golly, your kids who have braces coming up this year or something happening with one of your jobs. You say, I'm going to hang on one more year before I do it. And I think we're seeing that there more so than, say, on the other sides of the business.
Scott Berg - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the good quarter, again.
Operator: Your next question comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore. Please proceed with your question.
Kirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC: Yeah, thanks very much and congrats on a good quarter in a tough environment. Lynn, maybe I was curious about just sort of your philosophy these days on using pricing maybe more as a weapon, given that you're much bigger today than you were back in the economic recession 10 years ago. And just whether or not that resonates with clients or not, meaning, are there things you all can do from an upfront pricing perspective that can help you maybe take share in this period of uncertainty? And I guess, how do you balance that? Because I would think you're now at a point where, as customers are looking to consolidate vendors, if you can help them maybe get over the hump today and hopefully their budgeting problems resolve themselves in the next 12, 18 months, that can make some sense in terms of taking more market share. But just kind of – can you just give me an idea of how you're kind of thinking about that, if at all?
H. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, sure, Kirk. I think we're doing a little bit of that, and we're doing a little bit of that with some of these products that we're really planning to try to introduce this year or that we really were expecting to sort of jump start this year. And I'm not talking about our major core apps, but some of our smaller products around that, be it – we talked before about at Socrata Data & Insights or our product called Executive Insights. We're doing things there like offering one-year free Premier Executive Insight. We've talked about it with virtual courts. We've done these free trial periods. We're doing things like that around our Tyler Detect, which is our cybersecurity, our research, taxes, things like that. So, we are seeing some of that right now. In terms of "gaining market share", I think the things that we're doing right now by keeping our investments at the level and accelerating some of them being in that position to really capitalize, knowing that we went into this already in probably the strongest position in the market. And the way I view it, really, Kirk, is that as we're dealing with the effects of this pandemic – and we know it's going to end and we know the demand is going to be there – but every quarter that goes by, Tyler itself is getting stronger and stronger. Our balance sheet is getting stronger. We're investing. Every quarter goes by, we're another quarter down in our R&D and further along in our investments. We don't believe our competitors are doing the same. And so, I really like our position right now. And yeah, we're looking at things like that on some of these products we're trying to jump start, but we're not really doing that really across our core apps right now.
Kirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess for you or maybe Brian, just you've mentioned M&A a couple of times. Has the environment for doing deals gotten better perhaps over the last six months as smaller vendors are obviously probably feeling more pressure from either balance sheet or growth – revenue growth perspective. And obviously, valuations across software have been fairly robust over the last six months. So just kind of curious, I know you're always looking, but have the – I guess, has the bid-ask spread maybe started to narrow a little bit on things that you find attractive, maybe relative to six or nine months ago?
H. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: I'd say that in terms of the sort of number of deals we look at, it's probably kind of consistent with what we were before. I haven't seen any really increased activity there. I think my expectation, if you go back to the Q1 call, my expectation might have been – you might have seen more on the valuation front. I think some of them may have come down a little bit, but the broader market is still doing pretty well. I'm talking about the public markets and sometimes people tend to point to that when they shouldn't. But we haven't seen any meaningful expectations right now out of valuation, probably about the same as before.
Kirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC: Okay. Great. That's it for me. Thanks guys. Take care.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brent Bracelin of Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.
Brent A, Bracelin - Piper Sandler & Co. (Broker): Thanks, and good afternoon. I guess, Lynn, I wanted to go back to this concept of this digital wakening that we're clearly seeing across other enterprises, other segments of the market. On one hand, totally appreciate a greater level of uncertainty with state and local budgets. But on the other hand, you do have kind of a new reality and a new digital reality. What are you seeing just from a state, local engagement activity metric? You talked a little bit about seeing larger deals materialize because of maybe this digital shift, but is the engagement activity picking up as well, too? I get there will be budget uncertainty, but is the – is there anything you can see that gives you more confidence that that shift to digital could also accelerate in that government vertical?
H. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, I do believe the shift to how government's going to operate, how they're going to deliver services to their citizens, I believe that was going to change pre-COVID, and I think it's going to change and accelerate past that. And one of the things I talk about is, you look at your kids and you look at how they think about technology and how they use technology, well, they're going to grow up. They're the citizens of the future – they're citizens today, but they're the ones that are – they're going to demand more. They're going to demand that government works the way everything else in their lives work. Earlier this week, I was – I did an interview for the National League of Cities. We talked with Clarence Anthony, the CEO there, and this is for their upcoming user conference. We spent a lot of time talking about the cloud and the local government shift and move to the cloud. And to me, it's something that's coming. It was coming anyway. I think COVID is accelerating that. And you talk about budget constraints. I mean, that's one of the factors about that. You've got, as you move to the cloud, you do create some budget certainty. You take away sort of some of the uncertainties of these large capital spends. You talk about security in today's world. We spent a lot of time talking about cybersecurity. And the cloud is such a more secure environment and you're dealing with these players like AWS who we're aligned with, they've got all kinds of resources to spend on that infrastructure, and that's their business. And that's not really that's not really a local government's business. And so – and I think they're starting to recognize that. And so, I do think the shift is real and I do think it's accelerating.
Brent A, Bracelin - Piper Sandler & Co. (Broker): Great. That's encouraging. And just one quick follow-up for Brian, if I could. We're seeing more talk of statewide deals. And I don't think we kind of really saw that in the past. As you look at the pipeline, is there a healthy amount of activity on more statewide deals? Just trying to understand that statewide deal trend that you've seen in Kansas, Washington State, North Carolina. I'd just love to hear the pipeline of activity around kind of statewide and what's driving that. Thanks.
Brian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yes. I'd say it's a little bit of a mixed bag. State is certainly an area that today is probably less than 15% of our revenue – somewhere between 10% and 15%. And I think it represents in the long-term, a big growth opportunity for us as we expand – move some of our products upmarket into the state and sell some of our products that are used locally, sell them statewide. We've had some really good examples of that in the last couple of years. Our school bus transportation system Versatrans had a great statewide deal in the Carolinas. North Carolina, adopting Brazos and our new e-warrants solution statewide, where those have typically been purchased at the local level, and they did that in conjunction with implementing our Odyssey court system statewide. Just this quarter, we had a significant win with our probation system with the state of Nevada. It's the first time we've had a state-level contract for that product, and that's a product we acquired about a year ago. So, and obviously with Odyssey, we've had a significant statewide presence where a lot of court systems, maybe 40 of the 50 state court systems – court systems are operated at the state level – and we've had great success there over the years. So I do expect we'll continue to build on that. In our Federal division, the MicroPact business we acquired a little over a year ago, that I'd say right now, probably the greatest pressure they're seeing is in their state market. But I think that's really a short-term phenomenon, and that's really around budget pressures. But we do expect to grow our state business and certainly our federal business as we expand beyond our traditional focus just on local government.
Brent A, Bracelin - Piper Sandler & Co. (Broker): Helpful color there. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Wilson with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Scott Wilson - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the call. Maybe first for Lynn, to better understand kind of what's informing your expectation for better revenue growth, but still kind of growth below your target 9%, 10%, 11% next year. Can you comment on what you're seeing in your end market in terms of RFP activity? Are you starting to see that come back or is it still below historical levels? And has there been any change in the types of RFPs that are coming to market, maybe in terms of size or the products that are in demand in the current environment?
H. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yes. So again, we're still early in our process. What we're seeing in RFP activity, again, it's sort of mirrors what we're seeing right now across Tyler. There are certain areas that we're not feeling the impact. It's – the delays are shorter. The pipe is there. The RFP activity is still pretty good. It's a little softer in a few areas. And part of it's recognizing that the time from RFP to getting a deal done, it does take time. You're certainly aware of our sales cycle. So it is a – it's very preliminary right now, but we do drill down. We look – we build bottoms-up budgets – we look at RFP. We look at all those leading indicators, RFPs and demos and things like that, even RFIs. And so that's really what it's based on right now, but again, it's preliminary.
Scott Wilson - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. Understood. And then maybe a quick one for Brian. To put a finer point on kind of your margin expansion commentary. I guess, historically, you've talked about 50 to 100 bps of margin expansion annually. Is that still in the cards for next year given the outsized expansion you've seen this year? Or should we be kind of thinking about maybe a more modest step back in terms of that type of expansion next year?
Brian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Again, we've got a lot of work to do on our planning process, but I would say we – and even pre-COVID – we expected that 2021 would be a year where we would return to margin expansion. And so if I were guessing, I'd say probably in that range, but probably on the lower end.
Scott Wilson - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Makes sense. Thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Goodwin of JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Joe Goodwin - JMP Securities LLC: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Just curious on – when you're doing a conversion from an on-premise customer into the cloud or subscription, do – and I understand this might vary across products, across Tyler. But is there – do customers need to be on a specific version before actually moving to the cloud or under the subscription? Is there any dynamic there or can they go from any version direct to the cloud? Thank you.
H. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yes. No, there's not a – they don't need to be upgraded to the most current version to make that transition.
Joe Goodwin - JMP Securities LLC: Understood. Thank you.
Operator: At this time, there appears to be no further questions. Mr. Moore, I'll turn back to you for any closing remarks.
H. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Eric, and thanks everybody for joining us today. I certainly appreciate the interest, and we hope you stay safe and healthy. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Brian Miller or myself. Thanks, everybody.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you very much for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-08-01 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to today's Tyler Technologies Second Quarter 2020 Conference Call. Your host for today's call is Lynn Moore, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is recorded today, July 30, 2020. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Moore. Please go ahead.
Lynn Moore: Thank you, Danielle, and welcome to our second quarter 2020 earnings call. With me on the call today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like for Brian to give the safe harbor statement. Next, I'll have some preliminary comments, and Brian will review the details of our second quarter results. Then I'll have some additional comments, and we'll take questions.
Brian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. During the course of this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information and may include projections concerning the company's future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Lynn?
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. We executed at a high level during the second quarter, as the effects of COVID-19 pandemic continued. From a financial perspective, GAAP revenues declined 1.5%, and non-GAAP revenues declined 2.4%. Revenues for the quarter were approximately $35 million below our pre-COVID plan. Many procurement processes encountered delays, as clients focused on addressing COVID-19, resulting in several contracts being pushed out of the quarter, reducing license and, to a lesser extent, subscription revenues. Also, services revenue was negatively impacted during the quarter as billable travel was essentially eliminated and fewer hours were delivered as we transition to providing most services remotely. As I noted on our last earnings call, due to concerns with COVID-19, our annual Connect user conference was canceled. And although a majority of the content was delivered virtually, we lost more than $6 million of revenue that would have been recognized in the second quarter. Recurring revenues remained strong. GAAP subscription revenues grew 16.6%, and non-GAAP subscription revenues grew 15.6%. Together, total recurring revenues from maintenance and subscriptions grew 12.3% on a GAAP basis and comprise approximately 75% of total revenues. On the positive side, operating expenses were also well below our original plan. We experienced significant savings in commissions, travel, marketing, health claims and other employee-related expenses. As a result, our operating margins expanded, with our non-GAAP operating margin up 290 basis points to 27.5%. Our cash flow was another high point in our results, with free cash flow up 226% over last year's second quarter. Bookings for the quarter were approximately $309 million, and as expected, declined 31.6% due to the very difficult comparison to the second quarter of 2019, which included 2 very large SaaS deals, 1 for the North Carolina Administrative Office of the Courts, and the other with Bayer County, Texas. Excluding these two contracts, bookings declined approximately 10.9%. Although we have not seen meaningful cancellations, we are seeing delays in procurement processes and lengthening sales cycles due to the effects of COVID-19, which impacted bookings this quarter. As we have discussed in the past, our new deal mix can be somewhat lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, as was the case this quarter. The number of new software deals was weighted towards SaaS, with 66% of the total. However, the value of the new software deal is weighed towards on-premise license arrangements at 57%, as more of the larger deals that signed this quarter chose on-premises. Our largest deal in the quarter was a license arrangement with the state of West Virginia, valued at approximately $9 million for our iasWorld Appraisal solution, including appraisal services. Perhaps the most significant contract signed in the quarter was a public safety arrangement with Jacksonville, Florida, for our New World Public Safety records management and Brazos eCitation solutions, along with our Socrata Data & Insights, SceneDoc and SoftCode solutions, valued at approximately $5 million. Jacksonville, the 13th largest city in the nation, represents our largest public safety client to date. This one is important because it not only validates the significant investments we've made in the New World suite to position it to become competitive in Tier 1, but also showcases the strategic value of the acquisitions we've made in recent years. Other notable license deals during the quarter included an Odyssey court case management contracts, with the 10th Judicial Court in Johnson County, Kansas, which completes our state-wide presence in Kansas. Along with contracts for our MicroPact entellitrak solution, with the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission and the United States Department of Agriculture. In fact, three of our seven largest license deals in the quarter were for our MicroPact entellitrak solutions. We added two new counties in California for Odyssey, a licensed contract with Calusa County and a SaaS contract with Mariposa County. We've now won six of six California court deals that have been executed since the state-provided new funding for case management system replacements last year. Our largest SaaS deal in the quarter was a $3 million contract with Clay County, Florida for our EnerGov Civic services solution. We also signed a SaaS deal for EnerGov with the city of Sunnyvale, California, valued at approximately $1.3 million. Other significant SaaS arrangements signed this quarter were with the Bellevue School District in the state of Washington and the City of Lynn, Massachusetts for our Munis ERP solution, with the Abu Dhabi Global markets for our Modria Online Dispute Resolution solution with the Kansas Supreme Court for our CaseloadPRO solution, and with Clearmount County, Ohio for our Socrata Data & Insight solution. In addition, 42 existing on-premises clients signed contracts to move to the cloud, including Oasis County, Texas, with Odyssey Courts; Franklin County, Ohio and the Cab County, Georgia, with iasWorld Appraisal & Tax; and Alameda County in California with CaseloadPRO supervision. We also delivered the initial version of our e-warrant system to the state of North Carolina under the contract we signed late in Q1. We also have trial programs underway for e-warrants with 2 counties in Texas. Now I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter.
Brian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2020. In our earnings release, we've included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financial Reports tab, schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. This was the first time we've had a year-over-year decline in quarterly revenue since the fourth quarter of 2010, just before we emerge from the effects of the Great Recession, and ended the streak of 34 quarters of double-digit revenue growth. GAAP revenues for the quarter were $271.1 million, down 1.5%. On a non-GAAP basis, revenues were $271.3 million, down 2.4%. Organic revenue growth was down 1.9% on a GAAP basis and 2.8% on a non-GAAP basis. Our core software and license -- software license and subscription revenues combined, grew 8.4% on a non-GAAP basis with 7.7% organic growth. Total revenues were about $35 million below our pre-COVID plan. Of that, approximately $11 million was attributed to delayed license and percentage of completion revenues; $8 million to professional services; $6.6 million to the cancellation of Connect; $4.5 million to billable travel; and $1.4 million to lower e-filing volumes. Subscription revenues for the quarter increased 16.6%. We added 125 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 42 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $39 million in total contract value. In Q2 of last year, we added 154 new subscription-based arrangements and had 27 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $128 million in total contract value. Subscription contract value comprised approximately 43% of the total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 80% in Q2 of last year. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 3.7 years compared to 6.1 years last year, when the average term was skewed by the 10-year $85 million contract with North Carolina. Revenues from e-filing and online payments, which are included in subscriptions, were relatively flat with Q2 of last year at $21.3 million. That amount includes e-filing revenues of $14.2 million, down 1.8% over last year and e-payments revenue of $7.1 million, up 5%. Lower volumes as a result of closed court operations in some jurisdictions reduced our transaction-based e-filing revenues by an estimated $1.4 million in the quarter. For the second quarter, our annualized non-GAAP total recurring revenue, or ARR, was approximately $810 million, up 10.7%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS arrangements for Q2 was approximately $258 million, up 21.7%. Transaction-based ARR was approximately $85 million, up 0.3%, and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was approximately $467 million, up 7.4%. Our backlog at the end of the quarter reached a new high of $1.54 billion, up 7.4%. As Lynn noted, our bookings declined by 31.6% to approximately $309 million against a very difficult comparison with Q2 of 2019. Last year's second quarter bookings were a record $452 million and included the largest contract in our history, the $85 million SaaS contract for the North Carolina courts as well as a $20 million SaaS contract with the Bexar County, Texas courts. Excluding those contracts from last year, the decline in bookings was 10.9%. However, for the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1.2 billion, up 3%. Our software subscription bookings in the quarter added $9.2 million in new annual recurring revenue. As in the first quarter, cash flows were very robust during the second quarter. Cash flows from operations increased 62.5% to $39.8 million, and free cash flow more than tripled to $31.5 million. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was negative as a result of discrete tax benefits related to stock compensation and lower cash taxes contributed to the cash flow growth. We ended the quarter with $473 million in cash and investments and no outstanding debt. Our guidance for the full-year of 2020 is as follows: we expect 2020 GAAP revenues will be between $1.124 billion and $1.144 billion, and non-GAAP revenues will be between $1.125 billion and $1.145 billion. We expect 2020 GAAP diluted EPS will be between $4.71 and $4.91 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect 2020 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $5.30 and $5.50. For the year, estimated pretax noncash share-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $79 million. We expect R&D expense for the year will be between $90 million and $92 million. Fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between 41.5 million and 42 million shares. GAAP earnings per share assumes an estimated annual effective tax rate of negative 23% after discrete tax items, includes approximately $82 million of estimated discrete tax benefits related to share-based compensation, which may vary based on the timing and volume of stock option exercises. Our estimated non-GAAP annual effective tax rate for 2020 is 24%. We expect our total capital expenditures will be between $34 million and $35 million for the year, including approximately $10 million related to real estate and approximately $6 million of capitalized software development costs. Total depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $81 million, including approximately $54 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Now I'd like to turn the call back to Lynn for some additional comments.
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. I want to provide an update on how Tyler Technologies is approaching the challenge of COVID-19 and its effects on our business and our clients. First, our operational response. Tyler's 5,500 professionals continue to provide a high standard of client service with minimal disruption. Our primary focus continues to be on ensuring that our employees and their families are safe and healthy, while supporting clients who provide essential services to the public. Since mid-March, almost all of our staff have worked from home, with all but the most crucial travel eliminated. Our clients have faced disruption to their operations, as they deal with the effects of the pandemic on their communities and, in some places, civil unrest and focus on providing vital services to their citizens. Since March, we have seen delays in some procurement processes, although most late-stage processes are moving forward. Some implementation appraisal service projects have also encountered delays, as clients grapple with balancing social distancing orders with conducting daily operations. We've imposed travel restrictions on our employees, which has all but eliminated our ability to provide services on-site and to visit prospective clients for sales calls and demos. Virtually every trade show has been canceled, as was our Tyler Connect user conference scheduled for late April. We are addressing the challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic by adapting the way we do business, including using web and video conferencing extensively for collaboration, conducting sales demos, providing client support and delivering professional services such as training remotely, and even executing complex go-lives virtually. With the spread of COVID-19, our clients' need for digital connectedness, both within their organizations and directly with the public, is rapidly shifting from a vision to an urgent requirement. In the last few months, we have seen numerous examples of our team members working to help our clients adapt to the current environment in truly amazing ways. I'd like to highlight a few examples. Following the cancellation of Connect, we offered much of the valuable content to all of our clients through a program called Still Connected, a series of live and recorded online sessions. We've delivered more than 320 sessions of content with 17,000 views of recorded webinars, enabling us to reach even more client personnel than would have attended Connect in person. We accelerated the launch of our new virtual court solution, which provides a turnkey platform built on AWS for conducting face-to-face court sessions with remote defendants over the web. We have offered it without charge for 90 days in order to help clients serve their constituents without interruption. 46 courts are now live, using the solution to handle cases remotely, while also broadening access to justice for disadvantaged or displaced defendants, and 18 additional courts are in the process of onboarding. And just yesterday, AWS recognized virtual court as the best remote work solution in the AWS 2020 public sector partner awards. Developers on our Versatrans team fast track development of a new bus attendants app that works with our school bus routing solutions to provide schools with a tool for limiting bus capacity and managing social distancing as well as facilitating contact tracing. Our Appraisal & Tax division worked with clients with active revaluation projects underway, including Delaware County, Pennsylvania and Franklin County, Ohio, to move to remote property valuation hearings. We've also pivoted from infield data collection work to using remote data to achieve equitable and repeatable property assessments that support vital property tax revenue streams for our clients. We successfully completed more than 180 go-lives across our product groups during the quarter, most with very few or no Tyler personnel on site. The port of Long Beach, California, the second busiest seaport in the U.S., became our third public safety client to go-live with our new enterprise record solution, along with our full suite of CAD, mobile, field reporting and shield force applications, with a contracted go-live time line that represented a 33% improvement over traditional time lines. And our Data & Insights division is working in innovative ways to use our Socrata platform to respond to COVID-19 with data. Our Open Data platform was rapidly established as a one-stop shop for information and services for citizens in Buffalo, New York during the pandemic. Tyler also published on the Socrata platform, our nursing home COVID tracker, an embeddable dashboard displaying detailed national nursing home data on COVID-19 at the county and state levels. I couldn't be prouder of how our 5,500 dedicated professionals are supporting each other, delivering exceptional client service and displaying the spirit of innovation that has long been a hallmark of Tyler's success. We've already discussed the financial impact of COVID-19 on our second quarter, with significant reductions to both revenues and costs. I'd like to add some comments on our current outlook for the rest of 2020 as well as provide some thoughts on the long-term outlook and prospects for Tyler. We believe the revenue impact on the second quarter was approximately $35 million, and we expect that revenue growth for the rest of the year will continue to be significantly impacted. While we have not seen meaningful cancellations, we continue to see delays in procurement processes and longer sales cycles, as public sector entities continue to focus on issues relating to the pandemic and remote work, which will delay the timing of license and, to a lesser extent, subscription revenues. We have proven that we can deliver the majority of our professional services remotely, but we expect to see lower software and appraisal services revenues as some projects are delayed by client availability or travel restrictions. Billable travel was impacted significantly in the second quarter as most travel ceased, and we now expect to see very little travel in the second half of the year. In addition, a number of courts have closed or limited operations during the pandemic, which will continue to impact transaction-based e-filing revenues during this period. While our variable revenue streams will continue to be affected by the current environment, we anticipate that recurring revenues, which now comprise 75% of our total revenues, will continue to be generally unaffected. Our July 1 maintenance renewals went into place with normal pricing, and we do not expect to see any changes in client retention. Lower expenses have more than offset revenue reductions relative to our pre-COVID-19 plan, resulting in margin expansion. Many of these expense reductions, such as sales commissions and health claims, are short-term in nature, but we do expect that some savings will be sustainable. For example, I expect that post-COVID, we will continue to deliver a significant amount of services remotely, improving utilization of our professional services teams and reducing travel expense. I expect that more of our administrative and sales and marketing activities, including trade shows, will also be conducted virtually in the future, with a reduction in associated expenses. We also will continue to explore the possibility of greater numbers of employees working remotely, even after our offices are fully opened. On the product development front, we are continuing all of our strategic initiatives, including product R&D projects and accelerating our move to the cloud and still expect that R&D expense will grow at more than 11% for the year. We have not laid off any personnel and do not expect to do so. And in fact, we added 46 new heads during the second quarter, mostly in R&D. As we remain confident in our long-term outlook, there are uncertainties around the continuously evolving COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our operations and those of our clients. For example, government response to the pandemic continues to vary significantly from state to state and even from jurisdiction to jurisdiction within a state, thereby making the duration and scope of business restrictions within the public sector difficult to predict. Although the CARES Act provided approximately $424 billion in economic aid to state and local governments, an additional stimulus packages will likely provide more assistance, many of our clients face near-term budget pressures that could cause them to defer purchases. After suspending our guidance last quarter, we have reinstituted annual guidance for 2020 based on our high percentage of our recurring revenues and visibility in the pipeline for the second half, tempered by ongoing uncertainties around COVID-19. The midpoint of our non-GAAP revenue guidance implies growth of about 4% for the full year, along with operating margin expansion. As I said last quarter, I remain as confident as ever in Tyler's long-term outlook and prospects. Our company's fundamentals have never been stronger. And just as we did following the challenges of the dot-com bust, 9/11 and the Great Recession, we expect to emerge as a stronger company with an improved competitive position. The pandemic has not changed the underlying fundamentals and long-term demand for our software and services. Tyler exclusively serves the public sector and our clients will not go out of business. The solutions we provide are essential, whether managing revenue that keeps communities operating, ensuring public safety to help the most vulnerable or providing transparency and access to government for the residents of jurisdictions we serve. Our software manages mission-critical functions such as 911, courts, property taxes, utilities and payroll. Our clients generally acquire new solutions to replace aging systems that are at end of life and may be unreliable or unsupported, usually a high priority regardless of the economic environment. If anything, the current crisis is highlighting the unsustainable reliance on outdated technology by much of the public sector. Technology is an increasingly critical factor in helping government function effectively, especially in difficult times. Long-term opportunities will emerge from this crisis, as both Tyler and our clients reexamine historical business practices. For example, work-from-home postures further highlight the need and benefits of connectivity and cloud services, something we have been actively investing in and are continuing with our strategic collaboration with AWS. Clients will continue to appreciate the value of data and being connected with others, other departments and jurisdictions as well as with citizens. This is our connected communities' vision, a vision that only Tyler can execute. Our ability to deliver uninterrupted high-quality services and support during these difficult times only further strengthens our bonds with clients and reinforce Tyler's messages in both agility and stability. As I mentioned earlier, Tyler has endured challenging times in the past and emerged stronger than before. Today, we believe we are even better positioned to weather the economic slowdown. Recurring revenues made up 75% of our total this quarter. Our competitive position in win rates remains strong, and we have significantly expanded our total addressable market through investments in a combination of M&A and R&D. Our financial position today is also the strongest it's ever been, with 0 debt, approximately $530 million in cash and investments and substantial additional liquidity available through our $400 million undrawn credit facility. As a result, we're able to continue to invest at a high level in all of our long-term strategic initiatives, something that many of our competitors may not be able to do. Our ability to actively invest during the Great Recession was a key differentiator that strengthened our overall market position when demand inevitably returned. We will continue to do the same through this crisis. Finally, we achieved an important milestone last month when Tyler was added to the S&P 500. It's an honor to be listed among other innovative and highly regarded companies in the S&P 500 index. This recognition is the result of a lot of hard work by numerous employees over many years. Today, we have an incredibly talented team of 5,500 professionals with unmatched public sector experience and deep domain expertise. I'm proud to call them my colleagues, and I'm confident of our ability to together realize the opportunities ahead of us. Now we'll take questions, Danielle.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Peter Heckmann of D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.
Peter Heckmann: On customer budgets, can you talk a little bit more about, based on your analysis, who's being relatively more affected? Is it states, cities, counties? And how that's affecting some of their priorities for IT spending?
Lynn Moore: Yes, sure, Pete. It's a good question. And what we see is, as you know, about 80% of our business is at the local level city county, about 15% is at the state level and about 5% at the federal level. Going backwards from there, at the federal level, we're not really seeing any meaningful impact right now. We may see some delays, but those budgets seem to be intact. We are seeing some impact at the state level, when you look at our Tyler Federal division, which is really our MicroPact division. Their business is a mix -- pretty even mix between federal and state. And what we're seeing there is we're seeing some delays in RFPs. They're predominantly overwhelming at the state level, not the federal. At the city and county, it's still a little bit of a mixed bag. I think our clients are still grappling with the new budgets. I think they're still grappling with what type of stimulus funds may be available. And it's varying actually a little bit across our product suites. When you look at, for example, some of the leading indicators, RFPs and demos and execution of contracts. When you see things on our justice suite right now, our Courts & Justice solutions, our Public Safety solutions. Those are fairly on track right now for this year. We're expecting some pretty good sales. We've had -- obviously, we talked about Jacksonville, public safety. We expect some significant deals there. We're seeing a little bit more delays right now, I think, on the ERP side. But again, it's a little bit of a mixed bag right now.
Peter Heckmann: Okay. And that's helpful. And have you seen any indication that some of the smaller municipalities are looking at options of kind of banding together and jointly bidding out to vendors trying to get a volume discount across a number of smaller municipalities? Or is it still just you're basically negotiating with each municipality individually?
Lynn Moore: Yes. No, we're not really seeing small jurisdictions band together in that manner. So it's still kind of business as usual in that front.
Operator: The next question comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore. Please go ahead.
Kirk Materne: Hi, thanks very much. Lynn, I want to follow up on a comment you made at the end. Obviously, you all are in a good position relative to 10 years ago and relative to a lot of your competition, both in terms of sort of just the breadth of your portfolio and your financial -- sort of your balance sheet right now. What are -- is there anything you can do in this kind of environment to help your clients out from a -- like is pricing something that you can help them out with to try to take share in this kind of environment? Are you all going to remain maybe more on the offensive around M&A if something kind of falls into your lap? I'm just trying to get a sense on, is this an opportunity for you all to take market share just given your position in the market? And if there's anything you can really do to accelerate that potentially?
Lynn Moore: Well, I think the investments we've been making across the board, particularly in cloud and modernizing our products, I think we're going to see that's becoming more and more important. We're not right now doing anything significantly with pricing. I think you're right. We are in a strong position. I would argue that today -- sitting here today, we're even in a much stronger position than we were three months ago at the last earnings call, even with our top-line revenues off a little bit. And our balance sheet is that much more stronger than it was three months ago or probably about another $200 million or so. We're three months further along in all of our R&D initiatives, including modernizing all our core apps and sort of, as I mentioned in our comments, we've learned a lot -- we're learning a lot of things about ourselves in how we do business. And so we know too when we emerge, we're going to be even more efficient. So I think those are all opportunities. Looking at M&A, as you remember, really last year, we had talked about -- we've done so many acquisitions in 2018 and wrapping into early 2019, we've sort of taken a bit of a deliberate pause. I'd say right now, we're back in the same mode that we've historically been. I've actually -- we've looked at a handful of deals over the last six, eight weeks, and I anticipate that we'll continue to look at deals. And I think those are some opportunities out there. We do have a balance sheet that we can use to our favor, to our competitive advantage, both internally with these investments, but also looking at potential M&A deals throughout the rest of the year and into next year.
Kirk Materne: Okay. And I realize visibility is challenging right now, but -- and not to get too nuanced on this, but is the challenge really just understanding what's at the top of the funnel? Or how things are progressing sort of through the funnel? Meaning, are the discussions out there still happening? It's just difficult to see how they're going to sort of translate from opportunities into bookings. I know it's sort of a little bit of a nuanced question, but I'm just kind of -- like the opportunity for you all seems to be pretty massive. I just want to make sure I understand whether or not -- is that -- are people not even talking anymore? Or is it more like, hey, we need to do this. It's just -- I don't know when I'm going to get the funding to actually buy your technology?
Lynn Moore: Yes. I'd say my answer is that it's mostly sort of as it's working through the funnel right now. I think I would sort of remind you back to the comments of last quarter. If you recall, before COVID hit, the market was really pretty robust. We were off to a really great start, which was a sign of what the entire pipeline was. And actually, we were on pace to beat our internal plan for Q1, which is usually a pretty good indicator of how we'll do for the rest of the year. That pipeline, it doesn't go away, as you know. I mean everything we do is essential, that demand is there. And so you got to kind of think back, okay, where was the market ahead of time? That market is going to stay. And then also in the interim, the normal pipeline is going to continue to grow, it's just going to be pushed out a little bit. And I do think our clients are still wrestling with that question a little bit. There is a little uncertainty, there's a little apprehension. Anecdotally, we're hearing some things from some of our salespeople. Clients are saying, we sort of still need to see what budgets are looking like. We feel pretty confident that Feds are going to provide some more stimulus funding, but it just hasn't happened yet. Even within climate -- within jurisdictions, there's funds there. Obviously, our maintenance and subscriptions are not being canceled. Those are still there. But the -- moving forward with new projects, there's a little politics going on as who's going to get what funds and when. And so just a little apprehension and uncertainty right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt VanVliet of BTIG. Please go ahead.
Matt VanVliet: Hello. Thanks guys. Good morning. Appreciate for taking the questions. I guess digging in a little bit more, you talked about ERP being a little bit slower, but some of the other areas that are maybe viewed as more critical, but need to have some sort of upgrade in technology like Courts & Justice. Maybe digging in a little bit more on some of the other areas, whether that's a little bit more on the civic planning side? Are you seeing any traction in municipalities wanting to get some of those revenue-generating capabilities back if construction can pick up and people are a little bit more back at work? And then also on the school systems, as they're all planning on what it might look like or taking a dual-track process in terms of what the fall might look like, are you having more conversations around potential to make purchases there?
Lynn Moore: Yes, Matt, it's a good question. And I would say right now that we're only a couple -- it's just a couple of months. And so I would take some of my comments as much anecdotal as anything. I don't know that there's anything that's established a firm trend right now. We're just seeing what deals we believe are going to continue to go forward and close, and we're certainly seeing that with some public safety and courts deals. As we saw back in the Great Recession, which I think we kind of lean on for a little bit of experience, we talked about how we're replacing end of life, we talked about how this is essential. And in some cases, it's okay, where exactly are they in an end of life, and can they squeeze 1 more year out of this financial system? Or can they squeeze 1 more year, two more years? And they may be in a position to sort of doing some of that. I think your comments are stud about our civic services and permitting, licensing and planning. A couple of the deals I mentioned in my comments were some of our larger deals in the quarter. And I think the pipeline and outlook there still looks pretty good. With respect to schools, that's certainly an area of some uncertainty right now in a lot of facets, right? I mean a lot of schools haven't even made up the decision as to how they're going to operate next year, whether or not they're going to bring kids back or not, which obviously creates ripple effects, not just in our business, but through all our kids' lives and our employees' lives and those around the country. So I'd say there's a little bit of uncertainty still there around schools. One of the things that we've done to your comment about civic services and recovery is our Data & Insights division is really working closely with our Munis ERP solution and with our EnerGov Civic Services solution. We're coming out with some products. They've come out this quarter. We've got a few clients who are piloting them right now. On the ERP side, we call them Executive Insights, and on the EnerGov side, civic services, we're calling them community development insights. And it's -- these are -- this is Data & Insights. It's our Socrata platform. It's built on top of Munis for the executive insights, providing real-time financial fiscal health metrics like budgets, cash balances, HR metrics, payroll revenue versus budget, certain areas, property revenues versus budget. And certainly on the community development insights, it's helping them sort of understand the economic health and recovery, what's going on? Is it's -- it's pulling up real-time data on permits issued, permit applications, inspections, the value of permit construction that's going on. So these, I think, are pretty valuable tools. They're -- like I said, we've got 4 early adopters right now, a lot of positive feedback. And I think once we sort of get those solidified, you're going to let us roll that out. And that's just an example of us leveraging some of the investments we made before in Data & Insights, where I think there's a big future here and applying it right now to specific needs of our clients.
Matt VanVliet: Great. That's very helpful. And then following up on some of the free cash flow strength, in particular, around a lack of travel and maybe broader T&E-type of expenses and even commissions. But are you guys taking a look at what -- where you're at in terms of on plan or meeting quotas for salespeople? Are you looking to reset those at all to bring down those numbers to try to hit a certain percentage on quota? Should we expect maybe a little bit more of a payout in the back half if bookings can pick up a little bit? Just curious overall, kind of what the planning is around that to keep your salespeople happy, but understanding that maybe original numbers might not get hit?
Lynn Moore: Yes, it's a fair question. I think at a broad level, when you're looking at expenses and our operating margins for the rest of the year, I mean we kind of outlined that on our guidance, and we're expecting a lot of the things that are -- that we've seen over the last few months to continue on. We're evaluating. And we've done some things with our salespeople, and we'll continue to evaluate that. It's interesting. When we had this conversation three months ago, I think everybody, including us, thought the world would probably be in a little bit different place right now. And I think that's one reason we pulled down our guidance as there was so much uncertainty in around travel and things like that. And so as we're starting to see that this is going to continue on a little bit longer than probably even my expectation, certainly to the degree a few months ago, we're going to continue to look at that stuff internally.
Operator: The next question comes from Alex Zukin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Scott Wilson: Yes. Hi, Lynn. Hi, Brian. It's Scott Wilson on for Alex today. I guess, first question, just to level set the guide. Last quarter, the message was that you were confident in mid-single-digit growth. The reinstated guide is now at 4%, which is a little bit below where we were modeling. I guess with that in mind, you kind of hit on some of these things, but just to kind of be clear, what are the things that you're more confident in relative to 90 days ago? And what are the areas where you're less confident relative to 90 days ago?
Lynn Moore: Well, I'll start, and Brian, why don't you jump in? I think 90 days ago, we were generally under the assumption that local jurisdictions, I mean, just in general, your daily lives, but also what's going on with our clients that really, as we got into the third quarter, we'd start seeing a little bit more return to normal that people would be traveling, our ProServe's team would be on-site delivering services. Our appraisal services would be ramping up, that we would be starting to see more sales -- more in-person sales demos. And I think we just sort of -- I don't say we missed the boat, but it's -- things have continued to evolve. So I think that's an area that I think we sort of really didn't get a good feel for. I'm not sure three months ago; we had a really good feel for some of the operating expense savings that we would have throughout the rest of the year. It's certainly been a learning experience. One of the things we talk about as a management team constantly is something that successful companies do is they're constantly looking internally. They're constantly looking at ways to improve. Companies striving to do better. And what we've been able to do over the last few months is really take a hard look at some of our historical business practices, whether it's that on-site delivery of services, whether it's internal Tyler travel, whether it's the number of Trade Shows we do as well as the way we position some of our products we talked about Virtual Court. So this is a learning experience. It's a good one. And I think it's something that's going to help us emerge on the back end. Brian?
Brian Miller: Yes. I think -- so I think if you look just at the change really from basically our soft guidance of mid- single-digit growth, the biggest change is to what we've actually implemented in the current guidance is around -- on the revenue side around billable travel that we did expect we'd see more of that come back as we got into the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. And now we've eliminated most of that from the plan for the remainder of the year. So the midpoint of our guidance now is 4% growth, and so it's still kind of in that mid-single digits. But that's the biggest downside. Now those revenues are basically no margin revenues. So the effect is positive on our margins. Probably the things we're more confident in as well would be somewhat around the pipeline for the second half of the year. Obviously, we're three months closer to that, the deals that in our plans are pretty far along in the pipeline. We have better visibility into and better information around that. And as Lynn mentioned, the expense savings, we -- now with a quarter -- a full quarter behind us in this environment, we have a better feel for where those savings are happening and the volume of those.
Scott Wilson: That makes sense. And then just a follow-up. When looking at kind of your SaaS ARR specifically this quarter, it actually looked pretty strong to me. I mean it was up 8% sequentially, 22% year-over-year, not that different than this time last year. So I guess with that in mind and contrasting your license revenues down 18%, were you a little surprised at the strength in the quarter? And then like with that in mind, is COVID potentially accelerating the shift to SaaS at a greater rate than even your strategy that kind of was focused on pricing and sales incentives to kind of incent that shift? Is that happening? Out of curiosity.
Brian Miller: I do think that COVID is partially responsible for accelerating clients' desire to shift to the cloud and notwithstanding that we -- that our larger deals this quarter were mostly on the license side. But we did see some license deals and some SaaS deals, but more license deals slide out of the quarter, which resulted in that bigger decline in our license revenues. Yes, but the ARR growth this quarter on the revenue side, a lot of that represents deals we signed in prior quarters that are now coming online. For example, we've started recognizing revenues even in the North Carolina, e-warrants contract we signed last quarter. We're continuing to ramp up with the North Carolina court system and expand revenues there. So those prior bookings feed into the actual revenue recognition growth over time. And so we're benefiting from that. But we do think that this environment will continue to accelerate clients' desire to be in the cloud, which certainly, long-term, is a good thing and consistent with our desire to move more of our business to the cloud and where a lot of our investments are coming in today.
Operator: The next question comes from Rob Oliver of Baird. Please go ahead.
Rob Oliver: Great. Thank you guys. Yes, a follow-up to that last question. Lynn, since you took over, you've been kind of moving, I think, your sales team more towards a cloud subscription focus, and that's bearing fruit. And I guess when you look back at previous downturns, customers were faced with a really expensive perpetual license renewal. And I'm just wondering, I know you said in your prepared remarks that subscription was also impacted this quarter, and that makes sense. But wondering to what extent as you guys work with your customers, you are leading more with that subscription side as it seems like it might be a much more palatable entry point for customers looking to do things with you guys? And then I have a follow-up.
Lynn Moore: Yes, I think that's right, Rob. I think as their budget pressures in public sector, people are going to be looking to do things that are more and more efficient and investing in large infrastructure and large IT shops, I think, is not going to be the way. It's going to go. And we have been moving more, I would call right now into what we call a cloud-preferred approach, historically, it was cloud agnostic. And so we're doing things with our salespeople. We're trying to get out that message of ROI, trying to get the message of security of the cloud. And I think you're starting to see that in our new sales. I think also what's interesting is, we talked about it -- I talked about a little bit in our prepared remarks, but is the SaaS flips that are going on within Tyler, those are continuing to gain traction. And I'd say, historically, if you look back a few years ago, most of the SaaS flips were really occurring on the ERP side. Really beginning last year, we started putting more internal focus, for example, in our Appraisal & Tax division on SaaS flip. We started to get the message out to our customers that the cloud is going to be the future. And that message is being well received. We're also starting to see it really in our Courts & Justice side. It's a focus of theirs this year. They've done some things, really looked at their pricing, as you know. They've got some very small clients up to some very large state-wide clients. And they've done some things with some tiered pricing and stuff, so they can start rolling that out. And it's showing in the numbers. I think we talked about 42 SaaS flips, but some of the more significant SaaS flips we had this year, you look at appraisal and tax, it was Franklin County, Ohio, it was Cab, Georgia. At C&J, it was Oasis County, Texas, which is Corpus Christi and Alameda County in California, which is our CaseloadPRO solution. So the focus, not only just on new sales, but also going back into our installed base with SaaS flips is something that's continuing to gain traction with us, and it's going to be a focus in the near future.
Rob Oliver: That's really helpful. And I just had one follow-up. Just on the New World Public Safety side, it's nice wins this quarter. And I know the win rates have continued to improve for you guys there. And it may be early to tell, I know it's sort of Q4-heavy, but anything that you guys are hearing from your customers relative to budgets. And I guess I'm particularly interested in what municipalities are thinking relative to their ability to spend amidst current protests and the environment that we're in, considering police funding and things like that?
Lynn Moore: Yes, sure. I think there's some really -- we've talked about a lot over the last several -- the last couple of years. I mean we've made a lot of investments in public safety that are really starting to pay off. Those investments were done to modernize the apps, but really to expand the TAM, and the Jacksonville contract is really a strategic win for them. As I mentioned, it's a full suite, including e-records, field reporting, SoftCode, Brazos, SceneDoc, Socrata. That win validates not only our investments we've been making in public safety and moving up market. But it also validates the acquisitions that we've been doing over the last several years. As I noted, is as I reel those off, SoftCode, Brazos, SceneDoc, Socrata, those are all recent acquisitions and things that we've done to enhance our offerings. And you're never quite sure what is the tipping point in the deal, but certainly, those helped round out a deal and help us move upstream. So those are continuing to pay off. As you look at budgets in public safety, as I mentioned earlier, that was a very large contract for us. We've got some significant opportunities that we think are still going to close this year. There's a lot of attention right now on defunding the police and what does that mean and what does it not mean? And that concept has kind of been around for a long time, probably going back to the civil rights days of the '60s. And I think it's not quite clear what that means for some. Is it -- are you talking about defunding? Are you talking about reforming? It's really talked about at some of the Tier 1 cities. But at the end of the day, public safety is going to be funded. Public safety is very important. I'm not sure that across the nation, despite what you see on television that there's some overwhelming push that there's going to be a defunding of police departments across the country. I think if anything, it probably puts a greater emphasis on technology, it puts a greater emphasis on some of the investments that we've been making, things like mobility and things -- I think a greater emphasis on data and insights and transparency and the things we're doing with Socrata integrating with our Public Safety solution. And so it's -- at the end of the day, I just -- I think that public safety is funding is going to be there. What we see in the near-term and the pipeline is there. And I think we're in a great position given all the investments we've been making in the last couple of years.
Operator: The next question comes from Scott Berg of Needham & Company. Please go ahead.
Scott Berg: Hi, Lynn, congrats on a good quarter. A couple, I guess, quick ones for me. First of all, Brian, you had a nice expansion in operating margins, and you kind of highlighted the reasons for them, obviously, in the quarter, less travel, et cetera, less sales commissions. But operating margins have compressed a little bit over the last two to three years, mainly as you've invested more in product, you've obviously made a couple of acquisitions that had some lower-margin structures. But is this new level -- or the operating margins in the second quarter, is this kind of a sustainable level, do you think going forward with some of the changes you and Lynn highlighted to maybe service delivery, et cetera? Or you think that operating margins could maybe revert back to where they've been over the last 12 to 18 months as we come through this?
Brian Miller: I think it's probably somewhere in between. Some of these things that are affecting our margins are fairly onetime or temporary situations. For example, our lower health claims costs around -- because people haven't been having elective procedures or going in for their physicals. That will come back. Some of the trade shows likely will come back. But in the long term, I think we're learning we can do virtual trade shows and learning some about the value of some of those things that we've done in the past and that some of them won't, company T&E. We just had very effective quarterly management meeting virtually, and we probably won't go back to having 4 of those in person afterwards. When you multiply those across the company, I think a lot of those will have permanent positive impacts on margins and efficiency, and there will be some of those that will come back. I think the biggest thing is probably around how we deliver services. And that's something we've talked about, pre-COVID, is doing that much more effectively. We have little to no margin on a lot of our professional services. We do them to control the quality of our engagements and have successful implementations that we can control, but don't make much money on that. And so this has certainly proven that we can do that effectively -- a large portion of that remotely. And that our clients who might have previously resisted that are willing to accept that. And so I think that will be one of the permanent changes. So I think there are some long-term margin improvements that will come out of this, and that's clearly a positive for us. So net, I do expect our margins will be better. But I think there's some reversion as some things come back. We do have -- and also, as we've said, we've really continued with our R&D. So a little bit of delays in hiring some people. But generally, we added quite a few R&D heads this quarter. And generally, we're going full steam ahead with our existing investment plans, and our R&D for the full year will be very close to what our plan was. So this margin expansion is even in the light of what was sort of our original plan for R&D.
Lynn Moore: Scott, if I could amplify on that, too. I agree with Brian about remote delivery of services, and it's something that clients are becoming more acceptant of that. It's not like next year or two years from now, we'll be 100% virtual delivery of services. That's just not -- that's probably not feasible. We'll do some things to help -- that is -- it's good to see clients accepting it. The fact that we're being successful with our go-lives is very important. We may do some pricing with either on-prem versus remote that will help. And then stepping back, I mean we talked earlier about it was a tough quarter for bookings because of last year. We're setting up a tough margin year for next year. And coming into the expectation, you're right, we have been investing heavily for a couple of years. And our expectation originally coming in the year was a little more flattish margins from the year before, and with margin pickup to start coming in 2021. So I would expect really going back to that baseline that we will have a pickup and perhaps a little bit more than we might have expected because of some of these sustainable savings, but still a little too early to tell exactly what that is.
Scott Berg: Great. Super helpful. And then a quick follow-up on, Lynn, your prior comments on customers that are moving towards your subscription solutions outside of your ERP customers, whether it's Public Safety, Courts & Justice, et cetera. Are those customers making the initial purchase decision still on a perpetual basis, and you're seeing more of those conversions to the cloud? Or are you actually seeing customers kind of net new upfront, selecting cloud from the get-go?
Lynn Moore: We're seeing net new. It's been in our Courts & Justice space. We've been seeing more in the cloud. We're seeing it more on the A&T side, same with EnerGov and things like that. But we're also -- really, the point of my comment was the focus was to outline our focus on internally on flips across a broader spectrum of our products. And so it's just part of our overall long-term initiative of moving to the cloud and say it's starting to get some traction.
Operator: The next question comes from Charlie Strauzer of F -- I'm sorry -- CJS Securities. Please go ahead.
Charlie Strauzer: Hi, good morning. Just, Brian, for you, it's probably best view is on the guidance for the year. Just some additional commentary on how to think about the split between Q3 and Q4, just to help us kind of models a little bit better?
Brian Miller: Yes. And on the split, certainly, the timing has some uncertainty in it, as it always does. Bookings can be lumpy, particularly on the license side. We typically have a bigger license quarter in Q4 around public safety. So I'd expect that we would see sequential revenue growth in each of Q3 and Q4. And I mean I think the growth in each of those quarters is probably fairly consistent after -- so the number you need to get to, to get to that over -- the annual guidance number is probably pretty consistent between Q3 and Q4 in terms of a growth rate. And the earnings, we would expect to grow sequentially in Q3 and then again in Q4 as well. So sequential revenue growth, sequential earnings growth, but exactly where that split falls out is a little hard to tell. I mean I think the guidance implies something around 5% growth for the second half of the year. And that will likely be fairly consistent in both Q3 and Q4.
Charlie Strauzer: Got it. That's helpful. And then just looking at the pipeline, you talked about a lot about the pipeline so far. But if you are seeing new RFPs coming to the pipeline, what areas are those coming in? And are you seeing some RFPs that are maybe leading to new product development ideas for your R&D team?
Lynn Moore: Well, there are still some new RFPs. But I would say that's just the volume is -- across is not as robust in certain areas as others, as I mentioned earlier. And this is really sort of looking out over the next 6, 9 months. And like I said in our -- mentioned earlier in my comments, we're seeing things at the Tyler federal level in the Justice solutions, those leading indicators, RFPs are holding fairly steady. Same with our Data & Insights solution. They're off a little bit right now in some of our ERP solutions. But again, to my comments before, it's -- this is all timing. These decisions don't go away. They just get delayed.
Operator: The next question comes from Jonathan Ho of William Blair & Company. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Ho: Hi, good morning. I just wanted to start out with the virtual courts opportunity that you talked about. Can you give us maybe a sense of what that could look like? I know you're offering it for free in the beginning, but could this be an add-on module? Like can you talk a little bit about pricing or uplift as you kind of build out that capability?
Brian Miller: Sure. It is -- once it gets out of the free trial basis, it is an add-on. It's a cloud offering, hosted at AWS. So it's a subscription add-on to the existing base. This is primarily -- today, with our municipal courts customers, which are less complex type courts, traffic courts and those sorts of things, many of them with smaller customers. So the individual uplift is sort of moderate, I'd say, compared to their existing recurring revenues with us. But it's certainly something we think is very broad applicability across our municipal court base. And also we're looking at expanding a similar offering into our larger Odyssey customer base. So I don't really -- I think, I'm not really in a position to quantify the opportunity, but it's -- I'd say it's a meaningful uplift from the existing recurring revenues with those customers.
Jonathan Ho: Got it. And then in terms of your ability to sell add-on capabilities and incremental offerings versus, I guess, the larger systems. I mean clearly, you're seeing delays in the bigger procurements. But is there an opportunity to maybe circle back to existing customers to upsell additional modules as you think about, I guess, pivoting in the current environment?
Lynn Moore: Yes, I think that's a good point, Jonathan. And the answer -- the short answer is yes. And we're actually seeing that. Our Insight sales across the board is holding fairly steady right now. And so I do think that's an opportunity, not just in this environment, but I actually think it's one of our larger opportunities as a company as we continue to move forward.
Operator: The next question comes from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.
Keith Housum: Good morning guys. A question for you on the guidance. How important is the, I guess, the federal relief if it comes through? And what kind of impact would it have on your guidance if we do or do not get federal guidance for the rest of the year? I'm sorry, not federal guidance, but federal relief from the government.
Lynn Moore: Yes. I wouldn't expect it to have a meaningful impact for the rest of this year. And I think it will start having more of an impact as we get into 2021, and particularly as this budget cycle sort of -- we sort of run through this budget cycle. I mean it's one thing too for the Feds to go ahead and announce some significant stimulus. We've seen that already with some of the things they've done in response to COVID. It's another thing for the jurisdictions to get their applications in and get the funding and all of that stuff. So it's an important piece. I think it helps with some of their just general uncertainty right now and anxiety, but I wouldn't expect it to have a meaningful impact in 2020.
Brian Miller: Yes, most deals that are going to close in the next 2 quarters are pretty far along in the pipeline that worked through lengthy sales processes already. And those generally are already funded in an existing budget and also generally are very high priorities in terms of the needs. So those, we expect to be largely unaffected to the extent we see delays around those. It's less around funding and more around just the logistics and the disruption that the clients are having that has slowed down some of the processes and might push them out of this quarter into next quarter and more of the short-term kinds of delays.
Keith Housum: Got you. That's helpful. And then as I think about like almost your business like e-filings and appraisals, is there an opportunity here for pent-up demand? And once hopefully we get through the COVID issue by the end of the year or soon after, is there an opportunity for, I guess, more e-filing transactions to come through -- revenue to come through? Is that pent-up demand has worked through? Or is this pretty much more just delayed it kept -- keeps the can being kicked down the road further?
Lynn Moore: No, I think there's -- well, I don't know that we can say for certainty, but we believe that there will be an opportunity potentially for a bump in e-filing. E-filing is obviously challenged right now, even though some courts have opened, a significant percentage of current e-filings, current civil filings are really debt-related, they're landlord eviction-related. And right now, there's kind of -- there's moratoriums on that even where courts are open. Some of those cases, they won't go away. So we do think there's a possibility for pent-up demand, but I don't know that we've got real certainty around that right now.
Brian Miller: And about 75% of our e-filing is on a fixed fee basis and 25% is transactional and variables. So it's a minority of our business on the e-filing side is affected today. But some of those places where the courts are shut down, we've seen that to be significant.
Operator: At this time, there appears to be no more questions. I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Moore for closing remarks.
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Danielle, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We certainly hope you all stay safe and healthy. And if you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Brian Miller or myself. Thanks.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Please, you may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-04-30 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to today's Tyler Technologies First Quarter 2020 Conference Call. Your host for today's call is John Marr, Chairman of Tyler Technologies. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session and instruction will follow at that time. And as a reminder this conference is being recorded today, April 30, 2020. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Marr. Please go ahead.
John Marr: Thank you, Brent, and welcome to our first quarter 2020 earnings call. With me on the call today are Lynn Moore, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like for Brian to give the safe harbor statement. Next, Lynn will have some preliminary comments, and Brian will review the details of the first quarter results. This will be followed by a discussion of the impact and our responses related to the COVID-19 pandemic. And I'll have some final comments and we'll take your questions.
Brian Miller : Thanks, John. During the course of this conference call management may make statements that provide information other than historical information and may include projections concerning the company's future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks.  Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Lynn?
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. We got a very solid first quarter with a great deal of momentum going into the second half of March, when we began to see the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The market was active and we executed at a high level. This was our 34 consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. As GAAP revenues grew 11.9% and non-GAAP revenues grew 11.3%. Organic revenue growth was 6.4% for GAAP revenues, and 5.7% for non-GAAP revenues. Our core software revenues from licenses and subscriptions grew 12.1% on a non-GAAP basis, with 8.3% organic growth. We continue to experience an increasing preference among clients for cloud offerings, as subscription arrangements represented 73% of new contract value signed this quarter. Of course, this was pressure on short-term revenue growth, but generates higher revenues and margins over the long-term. GAAP subscription revenues grew 21.5% and non-GAAP subscription revenues grew 20.5%. Subscription revenue growth has now exceeded 20% for 11 consecutive quarters and 52 of the last 57 quarters. Total recurring revenues from maintenance and subscriptions grew 17.1% on a GAAP basis, and comprised approximately 71% of total revenues. It was another extremely strong quarter for bookings, which were up 39.8%, our second consecutive quarter of greater than 30% bookings growth. Our two largest SaaS deals in the quarter led the way, both we're following contracts with the state of North Carolina Administrative Office of the Courts. The first was for our new Odyssey e-warrant solution and was valued at approximately $24 million. The second contract, which we noted on our last earnings call, was for our Brazos e-citation solution, valued at approximately $14.5 million. Both of these 10 year SaaS agreements expand on the relationship with North Carolina that started with our largest SaaS agreement ever, an $85 million contract signed last June for Odyssey case management in e-filling solutions. And demonstrate our ability to grow our client relationships across our broad portfolio of integrated solutions. We signed two other SaaS deals in the quarter that each had a contract value of greater than $6 million. One with DuPage County, Illinois, for our IS World Appraisal solution, and one with the city of Richardson, Texas, where multi suite arrangement for our Munis ERP, ExecuTime, time and attendance and EnerGov Civic Services, Incode Courts and Socrata Data Insights Solutions takes full advantage of our connected communities vision. We also signed five new SaaS arrangements with contract values greater than $3 million. Four of those deals, were for our Munis ERP solution with the cities of Merced, Napa and Palm Springs, all in California, as well as Napa County, California. The fifth was with the South Carolina Department of Education for the first statewide implementation of our Versatrans school transportation solution. Our largest on-premises license deal of the quarter was a $6.3 million contract with Beaver County, Pennsylvania for our IS World Appraisal solution, which also included appraisal services. We continue to widen our market share lead in the California Court Case Management market with a $4.4 million on-premises license contract with Contra Costa County for Odyssey Solution. We also signed a $2.7 million license arrangement with L.A. County for EnerGov Civic Services solution. Now I'd like to Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter, and then we'll move to discussion of COVID-19.
Brian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2020. In our earnings release, we've included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results in comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the investor relations section of our website under the financial reports tab schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. GAAP revenues for the first quarter were $276.5 million, up 11.9%. On a non-GAAP basis, revenues were $276.8 million, up 11.3%. Organic revenue growth was 6.4% on a GAAP basis and 5.7% on a non-GAAP basis. Our core software license and subscription revenues combined grew organically 8.3% on non-GAAP basis. Subscription revenues for the quarter increased 21.5%. We added 131 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 19 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $101 million in total contract value. In Q1 of last year, we added 128 new subscription-based arrangements and had 13 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $49 million in total contract value. Subscription contract value comprise approximately 73% of new -- total new software contracts value signed this quarter compared to 54% in Q1 last year. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 5.9 years, compared to 4.1 years in Q1 last year, with the increase caused by the two large 10 year contracts with the state of North Carolina mentioned earlier. Revenues from e-filing and online payments which are included in subscriptions increased 14.7% to $22 million. That amount includes e-filing revenue of $14.9 million up to 1.7% over last year, and e-payments revenue of $7.1 million up 56.7%. For the first quarter, our annualized non-GAAP total recurring revenue or ARR was $785 million up 16.2%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS arrangements for Q1 was approximately $239 million, up 22.8%, transaction based ARR was approximately $88 million up 14.7% and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was approximately $458 million up 13.3%. Our backlog at the end of the quarter reached a new high of $1.5 billion up 19.2%, backlog included $369 million of maintenance compared to $353 million a year ago. Subscription backlog was $668 million compared to $489 million last year, and includes approximately $128 million related to fixed fee e-filing contracts. Including our e-filing contract with the state of Texas, which was extended for one year through August of 2022 during the quarter.  As Lynn noted, our bookings were very strong again this quarter at approximately $319 million, an increase of 39.8% from Q1 of last year. But the trailing 12 months bookings were approximately $1.4 billion, up 37%.  Our software subscription bookings in the quarter added $12.6 million in new annual recurring revenue up 10.7% over last year's $11.4 million. For comparison it's all of our new subscription contracts have been under licensed arrangements, we estimated that they would have represented additional license revenue of approximate $20 million. As a reminder, our bookings comparison in the second quarter will be a very tough one, irrespective of the impact of COVID-19. Last year's second quarter bookings were record $452 million an included our largest contract in history, the $85 million SaaS contract for the North Carolina Courts, as well as the $20 million SaaS contract with Bear County, Texas Courts. Cash flow from operations more than doubled to $56.7 million and free cash flow quadrupled to $46 million, primarily due to strong collection of receivables. During the quarter, we repurchase 58,804 shares of our stock for a total of $15.5 million, or an average of approximately $263 per share. We ended the quarter with $393 million in cash and investments and no outstanding debt. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn for the discussion on the impact of and our responses to the COVID-19 pandemics. Lynn?
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and its effect on the economy, I want to share information on how Tyler Technologies approaching this challenge and its impact on our business. First, our operational response. Tyler's nearly 5500 team members continue to provide a high standard of client service with mi nimal disruption. Our primary focus has been on ensuring that our employees and their families are safe and healthy, while supporting clients who provide essential services to the public. Most of our offices already had many staff members who normal workdays involve remote work environments. Beginning in mid-March, we transition quickly to work from home for all of our staff. Equipping our employees to continue their work uninterrupted and also curtail travel for our employees. Our clients face increasing disruption to their operations, as they dealt with the effects of the pandemic on their communities, and focused on providing vital services to their citizens. In March, we began seeing delays in some procurement processes, and finalizing some existing contract awards became logistically more difficult. Some implementation appraisal service projects were also delayed, as clients were grappling with balancing local shelter in place and social distance orders while conducting daily operations. Trade shows where large numbers of vendors and prospective clients gather in person were scheduled or rescheduled or canceled. We are addressing the challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic by adapting the way we do business, using web and video conferencing extensively for collaboration, conducting sales demos, providing client support and delivering professional services such as training remotely, and even executing complex go lives virtually. With the spread of COVID-19, our clients need for digital connectedness both within the organization and directly with the public is rapidly shifting from a vision to an urgent requirement. In recent weeks, we've seen many examples of our team members working with our clients to adapt to the current environment in truly inspiring ways. I'd like to highlight a few examples. San Bernardino County, California, pulled off a completely virtual go-live of our Odyssey court case management system by pivoting to our remote command center model. The go-live would ordinarily have involved a number of Tyler team members travelling to be on site. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we accelerated the launch of our new virtual core solution and we are offering it without charge for 90 days, in order to help court client serve their constituents without interruption. Since the official launch last month, more than 16 courts have selected this solution to handle cases remotely, removing the burden of having defendants physically appear in a courtroom, while also broadening access to justice for disadvantaged or displaced defendants. The New York State Division of Veterans Affairs deployed our Entellitrak solution in under a week. So it’s staff to continue to approve claims remotely, ensuring that veterans in the state will continue to have access to benefits. Numerous law enforcement agencies optimize their new world computer aided dispatch tools to flag calls for service or someone might be a COVID-19 carrier, allowing officers to take necessary precautions. School districts are using Tyler Traversa Ride 360 app temporarily offered free of charge to assist with parent communications during the crisis, and are using our school bus routing software to plan meal deliveries to families in need. The Superior Court of San Luis Obispo California worked with Tyler teams over a single weekend to customize its Odyssey guide and file solution. So domestic violence complaints to be filed online while shelter in place orders are in effect. Numerous cities are using our MyCivic app to provide up to the date COVID-19 information to residents. I couldn't be prouder of how our dedicated professionals have embraced the challenge and are selling it meeting the needs of our clients. I'm constantly inspired by the spirit, resilience and compassion shown by our team members. With that backdrop, I'd like to make a few general comments about the financial impact of the pandemic on the quarter and the rest of 2020. As well as provide some thoughts on the long-term outlook and prospects for Tyler. Well, not material, the pandemic and response by clients and prospects did affect first quarter results. As I mentioned previously, a few sales pushed out in the first quarter, and professional services revenues, including global travel were also negatively impacted. We also canceled our annual user conference, Tyler Connect, which was scheduled to be held this week in Orlando. The costs associated with that cancellation, approximately $727,000 are included in our first quarter results. We estimate that the total revenue impact of COVID-19 in the first quarter was approximately $6 million. As we look out over the rest of 2020, we anticipate a greater impact from COVID-19 in the second and third quarters. While we have not seen meaningful cancellations, we continue to see delays in procurement processes and lengthening sales cycles, as public sector entities focus on issues related to pandemic. Although the Cares Act provided approximately 424 billion in economic aid to state and local governments, and additional stimulus packages are expected to provide more assistance. Many of our clients will face near term budget pressures. We can deliver the majority of our professional services remotely, but we expect to see lower services revenues as some projects are delayed by client availability. In addition, a number of courts have limited operations during the pandemic, which will impact transaction based e-filing revenues during this period.  In addition to these core revenues, approximately $6 million of revenues classified as hardware and other revenues will be eliminated in the second quarter as a result of the cancellation of our Connect conference. Billable travel will also be impacted significantly in the second quarter, but should return a safe begin to transition back from shelter in place to more normal operations.  While some of these variable revenue streams will continue to be impacted by the current environment, we anticipate that recurring revenues, which comprise approximately 70% of our total revenues will not be significantly affected. We expect to continue to invest in product development and accelerating our move to the cloud at levels consistent with our initial plans for the year.  We value the experience and expertise of our employees and do not expect to eliminate any positions, but anticipate the incremental hiring will be reduced somewhat from our original plans. We also expect to see reductions in some expenses, including travel and entertainment, trade shows and health claims.  As we remain confident in our long-term outlook, there are significant short-term uncertainties around the continuously evolving COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our operations and those of our clients. For example, government response to the pandemic will continue to vary significantly from state-to-state, and even from jurisdiction-to-jurisdiction within a state, thereby making the duration and scope of business restrictions within the public sector difficult to predict.  As a result, we are suspending our guidance until such time as we have more clarity around the ultimate severity, duration and impact of the pandemic. I expect to have more clarity on the impact of COVID-19 to our 2020 financial performance during our second quarter earnings call.  While our near-term outlook remains clouded by some uncertainty, given our high percentage of recurring revenues, it's my current expectation that Tyler revenues will still grow in the mid single-digits during 2020 with relatively flat operating margins compared to last year.  As I look out beyond the uncertainties created by the pandemic, I am as confident as ever in Tyler's long-term outlook and prospects. Tyler's fundamentals have never been stronger. Tyler has endured trying times in the past, including Y2K and the dot-com bust, 911 in the great recession. Each time, we emerged as a stronger company with an improved competitive position.  Unlike certain industries, the pandemic has not changed the underlying fundamentals and long-term demand for our software and services. Tyler exclusively serves the public sector, including local, state and federal government. Our clients will not go out of business, and the solutions we provide are essential, whether managing revenue to keep communities operating, ensuring public safety to help the most vulnerable, or providing transparency and access to government for the residents of the jurisdictions they serve.  Our software manages mission critical functions, such as 911, dispatch, courts, property taxes, utilities and payroll. Often our clients are acquiring solutions to replace aging systems that are end of life and may be unreliable or unsupported. Replacing those essential services is generally a high priority, regardless of the economic environment.  If anything, the current crisis is already highlighting the reliance on outdated technology by large segments of the public sector. You likely have seen recent news around issues related some of these decades-old COBOL based systems.  Long-term opportunities will emerge from this crisis as both Tyler and our clients we examine historical business practices. For example, work from home postures further highlight the need and benefits of connectivity and cloud services, something we've been actively investing in and are continuing with our strategic collaboration with AWS. Clients will continue to appreciate the value of data and being connected with others, with other departments and jurisdictions as well as its citizens. This is our connected communities vision, a vision that only Tyler can execute. Clients may become more willing to accept remote delivery of services, something they've been more reluctant to do in the past. Doing so makes our employees even more productive and efficient. And our ability to deliver uninterrupted, high quality support during these uncertaintimes, only further strengthens our bonds with clients and reinforces Tyler's messages of both agility and stability. As I mentioned earlier, Tyler has endured challenging times in the past and emerged stronger than before. Today, we believe, we are even better positioned to whether an economic slowdown. Recurring revenues comprise approximately 70% of our total, including newer transaction based revenue streams, like e-filing online payments. Our competitive position and win rates are stronger than ever. And we've significantly expanded our total addressable market through investments in a combination of M&A and Research and Development. And technology is increasingly critical factor in helping government function effectively, especially in difficult times. Our financial position is also the strongest it's ever been, with zero debt, nearly $400 million in cash and investments and substantial additional liquidity available through our $400 million undrawn credit facility, which can be further expanded through an accordion feature. As a result, we're able to continue to invest at a high level in all of our long-term strategic initiatives, something that companies with highly leveraged balance sheets or start-ups lacking the stability of highly recurring revenue base may not be able to do. Our ability to actively invest during the great recession was one of the key differentiators that strengthen our overall market position, when demand inevitably returned. We will continue to do the same during this crisis. We recognize this as an evolving situation. Tyler is fortunate to have a deep and broad base of knowledge and domain expertise across our employee group, which is approaching the situation with compassion and good humour. I am confident, we will see our way through these unusual circumstances with a spirit of cooperation, integrity and service that has been the hallmark of our company from the beginning. I can't be more proud and excited to be part of Tyler than I am now. Now, I'd like to turn the call back to John for his comments.
John Marr: Thanks, Lynn and Brian. Obviously, a little different call and unusual and a lot of information to digest. Before we take your questions, I'd like to reinforce a few of the highlights. First, I want to add my recognition and appreciation to the entire Tyler team, as well to the strong leadership that Lynn and his executive team have provided. We deliver and support a lot of great technology. But the true value of Tyler exists in our 5500 incredible employees. These professionals are what differentiate Tyler from all other players in this space. Lynn and Brian provided a lot of data points in detail. I'll just add one of my own anecdotal observations. Nearly every day for the past month, and we drive through the parking lots of the two larger facilities here in Maine, where normally there would be 500 or 600 cars. I need to admit after seeing this company grow to this level over the past 20 years, it can be a little discouraging to see nearly completely empty parking lots. But then as I talk to our leadership team, I'm told that the dev and R&D projects are on schedule. Customer support issues are being handled and close was better than the normal response times. And go live continue to move forward. As Lynn has been saying it's not only impressive, it's inspiring. From early in the morning until literally midnight or past there, thousands of Tyler employees are tunneled into the network and cranking out the work. These people have lives, children, homeschooling, spouses working, some of them in the healthcare professions in their own commitments. One interesting fact is that the highest network activity is late at night. 8, 10, 12 o'clock. Literally hundreds, sometimes thousands are online getting the work done after the other challenges of the day have been satisfied.  It's incredible to witness, it's also gratifying to know that we have a business model strategy and we're in a position where these jobs are secure, and Tyler will only grow stronger. Yes, we will be impacted in the short and likely medium term. As you've heard, sales cycles will lengthen our ability to travel the customer sites will have an impact, and there will be some incremental pressure on government budgets at all levels. But the fundamentals that we are built on aren't changing. Everything we do is centered around essential enterprise applications. Our customers will survive and we're aligning technology even more to recover. They're still going to run payrolls, manage courts, dispatch first responders, appraise properties, and on and on. But now, there is some uncertainty. The Tyler will grow this year will be profitable, will strengthen our already strong balance sheet, and most importantly, will execute on all the key strategic and competitive initiatives. This simply won't be true for most of our competitors. Smaller startup types don't have the financial strength. Many of our competitors are peeking around and saddled with significant debt, limiting their investment flexibility. Other horizontal players, this isn't a first or highest priority, and they'll have to make difficult decisions. I'm not suggesting there won't be other good competitors on the other side of this thing. There always will be, but I'm certain that Tyler will be stronger on the other side. Whatever negative impact may occur over the next couple of quarters, it's just timing. If a decision or replacing system is delayed, that's all it is delayed. We saw this in the great recession with a slow year, year and a half and then a very robust recovery. It's a net zero game and when those deals come back online, I'm confident our win rates will only be higher.  Now Brent, we'll take questions
Operator: We will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Kirk Materne with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Kirk Materne: I guess maybe for Lynn or John. And John, you sort of refer to the great recession, I was kind of curious. Obviously your customer base is fairly unique, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I think a lot of the budget in process maybe happens over the course of this summer as new fiscal year budgets are set. So – when you think you have a little bit more maybe insight as to how project planning might get impacted by the uncertainty brought on by COVID. Is this something you might have a little bit more visibility on by the end of the summer, as budgets are set? Or is this something that it's frankly, just a totally open ended question mark at this point.
John Marr: It hard to know, Kirk. Some of the budget here are actually different around the country. Some people go out, do their due diligence, go through a selection process and then go to finance committees for funds, others get the money appropriated and know they have it and then execute the process. So it'll be a little bit all over the place. That's obviously why we suspend guidance. As we've said, 70% of our business is recurring, we don't see it to be affected in a meaningful way. A lot of the other 30 comes out of backlog and is pretty essential there has to occur. And so you end up with a small piece of our business that's important to us. But it's a little less predictable at this point in time, and we'll just kind of have to see how things unfold. As I've said, and what we experienced in the great recession was the deals that got pushed, they all occurred. Back then, we actually had a flat revenue year and we've negative $1 million, the only time it's ever happened. And then we had several very strong years following that. So it's really just a shift in the timing. If they need new systems, they simply need them and they will replace them. But I think the next few quarters will be hard to see, other than the practice in our case, they are on a small percentage of our business, that's a risk and the vast majority of it stays in place.
Kirk Materne: Yes, that'll make sense. And maybe just in terms of early still, early on is so fluid that just maybe in terms of your conversations with customers right now, in terms of maybe their propensity to think more about sort of subscription models in terms of, maybe some of the CapEx savings versus OpEx, I guess there's the state local governments sort of thinking that same way that a lot of the commercial companies who in terms of CapEx savings versus OpEx stand, and does that help or bring about I guess, maybe even faster transition towards subscription are always, I just curious how you guys think that's going to be?
John Marr: I think the bigger driver from this incident is just the availability of technology. So with everybody working from home, with the citizen and partner facing apps, applications, much of that's just much more reliable in the cloud. So, some of these people on legacy systems that are hosted in city halls, county offices, courthouses, it's been much more difficult for them to provide that kind of access in a reliable fashion in partnering with somebody that runs a modern technology, advanced cloud system, gives them far greater flexibility. So I think that will be the bigger driver to accelerate the movement of cloud.
Kirk Materne: Okay. Great. I'll turn it over to others. Thanks for your time. And stay safe.
Operator: Our next question will come from Scott Berg with Needham. Please go ahead.
Scott Berg: Hi, John, Lynn and thanks for taking questions. I guess first question was you talked about some of the similar fees in 2008 John, you just mentioned that expectation that deals back I mean, related component. But what the state about today versus 2008? You gave the guidance, and some uncertainties through the different commentaries interesting that due to the visibility of the business is a little bit different than 2008 or 2009. Is -- I guess is that, a, the right rate? And b, is there any other differences that you would call out today?
Lynn Moore: Scott, I think, obviously, one of the clearest examples of difference between '08, '09 and today is the speed and the shutdown. And the impact, as John mentioned earlier, back then, after coming out of the great recession, we had a year where we were essentially flat, maybe even a little down in revenues, but that wasn't until 2010. The impact on the economy was a little bit slower. Here we obviously have a much more forced, self imposed closure. So, I think the compression of the effects may be a little bit stronger.  So still hard to know. I do think, as we said earlier, our Q2 and Q3, we're going to learn a little bit more as we go into some more budget cycles. But I would say the speed of the compression and any associated lag, maybe a little shorter. Another difference for us personally, and one of the things that makes me even more positive today is the position that Tyler's in today versus where we were 12 years ago. We talked about our balance sheet, we talked about our cash position, go back to 2008, 2009, our balance sheet was a lot different story. We probably had somewhere around only 10 million in cash and probably around equal amount in debt. And today we're in different position. Our recurring revenues as a model, I think back then were less than half of our overall revenues. Today they're approaching 70%, 71%.  We've been investing back then one of our biggest initiatives was to invest during that time, we've been doing that leading up to that. So, a lot of investments we've been making are prime to the coming online and poised to take, really take position of where we are when we come out of this. So, at a high level, that's what I'd say the difference. There certainly are some similarities, but it's certainly not identical. It gives me a lot of comfort to know that this company has been through that, being able to talk with, and obviously, I was here part of this team, but we've got senior leaders up and down the management team who were part of this company, let it through there. It gives us confidence and what we've done in the past and what we can do in the future. And that's really something that's great to lean on. It's good to be able to lean on each other and know that we're on the right course.
Scott Berg: Got it quite helpful. Thanks for that, Lynn. And then from a follow perspective, both in the press release and on the call here, you all called out the impact of some of your ability to deliver professional services. It's sound that clearly can be moved from only but you've had a decent amount that's been delivered on-premise, what the customer over the last multiple years. Can you help quantify maybe what that impact looks like in the short-term? Or is it still just too difficult to build, maybe ascertain in terms of the impact of them in the court? Thank you.
Brian Miller: Scott, this is Brian. There are a couple of pieces to it. One, we're delivering the vast majority of our services remotely. And as we mentioned earlier, we are seeing customers who typically  just expected that those things would be on site, even if we have the ability to do it remotely that are they're certainly now more flexible about it. I'd say we were probably delivering somewhere around 85% of what we would have planned. And there's also a little bit of short-term adjustment as customers also all in one place to be able to accept some of the training or services. So I think that will continue to moderate as we go through this longer. One of the other factors is that included in services revenues, a significant amount of billable travel. Something on the order of $5 million a quarter of revenues that we recognize that are effectively little to know margin on those, but certainly affect our revenues. So they're grossed up on our income statement. And we've seen that go to just about zero. And again, we don't know exactly how rapidly that travel will resume. But likely some services will permanently be delivered remotely. And from an efficiency standpoint, utilization of our staff standpoint, that's a positive, but it will have an effect on -- negative effect on revenues, positive effect on margins.
Operator: Our next question will come from Peter Heckmann with D.A. Davidson.
Peter Heckmann: Hey, good morning. Thanks for all the information. Just a little follow-up on the pulling guidance and some of your commentary around maybe a more likely range for revenue growth, your prior guidance was calling for 11% to 13% growth and if I heard you correctly, they said maybe mid single digit might be more likely. When we think about that, I mean, is there a reasonable chance that the non-recurring portion of revenue could be down for the year versus prior expectations?
Lynn Moore: Yes, so Peter, as we said before, there's a little bit of uncertainty right now. There are still deals going forward. What we see is particularly deals that are in their later stages are going forward. We talked earlier, Scott was asking about implementation services, same thing, those that are more in the middle of projects versus the beginning of the projects are continuing. What we see right now that's sort of our best guess for the rest of the year. We met with management last week, as we do every quarter. We had them really give us their best guess on the impact of COVID on their particular business units. And it varies a little bit from business unit to business unit. Our business units recognize revenue differently. Some are more PLC based. Some work at a backlog, some little more dependent on quarterly licensed sales. But we met with them, we talked with them, we had them present what they considered sort of, bear case, bull case, and best case and we as a management team got together and said, this is sort of where we think we're going to land. As we said in my earlier comments, I'd expect you to have a lot more clarity in our Q2 conference call. And I'd probably like to reserve until the end to make much more detail on that.
Peter Heckmann: Okay. And then just a follow-up. I didn't hear you say at the Brian, look like the average term on subscription deals was a little over 50%. Can you talk about year-over-year growth of bookings on a constant term basis?
Brian Miller: Yes. The term had been the same bookings growth for the quarter were that right at 20%. There were, as you mentioned, there were two large $24 million and a $14 million SaaS deals both with the state of North Carolina as that were 10 year deals consistent with our tenure, court case management deal there. If you've taken those two deals out, the average term would have been about 4.3 years on all the rest of the contracts. But yes, it would have been right at 20% without if the term is in the same as last year's Q1.
Operator: Our next question will come from Matt Vanvliet with BTIG. Please go ahead.
Matt Vanvliet: I guess, wanted to dig in a little bit on some of the dynamics of the bookings through the quarter through April and what the pipeline is looking like and sort of what the sales forecasts are maybe seeking out on sort of a three six month basis, but you're looking at what your sales teams are focused on. Is there been a greater focus on contacting existing customers where you have the relationship and getting more response rates and sort of seeing what you can do from sort of virtual and work from home type elements with those customers? Are you seeing traction on new customers? Just curious and what the focus is then there? And then across the product platform? Are you narrowing your focus for the next couple months on specific areas that are allowing more e-filing allowing more remote contact? Or are you continuing to see sort of a broad based approach to the sales leadership? 
Lynn Moore: Yes, thanks, Matt. So I guess initially, you talk about pipeline. And I just want to reiterate our comments that we made earlier. There may be a slight demand in pause. But there's no real fundamental change in our industry demand. And right now, we don't really see a change in our pipeline. But although we do recognize there will be delays. We really haven't seen any meaningful cancellations.  As it relates to sales, it varies a little bit as I said, some processes that were already well down the road, those are continuing. We are doing remote demos, which are a little more different in fact, we just finished one last week and received an award after 13 hours of doing virtual remote demos. So a little bit new. Some of the things we talked about internally. We talked about, what are things, mitigation things steps that we can make, but also what types of opportunities are out there.  One of the things I think Tyler's always been really good about is while keeping their discipline also staying opportunistic. And some of the things you're missing you're talking about are some things we're talking about. We do believe that this will help accelerate the move to the cloud. So you see our sales, people will start talking about that they'll start promoting cloud and they start promoting our flips. We will put more emphasis on our mobile solutions, things like in our public safety mobility, even our payments. And my things like MyCivic, you talked about messaging. I think there was a question earlier, this is a really good opportunity to really sort of start honing our message on ROI. I mean, it's something that we know internally, but may not have always been a top priority for some of our customers. So, I think some of those things we're doing, and again, the impact of sales is sort of, you talked about reaching out to clients. Sometimes, as I mentioned in my earlier comments, just there's some logistical difficulties right now, because you have work from home environments, but we've talked about those messages and make sure that we're going to be equipped for when things return to normal.
Matt Vanvliet: Great. And then as you talk about, unlikely to have to remove any positions, but maybe hiring gets pulled back a little bit. Are there specific areas where in the near term, you're focusing on reducing hiring versus previous plan? Or is it just a general pause now to reassess over the next weeks and months of where business is picking back up and more of the focus is from a hiring perspective?
Lynn Moore: Yes. So, I would say the message I’ve sort of given to the team is cautious optimism. We need to see how things play out. But we -- but let’s not to forget the optimism part. We already had made some significant hires this year as part of our plans. As we've mentioned before, we're going to continue to invest in our long term strategic initiatives and so all those debt projects going to keep going and when you step back and you look at potential projects being delayed and things like that there may be some slight pause in hiring some of those services components. But overall, we're committed to our workforce committed to running the business in such a way that our current employees won't be impacted. We will continue to do some hiring. And as the year unfolds, and when we start seeing return to normal, and we'll start seeing some of that hiring again.
John Marr: And just to give you a little perspective, our plans for the year going into the year were to add about 500 net new heads. So we have a fair amount of flexibility there leavers to pull with respect to the timing and the volume of there’s -- but everyone said most likely on the professional services and implementation where we, I think, can plan to hire a couple of hundred people during the year that will likely be adjustments to that hiring, reflecting the change in more than being delivered remotely and delay.
Matt Vanvliet: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Hope everyone stays safe and healthy.
Operator: Our next question will come from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.
Keith Housum: Good morning guys. I just trying to reconcile the commentary in terms of deals being pushed off. And the ability to maintain the operating margin, is really that a function of the fact that perhaps your hiring this is not going to be as great. I guess the concern here is that your revenues not going to grow as much as you anticipated?
Brian Miller: I think the biggest factor there is, yes, there'll be less hiring and your expenses there, there are some offsets to expenses, particularly travel expense we mentioned health claims are down significantly and travel to any, I'd say the other big thing is that a lot of the revenues that are being reduced are our lowest margin revenues. I mentioned billable travel which has almost no margin. The professional services as you know are very low margin revenues for us. And even removing Connect, we mentioned we’ll take $6 million of revenues out of Q2 but that had no margin associated with it. So, the higher margin revenues, the subscription, some of the transaction based revenues, those are growing nicely. So the change in the profile net sales to something we believe we can still maintain flattish margins with last year, which was the expectations we came into the year.
Keith Housum: And then I guess as you try to think into 2021, is there concern that the budgetary pressures are being felt now by the local agencies, is that this could carry over into a multi-year I guess headwind?
Lynn Moore: Well, I think that's a possibility, as John alluded to earlier, there's different ways that projects are funded. There's different budget cycles. There are significantly still a lot of funding resources. One other things that people tend to forget or may not emphasize is that they're a lot of funding sources, property taxes are still probably the major funding source for state local government, really for local government, excuse me, for counties and cities. They comprise an overwhelming proportion of revenues as opposed to say sales tax. If you look at sales tax revenues, which are generally considered to be down, those comprise more around 7% of a budget for a county or city.  I also expect that there will be some more funding coming from the federal government. I think you may have seen earlier this week, that the Fed announced that it was broadening the number of local governments from which it would allow them to buy debt for them. Originally, they had talked about doing things for counties that were only 2 million and up, and that's been reduced to the populations of 500,000 cities to 250. But there will be some impact. And I think, it's our experience in the great recession was I mentioned earlier, the impact was really felt a little bit later. In my response to comments earlier, I think the thing about this is that there may be a little bit more compression in that impact. But, again, I think we'll have a little bit more clarity as we get through the year, particularly as we get through Q2, see the impacts, see what's happening as the states and local jurisdictions are returning to work. And then I think we'll be in a lot better position to answer that question.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Please go ahead. 
Jonathan Ho: I guess, just going back to your comments around past crises and the opportunity to maybe invest. Where do you see maybe the most opportunity to do so this time around? 
Lynn Moore: Yes, Jonathan, it's a good point. I think -- one thing I want to emphasize is something we've talked about for the last couple of years, which we have been -- we have already been investing at an elevated level. We've done that for a number of reasons. As I mentioned earlier, these projects, to me, that's an opportunity that we have initiated there's elevated investments across the board. I think you're going to continue to see us invest in our cloud initiatives. Those are not going away. And if anything, we may try to accelerate some of those. All the things that we've been talking about that are long-term strategic initiatives, we're going to continue to keep doing.  And then we'll continue across the broad base through our products. But again, I anticipate that this crisis will accelerate, further accelerate both the receptiveness and willingness as well as the move to the cloud. And I think we're going to continue to invest there heavily in the next couple years. 
Jonathan Ho: And then just as a quick follow-up. Are there potentially any projects that maybe get pulled forward or emergency buying for things like virtual courts or MyCivic, just wanted to see if there's any maybe new demand that could come out of this that's unexpected? 
Lynn Moore: We have a number of success stories out there but I would consider some quick responses from some of our divisions. We talked about virtual courts, we talked about what was going on in public safety. And I think, we've seen some of that. We have had a couple of deals where some local governments have tapped into emergency funding. I wouldn't say it's a significant number, but we've seen a little bit of that. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Rob Oliver with Baird. Please go ahead.
Rob Oliver: Great. Thank you guys very much for taking my question. I can't remember a one month time period in my career where local and municipal software has been in the news as much as it has over the past month or six weeks. I wanted to just ask about the North Carolina deals, you guys have to be extremely pleased with the follow on, the sizeable follow on wins in North Carolina. And I was just wondering if we could get a little bit more color on those? And then obviously, in the near term, there'll be some uncertainty but the extent to which you guys are able to template, your success in North Carolina and for that to other states would love to hear more? And I have one follow-up.
Lynn Moore: Yes, thanks, Rob. Yes. North Carolina has been a real success story for us. And you're right we're very excited. We talked about it last summer, when we announced the North Carolina Courts deal. One of the things we specifically talked about what some of the potential upside sell opportunities, we called out Brazos in particular. We spent a lot of time talking about the Brazos e-citations deal at the end of Q4, really great deal, largest deal really in Brazos history. Running in AWS, it's a great story. Shifting gears to something that we haven't talked a lot in detail as much as this Odyssey e-warrants. And again, this is a really great story. This is for a lot of reasons. Our Odyssey e-warrants is really all about its electronic transmissions of warrant applications between police officers in the field, and a judge who may be sitting in a courtroom or maybe at home at night. These are things that are time sensitive, potentially middle in night, evidentiary matters, maybe drawing blood on someone at a DY accident or doing something that's really have a time sensitive nature. This was a legacy product that state of North Carolina had. They talked with us about it and we said, hey, we can build that. And they trusted us. They building on that relationship. It's a 100% cloud base, built in AWS, it's going to be spun up very quickly. Target to go-live is actually next year, we expect to have about 49,000 users. It's a great story and it really further evidences our connected communities vision as we realize that it's, you're connecting the agencies, you're connecting the police agencies with the courts. Do you think it can be a differentiator not only on our court side, but also on our public safety side. So it's a really good opportunity. It's something that I'm extremely excited about. You said it builds on that earlier big contract with at the state of North Carolina. Your question about thinking a little bit broader. I think that e-warrants opportunity in North Carolina. It's a nice statewide opportunity. I think as you look out, I don't know that as you go to other jurisdictions, it will be on a statewide basis, I think you'll see a lot more deals more locally at the county level, you'll see things in some of our larger clients. So nobody else has this out in the market. I think it's something that's exciting as we look forward.
Rob Oliver: And then maybe going back to the first question that Kirk Materne asked. Obviously, your customers are showing a greater appetite for subscription, you guys have been kind of consistently beating the subscription number. And I know as John said, short and medium term, we're likely to see impact here from COVID. But as we all know, go back and try to look for patterns in comparison. So we go back to our way and that flattest slightly down here, you guys had, obviously that was perpetual license model at that point and, come to get people to make big purchases. Just wondering, if you could perhaps speculate on how the trajectory might be different. And if there's any early signs of that subscription buying could help change the trajectory out of this downturn this time. Appreciate it, guys. Thank you very much.
Lynn Moore: Well, you raised a good point. We weren't a lot different model back then in 2008, 2009. And certainly, as we go back to even say, the 911 or Y2K. I think coming around 2009, I think Tyler's subscription revenues were only about 17 million a year. Today, we're north of 300 million, which is obviously a different situation. The trajectory, as we talked about was a little bit delayed there. The impact was a little bit longer lasting. But as you look at a couple years, I think past, as past the recovery, I think Tyler's revenue growth was more in the 18% range. So the question is, how quick does that come? As we talk a lot of times, as we continue to move more to a subscription model, it's obviously a lot better long-term, it won't have necessarily the same pop into short-term. But as John's comments mentioned earlier, we feel really confident about our ability to be positioned to get an overwhelming piece of our share of the business as this pent up demand and I believe will return as we get on the other side of this.
Operator: Our next question will come from Tyler Wood with Northland Securities. Please go ahead.
Tyler Wood: Just one from me. You mentioned last quarter public safety win with Orlando and kind of your optimism there with large cities. Can you give us an update on that, maybe how the pipeline looks at that high end of the market in Q1, before things ground to a halt? And then just more generally, a little bit of color on your thinking around the COVID impact, and how it will vary between those larger Tier 1 to Tier 2 cities versus smaller local cities? 
Lynn Moore: Yes, sure Tyler. It's interesting when I talked earlier about this different business units. We've talked about that some times in the past as to how their customer base may be -- may or may or may not be more or less receptive to certain things. I would say in Q1, of all of our business segments, public safety probably was impacted a little bit more than our others. And primarily because the market they serve first responders and they're extremely focused on really more pressing local needs. We just spent a lot of time at the last call talking about the momentum in the market, that momentum is there, it's real. There are a number of large opportunities. I can say that a couple of them have been pushed. But as you look and we track and what we've track over the last several years is, is we track our ability to move up market, larger deals, larger license deals, deals in excess of 1 million approaching 2 million, but also the size of the customer in terms of calls for service as you approached over 500,000 to approaching a million. And those opportunities are continuing to be there. We did have see some delays there. I think we also saw in the public safety areas that customer base was probably a little bit customer base was probably a little bit more reluctant in the first quarter and since to accept remote delivery services. But in terms of overall demand and our ability to fill that demand, we are as confidence we were last quarter. The investments we've made are paying off. We're continuing to invest in those products, we continue to do things that we've talked about like mobility that are going to only make our products even that much more available, or more desirable.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Joe Goodwin with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
Joe Goodwin : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I just had a question around your -- how are you guys thinking about M&A in this environment? And maybe you could provide some color around the M&A pipelines and what that's looking like and kind of happening there? Thank you.
Lynn Moore: Yes, sure, Joe. I think generally, I probably just want to step back and just sort of, looking at what we've done historically and sort of our approach, our approach has always been to be very opportunistic. We've obviously done a lot of acquisitions. I think we talked last year, we had done about -- since 2018 and last year, we sort of taken approaches, a little bit of a deliberate pause, I would say, as we need to really integrate those acquisitions and make some investments and revise some product strategies. I think coming out towards the end of last year, our approach would have returned what I consider a more normal approach, which is something that we continually look at -- continue to look for opportunities. In recent years, we've talked a lot about the fact that it's been tough to do acquisitions, which is one reason why we've been increased our R&D spend. That's been for a number of reasons. There have been some hyper inflated valuations by sellers, a lot of bidding by PE firms. As I look out forward, I think we're going to continue to be opportunistic, I do think there's going to be an opportunity out there. I think the current environment may create some additional opportunities. We may see opportunities where we may have a few more motivated sellers. Some of their valuations may become more in line with what we think are reasonable. Some of the competition for some of these deals, which in the last several years have been PE firms, we've talked about the leverage that they've got on their balance sheets and the issues this pandemic may cause for them. So we may be able to compete a little bit better on our terms as we have in the past. It's been part of our history. We're going to continue to be optimistic and I expect that to continue as we go forward.
Operator: At this time there appears to be no more questions. Mr. John Marr, I will turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.
John Marr: Great. Thanks, Brent. Thanks for joining us on the call today. We appreciate your interest. Obviously, in interesting time and we appreciate all the questions. If you have any further questions, feel free to reach out to Brian, Lynn or myself. Thank you very much. Stay safe. Have a good day.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-13 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to today's Tyler Technologies Fourth Quarter 2019 Conference Call. Your host for today's call is John Marr, Chairman of Tyler Technologies. [Operator Instructions].  I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Marr. Please go ahead.
John Marr: Thank you, Kate, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2019 earnings call. With me on the call today are Lynn Moore, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like for Brian to give the safe harbor statement. Next, Lynn will have some preliminary comments, then Brian will review the details of the fourth quarter results and provide our guidance for 2020. Then I'll have some final comments and we'll take your questions. Brian?
Brian Miller: Thanks, John. During the course of this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information and may include projections concerning the company's future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Lynn?
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. We closed out 2019 by reaching 2 significant financial milestones as our annual revenue surpassed $1 billion and adjusted EBITDA exceeded $300 million for the first time. This was also our 33rd consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth as GAAP revenues grew 19.4% and non-GAAP revenues grew 18.3%. Organic revenue growth accelerated for the third consecutive quarter, returning to double-digit growth at 10.2% for non-GAAP revenues. Our core software revenues from licenses and subscriptions grew 30.5% on a non-GAAP basis, with 18.3% organic growth. The mix of new business was once again weighted more towards subscription arrangements, which represented approximately 52% of the total number of new deals and approximately 54% of new contract value signed this quarter. Over the last five years, the percentage of new SaaS business has continued to rise. And 2019 was the first year in which subscription arrangements made up more than 50% of the total contract value of new software deals, finishing at 63% for the year. This new business mix shift has put pressure on short-term revenue growth. If the mix of new business in 2019 have been similar to 2018, we estimate that 2019 revenue growth would have been approximately 160 basis points higher. As the trend toward greater cloud adoption continues to grow in our market, we are actively working with Amazon Web Services teams under the strategic collaboration agreement with AWS that we announced in October. We're currently refining road maps for optimizing Tyler products for the cloud and for transitioning certain clients hosted in our data centers to AWS. GAAP subscription revenues grew 34.3%, and non-GAAP subscription revenues grew 32.7%. Total recurring revenues from maintenance and subscriptions grew 22.7% on a GAAP basis and comprised 67.2% of total revenue. Although the mix of new business in the fourth quarter was weighted more towards subscription arrangements, software license and royalties revenue reached a new quarterly high at $32.4 million, an increase of 25.3% over Q4 of 2018, driven by strong sales in our public safety and MicroPact units. The total value of new contracts signed in the fourth quarter for New World Public Safety was more than double than last year's fourth quarter signings. Also, as we discussed last quarter, there were several significant MicroPact deals that were signed by our partners in the third quarter, but the related contracts with Tyler were signed in Q4 and contributed to this quarter's license growth. Bookings in the fourth quarter were particularly robust at approximately $331 million, up 33.5% over Q4 of 2018. Even excluding MicroPact, bookings were up approximately 26%. Bookings growth was primarily driven by the number of new deals, particularly midsized deals rather than by very large deals. And our largest new contract was just under $9 million. We signed 314 new software contracts in the quarter, a new record. For the full year 2019, we signed over 1,100 new software deals, approximately 44% more than last year. Our 6 largest SaaS deals of the quarter, each had total contract values of greater than $3 million. 2 of these were for Odyssey court case management solution, an $8.7 million contract with Franklin County, Ohio, the largest court system in the state; and a $3.6 million contract with Jefferson County, Texas. With the Jefferson County deal, we now serve courts in all of the 20 largest counties in Texas. We also signed two large multi-suite SaaS contracts that each included our Munis ERP, EnerGov Civic Services, ExecuTime time and attendance and Socrata Data Insight solutions. One with the city of Oxnard, California valued at $8.3 million and the other with the city of O'Fallon, Missouri, for $4.7 million. In addition, we signed 2 large SaaS contracts with clients in Florida for our EnerGov Civic Services solution, a $6.3 million contract with St. Johns County and a $5.6 million agreement with the city of West Palm Beach, which also included our Socrata Data & Insight solution. Our five largest on-premises license deals for the quarter, each had total contract values greater than $3 million. The largest was a multi-suite contract valued at $5.1 million with the city of Lawton, Oklahoma, which included our Munis ERP, EnerGov Civic Services, New World Public safety and Socrata Data & Insight solutions. The two largest license contracts for our MicroPact entellitrak solution were a $4.3 million contract for the Puerto Rico Vocational Rehabilitation Administration and a $4.2 million contract for the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs, Vocational Rehab and Employment Agency. We also signed a $4.2 million license arrangement with the city of Coral Springs, Florida for our Munis, EnerGov and ExecuTime solutions as well as a $3.5 million contract for our New World Public Safety solution with the city of Jackson, Mississippi, which is the largest public safety contract ever for New World. I'd also like to highlight a contract with the North Carolina Administrative Office of the Courts that we announced earlier this week. The contract, which was signed in the first quarter of 2020, is a 10-year $14.5 million SaaS agreement to provide our Brazos Electronic citation solution for over 500 law enforcement agencies state wide. It's a great example of our ability to expand existing client relationships through the unmatched breadth of our product suites. This latest contract builds upon our largest SaaS deal ever, an $85 million statewide contract for our Odyssey court case management solution in North Carolina, which was signed in June of 2019. As a point of reference, when we acquired Brazos in 2015, Brazos had annual revenues of approximately $10 million. As a result of the investments we've made in the Brazos products and organization and their integration into Tyler, we now generate approximately $17 million in annual revenues from Brazos, and this latest single contract is 1.5x their total revenues at acquisition. Now I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and provide our annual guidance for 2020.
Brian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2019. I'm going to provide some additional data on the quarter's performance and provide our annual guidance for 2020, and then John will have some additional comments. In our earnings release, we've included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the financial reports tab, schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. GAAP revenues for the quarter were $288.8 million, up 19.4%. On a non-GAAP basis, revenues were $287.4 million, up 18.3%. Organic revenue growth rose from the third quarter of 2019 to 10.6% on a GAAP basis and 10.2% on a non-GAAP basis. Our core software license and subscription revenues combined grew organically 18.3%. Subscription revenues for the quarter increased 34.3%. We added 164 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 18 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $74 million in total contract value. In Q4 of last year, we added 81 new subscription-based arrangements and had 8 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $33 million in total contract value. Subscription contract value comprised approximately 54% of total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 40% in Q4 of last year. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 4.4 years compared to 4.1 years in Q4 of last year. Revenues from e-filing and online payments, which are included in subscriptions, increased 25.5% to 200 -- I'm sorry, to $21.7 million. That amount includes e-filing revenue of $14.7 million, up 12.8% over last year and e-payments revenue of $7 million, up 65%. For the fourth quarter, our annualized non-GAAP total recurring revenue, or ARR, was $769.9 million, up 21%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS arrangements for Q4 was approximately $235 million, up 35.6%. Transaction-based ARR was approximately $87 million, up 25.5%, and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was approximately $448 million, up 13.7%. Our non-GAAP operating margin increased sequentially 10 basis points from 25.6% in the third quarter to 25.7% in the fourth quarter, that declined 110 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. The year-over-year decline reflects 2 major factors: our increased investment in R&D and the lower operating margins from acquisitions completed in the last 2 years, which are also receiving significant investments that affect their near-term profitability as they are integrated into Tyler. Our R&D expense in the fourth quarter increased 22.1% from last year, that was essentially flat sequentially from Q3. We believe the level of investment in emerging revenue streams like e-payments, existing products and recent acquisitions well positions us as we continue to focus on competitiveness and future growth while making progress towards improving margins. Our backlog at the end of the quarter reached a new high of $1.46 billion, up 16.9%. Backlog included $407 million of maintenance compared to $365 million a year ago. Subscription backlog was $606 million compared to $480 million last year and includes approximately $118 million related to fixed fee e-filing contracts. As Lynn noted, our bookings for the quarter were very strong at approximately $331 million, an increase of 33.5% from Q4 of last year. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1.3 billion, up 32.3%. Our software subscription bookings in the quarter added $12 million in new annual recurring revenue, up 52.5% over last year's $7.9 million. For comparison, if all of our new subscription contracts had been under license arrangements, we estimate that they would have represented additional license revenue of approximately $16 million. Cash flow from operations rose 7.5% to $76.2 million, while free cash flow declined by 0.5% to $66.5 million. For the full year of 2019, cash flow from operations increased 1.8% to $254.7 million. Free cash flow declined by 4.5% to $212.7 million, mainly due to an increased level of capital investments related to expansions and renovations at several of our office facilities. We ended the quarter with $314 million in cash and investments and no outstanding debt. Our guidance for the full year of 2020 is as follows: we expect 2020 GAAP revenues will be between $1.204 billion and $1.224 billion, and non-GAAP revenues will be between $1.205 billion and $1.225 billion. We expect 2020 GAAP diluted EPS will be between $3.81 and $3.93 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on the GAAP effective tax rate as well as the final valuation of acquired intangibles. We expect 2020 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $5.60 and $5.72, of which approximately 55% to 60% is expected to be generated in the second half of the year. For the year, estimated pretax noncash share-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $77 million. We expect R&D expense for the year will be between $92 million and $94 million. Fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between 41.5 million and 42.0 million shares. GAAP earnings per share assumes an estimated annual effective tax rate of 10% after discrete tax items, includes approximately $31 million of estimated discrete tax benefits related to share-based compensation, which may vary significantly based on the timing and volume of stock option exercises. Our estimated non-GAAP effective tax rate for 2020 is 24%. We expect our total capital expenditures will be between $36 million and $38 million for the year, including approximately $9 million related to real estate and approximately $7 million of capitalized software development costs. Total depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $80 million, including approximately $54 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to John for his comments.
John Marr: Thanks, Brian. We're pleased with our fourth quarter performance as we finished the year and the decade on a strong note. From a historical perspective, when we started the decade, our revenues were $290 million, with less than 50% of those recurring. Our stock price was $20.05, and our market cap was approximately $700 million. We finished the decade with revenues of more than $1 billion, of which 67% are recurring, a stock price of more than $300 and a market cap of approximately $12 billion. We're proud of our progress over the last 10 years and especially appreciative of our extremely talented team of more than 5,400 employees whose efforts are crucial to the success of Tyler and our clients. We're even more excited about the opportunities ahead of us as we build on our strengths to expand our markets and drive toward $2 billion in revenues. Our robust bookings in 2019, and particularly in the fourth quarter are indicative of our competitive strengths as well as an active marketplace. We expect to achieve double-digit organic revenue growth into 2020 and to show significant progress toward returning to the margin expansion trajectory that we achieved through most of the last decade. Although R&D expense is expected to increase approximately 15% in 2020, the rate of growth is significantly below that of the last 2 years and includes our increased investment in cloud technologies as we continue to work in partnership with AWS to accelerate our move to the cloud as well as increased investment and expanding our revenue streams for payments. Finally, Tyler was recently named for the second consecutive year to the Forbes Best Employers for Diversity List. Acceptance and inclusiveness are important attributes of our company culture, and we're honored to be recognized for this diversity. Now Kate, we'll take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Peter Heckmann with D.A. Davidson.
Peter Heckmann: Brian, could you talk a little bit about bookings for the quarter and the year? And just if you have it, a constant term comparison? I know that at least in the second quarter, the term -- the average term is a little bit longer.
Brian Miller: Yes. The average term of new software subscriptions in the fourth quarter was 4.4 years. Last year in the fourth quarter, it was 4.1 years. So that change would have had -- had we had the same term as last year, our bookings growth would have been 32.3% this quarter. So there were -- that mix, although, is -- as we've talked about, we've driven the average term length down over the last couple of years, leading with a shorter initial term. We still do some contracts that are 5 years. And the way the mix fell out this quarter is a little bit higher.
Peter Heckmann: Okay. Yes, so not much difference on a quarter-over-quarter basis. We assume it would be about the same, just a small difference in year-over-year growth for the full year '19?
Brian Miller: That's correct.
Peter Heckmann: Okay. And then just payments has been growing really, really nicely. Can you just remind us some of the areas that are contributing to that?
Lynn Moore: Yes, sure. Pete, this is Lynn. Payments is something that we've been doing for some time now. I'd say, in 2019, we've really taken a hard look at it and looked at the market and started thinking that this is really a potential strategic driver for us. As you know, it's transactional business. It's online transactions, it's credit card fees. It's things, for example, in our utility billing solutions, our tax, our courts, our payments for permitting and licensing, community development, parks and rec, miscellaneous payments. So historically, we've done a little bit of that. We're consolidating that internally in Tyler under a business unit and putting some investment and focus on that this year. And I do believe it's a stream that we're excited about in the future. I think it's something that you're going to see it grow and something that we can really capitalize on. But it -- I think it was John's comment, we -- it is something that will require a little bit more investment this year, as we bring all these various applications across these business lines together, work on a consistent UI and ID and stuff like that, but not long-term investments, but investments that will occur this year.
Operator: The next question is from Jonathan Ho with William Blair & Company.
Jonathan Ho: Congratulations on the strong bookings quarter. I just wanted to start out, just trying to understand if there was anything abnormal in 2019 in terms of the pipeline? Or as we look at 2020 and start to sort of contemplate the bookings activity and pipeline there, it's a sort of a sustainable level that you guys are seeing?
Brian Miller: I don't believe there's anything abnormal about the pipeline in 2019 as opposed to the pipeline we go into 2020 with -- obviously, in the middle of the year, we had those 2 very large contracts, particularly the $85 million SaaS deal in North Carolina. But we've continued to see strength as we mentioned on the call or on the comments earlier, it really wasn't -- fourth quarter didn't have any mega deals in it. It was a lot of solid mid-range deals and a high volume of deals. Certainly, we're seeing more volume of deals from the acquisitions we've made over the last couple of years, and MicroPact had a very strong fourth quarter as well as Public Safety. But we're very confident in the competitive position of both of those products. And as we've talked about in the past, that often there's a period of investment after acquisitions and after that we start to see the impact of leveraging our sales organization, leveraging our customer base. And we're certainly seeing that with public safety at this point. So I think we go into the year of 2020 with a strong pipeline. And -- but nothing particularly unusual about the market activity or the pipeline as we finish 2019.
Jonathan Ho: Got it. And then as we sort of look at the public safety performance in the fourth quarter, can you talk about what made the most difference in terms of the investments? And maybe compare and contrast the opportunities that you could target and win rates relative to maybe last year?
Lynn Moore: Yes, Jonathan, I think the -- as you -- we've talked about this for several years now, the investments we've been making at Public Safety, and part of it is -- too is as we talk a lot of these things take time. We've had a lot of success over the last couple of years, both in sales, but then actually starting to implement and getting those customer references. Those investments are paying off. I think we mentioned the number of licenses in the Q4 of this year were more than double of last year. Same thing with number of new names. There's just a lot of momentum going on in the marketplace right now and really validates our strategy. But it's also -- it's a testament to the work those -- that the folks at Public Safety have been doing. We talk a lot about the reputation of business. And there's been a lot of work going on. It takes time.  We talk about -- it's slow moving, but it starts gaining momentum. And I think we're starting to see that. And so it's investments -- obviously, in CAD, we've got some big projects coming out with our e-records. But a lot of the new stuff we've been doing, for example, around mobility and things like that, that's really put us sort of the cutting-edge in the public safety market right now. So we're excited to get those big deals. We've talked about how we're moving up market and getting larger deals. We've also starting to -- similar like we do with courts a couple of years ago, we talked about Franklin County and how we were making inroads into Ohio. We're seeing some of that in public safety. We're just starting to crack into some markets they hadn't cracked into before. And also, I'd say, leveraging our -- the inside sales channel, leveraging other products, bringing Brazos along, we mentioned a lot in Oklahoma deal, where we're partnering with other sales teams at Munis and sort of leveraging the whole Tyler -- total Tyler concept has really been resonating with the Public Safety customers.
Operator: The next question is from Rob Oliver with Baird.
Robert Oliver: Lynn, one for you. Clearly, some early success here with new subscription offerings from you guys over the past year, and that's been a pivot, we've seen that number grow nicely. I'm curious, the pace of conversions more than doubled, albeit still off of a really small base. I'm just curious how you guys think about that conversion side of the story versus selling new subscriptions? How you are thinking about it from a go-to-market perspective, if you're thinking about approaching clients early -- earlier than the renewal point of their contract? And then, as you look at your pipeline of renewals over the next couple of years, how you think about that? And then I just had 1 quick follow-up for Brian.
Lynn Moore: Yes, sure, Rob. I mean, you're right. We've talked about it. The market continues to tend to shift towards Saas. As we look at conversions, it is something that we're thinking about and mapping out plans, that obviously also lines up with our strategic collaboration with AWS. I don't know that we'll necessarily have a significant acceleration of that planned in the near term, but it is something that we are looking at. Stepping back, our relationship with AWS, we are trying to modernize our products. We do recognize the shift, but there still is a piece of the market that is still focused on on-prem, and we want to make sure we don't lose that as we go through this change and recognize the shift in the market.
Robert Oliver: Great. And then, Brian, just for you quickly. You guys obviously are coming off this period, the last couple of years, where you had elevated R&D growing around 30-ish percent. It looks like it's going to be up 15% this year. So seeing that moderation that I think you spoke about, I know John mentioned in his comments that you guys would be sort of returning to that margin growth again. Is that -- I'm not sure if I missed it, if there's a time line on that. So are we then assuming that this trajectory now you've established of that R&D growth moderating will continue beyond this year without giving specific guidance?
Brian Miller: Yes, I think that's a correct assumption. Our R&D guidance is up around 15% from this year, which -- from '19, which is about half the growth rate that we've seen in the last 2 years. Actually, if you look at the run rate that we exited Q4 with, the 2020 R&D is only up about 10% from that Q4 run rate. So it is moderating. The R&D around our products -- existing products is flattening. We've sort of grown into that level. Lynn talked about some of those investments we've made in public safety, broadly across our product lines. So most of the incremental R&D is around the acquired companies, emerging revenue streams like payments and our -- optimization of our products for the cloud. So we talked about sort of growing into this higher level of R&D and seeing that moderate, and I think you'll continue to see that. From a margin perspective, I think the midpoint of our guidance for next year implies roughly flat margins with 2019 after a couple of years of declines, mostly driven by the increased R&D and the acquisitions. And I think we would expect to see that improves -- lead towards improved margins as we move out of 2020. But certainly, getting back on that trajectory of margin improvement that we've historically seen is a key part of our long-term model.
Lynn Moore: Rob, if I could add to that. I think, historically, we've taken a pretty balanced approach to investing in growth and focusing on margin expansion. And we've talked about in the last few years about the elevated investments, and as Brian mentioned, growing into those and potentially redeploying some of those. It is a focus on us to look at margin expansion opportunities. But at the same time, I want to be careful to also recognize that when we see market opportunities out there, marketing opportunities, either a new or emerging revenue stream like Tyler payments, changes in the competitive landscape, either see some weakening of some competitors or we see some opportunities with some competitive advancements in our products or shifts in the market as we continue to move to the cloud and we think about modernizing our apps, which we think over time will also lead to margin expansion. We will continue to take advantage of those opportunities. I just want to make sure that, that's also set out there.
Operator: The next question is from Kirk Materne with Evercore.
Stewart Materne: Congratulations on the nice end to the fiscal year. Maybe John or Lynn, if you guys could just talk a little bit about the broader market? Obviously, you service a market that doesn't exactly move on a dime in terms of technology trends, but the number of deals and the velocity of deals, I think, this quarter was really impressive. [indiscernible] major deal from a bookings growth perspective. So are you just reaching a much broader audience of deals at this point in time? Or how do you see sort of your end market, is that picking up? I'm just trying to get a sense on how much of this is sort of the market may be picking up a little bit in terms of spending? And then how much of this is you being able to sort of go after a much broader set of opportunities?
Lynn Moore: Yes. Sure, Kirk. I'll start and let John jump in. From my perspective, as Brian mentioned, the market and the pipeline are solid. I wouldn't say that there's been any material change in the last quarter or 2 on some level. I think it's a little bit of validating some of our investments. We've been increasing our competitive position. We've been doing things both internally with builds and through acquisitions. We're out there executing really well in the market. There still continues to be a lot of activity that's outside of RFP. I don't know that that's anything specific to the market as so much as our internal performance and validating our -- again, our prior R&D investments.
John Marr: Yes, I think that's right. I would say that, Kirk, it's more attributable to our addressable market space. So we continue to try to broaden the breadth of products we have through organic builds as well as the acquisitions we've done, the size and range of clients that we're competitive with. So some of our products were competitive in certain size, cities or communities, and we've broadened that. Public safety would be a good example, as we announced in this one of the largest deal ever. In terms of market size, the only thing I'd say that's a little different and it's -- again, more of it's attributable to what we're addressing in the marketplace. Some of these companies that we competed with pretty recently are maybe becoming a little more legacy and their attrition is accelerating to some degree. So some of the better competitors we've had over the last 10 years, I think, are seeing significantly higher attrition rates than what we experience in most of our products. And those are really good opportunities. Those are the right-sized cities and counties and districts that we look for. And as they come back in the marketplace, that -- those are really good opportunities for us.
Stewart Materne: And then just one last one for you all. And I realize it's too early in terms of the AWS relationship. But as you think about sort of the technology shift towards AWS as your infrastructure platform. Did you have any thoughts on how that might inform your thought process around M&A? Meaning are you be able to build perhaps a little bit faster if you have a little bit more flexible infrastructure? Would it slow you down from buying some of the companies you bought, if they would have to be ported over? I'm assuming it's maybe too soon for you guys to have really definitive view on that, but I'd be curious if that's come up at all as you guys think about sort of build versus buy over the next couple of years?
Brian Miller: Hey, Kirk...
John Marr: Interestingly, some of the acquisitions we've done already -- they already had maybe more comprehensive relationships with AWS. So it will work both ways. There could be some acquisitions that aren't as cloud oriented or have other facilities that they're using, but AWS is a big player. So a lot of the acquisitions we do are obviously smaller companies than us. They don't have their own clouds. They generally hosted somewhere else. And AWS is a place where many of them may already be hosted. So it will work both ways, but in a lot of cases, the target companies are AWS customers.
Operator: The next question is from Scott Berg with Needham & Company.
Scott Berg: Congrats on a very strong quarter. I guess, I can't remember who said it, I think it was John in the pre-scripted remarks that you expect organic revenue growth to remain in the double-digit range here in 2020. I guess, can you unpack that a little bit? And I asked the question relative to assumptions around mix on new deals that are subscription or license. Usually, we see a company as they tilt stronger towards subscriptions, revenue growth kind of decelerates or is a little bit lower because of the rev rec impact of the shifting transaction mix.
Brian Miller: Yes. And I think that the midpoint of our guidance implies and certainly the upper point implies double-digit growth, just a little north of 10%. The lower end of the guidance range would be a little bit below that. I think the organic implied range is roughly 9% to close to 11%. There's a couple of things. Now licenses are well under 10% of our total revenues. So the impact, as more of our businesses become subscription driven over the last few years, is less significant. I think we're starting to see some of the contribution from some of our recent acquisitions, which generally we expect to grow above Tyler's core organic growth rate. And also as some of our subscription arrangements that were longer-term arrangements entered into in prior years start to come up for renewals and see increases in those, that also helps contribute to the growth.  So there are a number of factors there. The exact mix of new business between SaaS and license is difficult to estimate, often customers make that decision late in the process. So even with deals that have happened this quarter, there are a few that we're not certain which way they're going to go. But generally, I'd say, the assumption is that the mix of subscriptions will be a little bit higher in 2020 than it was in 2019. But again, 2019 was skewed a bit by the very large deal in North Carolina. And we continue to see a mix in those larger deals that's weighted even generally a little bit more heavily towards license deals, although that's changing over time. So there are a number of factors that go into that growth rate. But it clearly is accelerating a bit from what we've seen in 2019.
Scott Berg: Very helpful. And then for from follow-up perspective, just trying to think about the model with the increasing payments and transaction mix going forward, even though it's a small change. But can you remind us what the kind of the gross margin profile is on those more transactional revenues? And just trying to understand if that's maybe a tailwind or headwind for margins as it becomes a greater mix of the business going forward?
Brian Miller: So I think it's certainly a tailwind for margins over the long term. Those transactional margins, we don't really break them out completely. But the margins on those are well above our blended overall margins, particularly when we get any start-up costs associated with a new contract behind us. But those would be margins, I think, on a payments arrangement or a e-filing arrangement that's at scale, that fully implemented, those margins would be well above our blended overall margins.
Operator: The next question is from Charlie Strauzer of CJS Securities.
Brendan Popson: This is Brendan on behalf of Charlie. So I just want to ask, looking at the R&D beyond just this year. Do you see an inflection point where you get operating leverage on that line? Or is there just too many opportunities right now and you think, at least for a while, you'll be, I guess, outgrowing your top line with R&D or similarly? And then another -- the second question with New World, obviously, a really strong quarter with public safety, and really exciting that you got the Jackson contract. Is there any other progress going on with moving upmarket beyond the Jackson deal?
Brian Miller: With respect to R&D, yes, we -- I'd say, beyond 2020, as Lynn said, we sort of reserve the right to adjust our investments to address market opportunities, competitive opportunities and to take advantage of those over the long term. But generally, we would expect that we continue to see more leverage in R&D after this period of elevated investments over the last couple of years, and 2020 certainly shows progress towards that. In the public safety area, one of the goals of the increased investments we've made in that product at New World over the last couple of years was to position ourselves to have the features and functionality to compete for larger opportunities. And we've seen some evidence of that this year going live in Orlando, Florida, a jurisdiction that has more than 1 million calls for service through its 911 system each year. And now the Jackson deal being the largest deal in New World's history. But we're still kind of in the early stages of that. These are long sales processes. And it's only been within the last year that we've really been in a position to start to respond to those larger RFPs. So we would expect there to be meaningful opportunities ahead for us to continue to pursue larger deals in the public safety area and to be successful there.
Lynn Moore: And I think the follow-on, the public safety thing is, it's -- a big result of that is the fact that we've really got a competitive offering across a full suite of public safety solutions. So as we continue to build out and bring additional solutions to market as well as leverage other pilot products, for example, in Jackson, it's just -- it's not just CAD and records, but it's fire records. It's our mobile solutions. It's Tyler Corrections that we've been investing in. It's our Brazos offering. It's Socrata. So when you're able to -- you're able to compete in those larger jurisdictions when you have a fuller suite of competitive offerings.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. The next question comes from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research.
Keith Housum: Can you just remind me in terms of the AWS agreement in terms of any impact on R&D? Is there a time where the investment to put everything to the cloud is going to, I guess, peak? And how long will that period last out of the additional investments to get out and over into the cloud?
Lynn Moore: Yes, Keith. So as we talked about over the last year, while there are already some initiatives going on within Tyler, part of what the AWS agreement did was, it's helping us move there across all our product suites together. And we're still -- we're still finalizing some of those product road maps. We're obviously making -- already starting to make some investments on those. The timing of those are going to take -- it's going to take a couple of years. These things aren't going to happen overnight. At the same time, we're still going to be investing our competitiveness, but we're also evolving the back end architecture to make them more cloud efficient. So I wouldn't put a specific time line on it right now, but it's not 12 months, but it's not 5 years, it's somewhere in between.
Keith Housum: Okay. Appreciate it. And just a follow-up, I hope I'm not getting too granular here into the guide. But a look at the software licenses, gross margins over the past year or two, actually, those have come down a little bit. How do you think -- I guess, what's happening there that would cause it to come down? And how should we think about the gross margins, the software licenses business and royalties next year?
Brian Miller: I think some of the change in the margins there is around the amortization of software, the allocation of purchase price of acquired companies to software. So typically, when we acquire someone, part of their purchase price is allocated to the acquired software and that amortization, which is generally over 5 years or less, is expensed as part of the cost of software. So given the elevated level of acquisitions we've had over the last couple of years, that's driven that up a bit. So I would expect -- these costs are not incremental costs, but they stay at the same level. So I'd expect that as -- in software licenses, we probably expect to see something like mid-single-digit growth in those next year. And so you probably see margins be similar to this year, including the amortization.
Operator: At this time, there appear to be no more questions. Mr. Marr, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.
John Marr: Okay. Thanks, Kate, and thanks for joining us on the call today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Lynn, Brian or me. Have a great day.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-30 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Wyndham Destinations' Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference call is being recorded. If you do not agree with these terms please disconnect at this time. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Chris Agnew. Please go ahead.
Chris Agnew: Thanks, Catherine. Good morning and welcome. Before we begin, we'd like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, and the forward-looking statements made today are effective only as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in our SEC filings, and you can find a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call and our earnings press release on our Web site at investor.wyndhamdestinations.com. This morning, Michael Brown, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview on our strategic objectives and our third quarter results, and Mike Hug, our Chief Financial Officer, will then provide greater detail on our results and discuss our outlook. Following these remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions. With that, I am pleased to turn the call over to Michael Brown.
Michael Brown: Thank you, Chris. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're happy to report the third quarter was another strong quarter, demonstrating the strength of our business model, cash flow generation, and commitment to returning cash to shareholders. This morning, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.57 versus our $1.46 to $1.54 guidance. We reported adjusted EBITDA of $267 million, and year-to-date adjusted free cash flow of $466 million. For the full-year, we are increasing guidance for adjusted EPS and adjusted free cash flow. We are narrowing our adjusted EBITDA guidance after updating for the impact of Hurricane Dorian. Gross VOI sales in the third quarter increased 4% over the prior year on a 4% increase in tours. We also had sequential and year-over-year improvement in our loan loss provision to 20.3% of gross VOI sales. Since our last earnings call, we closed on two strategic transactions. Last week, we sold Wyndham Vacation Rentals to Vacasa for $162 million. On August of 7th, RCI acquired Alliance Reservations Network, or ARN, for $102 million. ARN is a travel technology platform that will enable us to provide integrated travel services and value-added benefits to RCI and other closed user groups. This acquisition enables RCI to build a vertically integrated travel business by enhancing the value proposition of its core business, and opening doors to business-to-business diversification and new channels of growth. These two transactions demonstrate our commitment to the growth of our core business by optimizing the allocation of resources strategically across the enterprise. We're very excited about the acquisition of ARN. The business provides the platform and technology to enable RCI to expand its membership business, which is core to our strategy. The integration of ARN is well underway, and we continue to unlock new efficiencies and opportunities between our businesses. RCI already has programs in development to improve the customer experience. One such program we have implemented is our Deposits plus Cash program allowing greater flexibility for our exchange members. Deposits plus Cash is a program where our RCI members can purchase accommodations through ARN with a combination of RCI currency and cash. RCI's other initiatives that focus on improving the customer experience by simplifying the booking process and offering more travel alternatives continue to gain momentum and help to improve the revenue per member trend. Let me now switch gears to discuss a key strategic partnership, which is important for our growth. In September, we announced that we extended our marketing relationship with Caesars Entertainment through 2030. Caesars is an outstanding partnership that supports our open market platform of nearly 800 million in new owner sales. This relationship has generated significant value to us over the 20 years Caesars has been a partner, and last year alone delivered approximately 40,000 tours to our Las Vegas sales offices. This 10-year renewal secures a significant new owner to our pipeline going forward. Our Wyndham Vacation Clubs customer and owner engagement initiatives continue to progress and pay dividends. We saw growth in new owner transactions to the Gen X and millennial segments, continued growth in our Blue Thread initiative, and had consistent strong growth in owner arrivals and sales. Year-to-date, owner arrivals increased 41,000, which was 8% higher than the prior year. This success with owner arrivals does have a natural dilution to our new owner sales mix. This was amplified over the important Labor Day weekend due to Hurricane Dorian. We remain confident in new owner sales and are generating enough new owners to achieve our long-term sales objectives. So far this year, we added 29,000 new owners and increased new owner tours by 4% in the quarter. 68% of new owner sales are to Gen X and millennials, which is 20% growth year-over-year in the quarter and 18% year-to-date. And last, Blue Thread sales continue to be strong, increasing 24% in the third quarter and 29% year-to-date. This strategic partnership with the Wyndham Rewards program continues to drive more engaged customers who deliver over 25% higher VPGs and overall new owner VPGs. Our long-term strategy of new owner growth will continue to occur as new sales centers and marketing locations ramp. Switching to capital allocation, we demonstrated once again our commitment to returning cash to shareholders with $371 million in dividends and share repurchases year-to-date through October the 29th. Since the spin in June of 2018, we have now returned 17% of our market cap to shareholders in 17 months. We are committed to our quarterly dividend, which expresses confidence in our ability to consistently generate free cash flow, and in the absence of compelling transactions, we believe the best use of excess free cash flow remains share repurchases. Since we laid out our initial guidance in 2019, we have increased free cash flow twice totaling $25 million. This encompasses our commitment to generate free cash flow, while identifying efficiencies in our business. To conclude, I would like to reinforce three major takeaways from our recent performance. First, we closed on two strategic transactions that were important milestones for RCI and Wyndham Destinations. Second, Blue Thread sales increased 24% in the quarter, and are up 29% year-to-date, and lastly regarding our outlook for the full-year, we are increasing our adjusted net income, adjusted EPS, and adjusted free cash flow guidance. With that, I would like to hand the call over to hand the call over to Mike Hug. Mike?
Mike Hug: Thank you, Michael, and good morning everyone. Today, I'd like to discuss our third quarter results and our 2019 outlook. My comments will be primarily focused on our adjusted results. You can find our complete results in our earnings release, including reconciliations of adjusted and further adjusted amounts to GAAP numbers. Our third quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $1.57, an increase of 7% over the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $267 million and adjusted EBITDA margin was 24.2% in the third quarter. Third quarter gross realized sales increased 4% year-over-year to $663 million, with a 4% increase in tours and a 1% decline VPG, excluding the impact of Hurricane Dorian, we estimate year-over-year growth in tours would have been closer to 6%. Tough VPG comps in the prior year impacted the year-over-year comparison in the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the Vacation Ownership segment was flat over the prior year at $203 million with revenue growth of 5% offset by higher cost of inventory and increased sales and marketing cost. As communicated, our second quarter earnings call, we expected the higher cost inventory in the third quarter, and we continue to expect this to be offset by lower product cost in the fourth quarter. In our exchange business, revenue increased 3%, driven by a 1% increase in the average number of members, and the inclusion of ARN, which was slightly offset by 1% decline in revenue per member. As expected, the revenue per member rate is tracking positively compared to historical trends, and excluding currency was close to flat year-over-year. The exchange segment benefited from strong cost control has adjusted EBITDA increased 5% over the prior year to $83 million. Turning to the provision per loan loss as a percentage of gross VOI sales, the provision again improved to 20.3% from 21.2% in the second quarter this year, and 20.8% in the third quarter of last year. We remain confident in the actions we are taking to continue to reduce the provision, and we anticipate further sequential improvement in the fourth quarter, allowing us to achieve our full-year 2019 provision guidance. Our adjusted free cash flow for the first nine months of 2019 was $466 million, compared to $356 million in the same period of 2018. The increase was due to higher net income from continuing operations, and higher net securitization activity. We are confident in our free cash flow for this year with the execution of three securitizations. The third that we completed last week was a $300 million transaction with a weighted average coupon of 2.76%, and an advance rate of 98%. We were very pleased with these terms, which again confirm our proven track record of being able to access the ABS markets. Turning to our balance sheet, as of September 30, we had $250 million of cash and cash equivalents with corporate debt at $3 billion, which excludes $2.5 billion of non-recourse debt related to our securitized receivables. With our net leverage at 2.9 times within our target leverage, our capital allocation remains consistent in the third quarter. By the end of the year, we anticipate net leverage will be around 2.8 times. We declared a cash dividend of $0.45 per share on August 15, which was paid to shareholders on September 30. And as Michael mentioned, we continued with share repurchases in the third quarter. We bought back $90 million of stock at a weighted average price of $44.45 cents per share, with total of 2 million shares. In the month of October, we continue with repurchases of $30 million. Now, let me turn to our outlook for the remainder of the year. Adjusting for the impact of Hurricane Dorian, we are narrowing our just EBITDA guidance to be in the range of $990 million to $1 billion. We are increasing our outlook for adjusted diluted EPS to a range of $5.54 to $5.62 from $5.38 to $5.58, primarily on lower interest and tax expense, as well as lower share account. As a reminder, our outlook for EPS is based on a dilutive share count of 92.8 million shares, which assumes no further share repurchases after September 30, 2019. For the fourth quarter of 2019, we expect adjusted dilutive EPS to range from $1.49 to $1.57. The fourth quarter will benefit from strong to flow, lower inventory costs as well as a lower provision. This will be mostly offset by lower VPG, which is a mix impact from the stronger new arm to flow expected in the fourth quarter. For adjusted free cash flow, we are increasing our guidance to $565 million to $585 million, which is $10 million higher than the prior guidance range. With respect to our key drivers, for the full-year, we now expect VPG to be in the range of flat to up 1%. We continue to expect tours to be at the lower end of a range of 5% to 7%, in spite of the loss of approximately 6,000 tours from Hurricane Dorian. For the exchange business, we continue to believe average number of members will be flat to up 2% and revenue per member will be flat to down 2%. To conclude, we are very pleased with our performance in the third quarter, our improved outlook for full-year EPS growth of 15% strong free cash flow. With that, we'd like to turn the call back to Catherine and open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from David Katz with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
David Katz: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Michael Brown: Good morning, David.
David Katz: Look, I wanted to ask a kind of a bigger picture question and just to let you sort of take it where you want. I see the operational progress and the cash generation that's impressive that comes out it, and what I think we would probably agree is a valuation around the stock that doesn't necessarily capture all of that. Have you thought about things you could do or other ways to kind of highlight that value that are perhaps a bit more active or proactive about it, whether it's taking up leverage or what have you, because I think we have sort of had this discussion a couple of times in the past, and good quarter.
Michael Brown: David, it's a really important question, and I think there's a lot at play here, but let's step back because I think where you started the question itself is very important is, at the same time when we started our Wyndham Destinations as a public company, the questions were all around can you generate cash flow, what will you do with your loan loss provision, can you consistently deliver on the strategy you've laid out. And as we've moved six quarters into our public forum the questions don't seem to be around those elements. We're trying to consistently deliver our operating metrics, but the reality is, and I don't think it's limited to our company and I don't even think it's limited to our sector, there's probably not many companies within the gaming, lodging, leisure sector that don't look at valuations at the moment and say this late cycle impact is not rightly justifying what everyone would view as the right value for our corporation. We think the best route to getting maximum value back to the shareholders is twofold. Number one is, look at what we've done in the last four months between the ARN and the sale of our North American rentals. We're not waiting for the Street to recognize our valuation. We're out there modifying our business and evolving it to be in the best position for long-term growth, and these two transactions, in my opinion, do exactly that. We're not on the sidelines just trusting our core business will deliver. We will continue to modify and evolve. So, to your question about what actions will you take, we will continue to look at all opportunities out there and our two most recent transactions I think demonstrate our commitment to not simply being satisfied with status quo, and in the meantime, we will continue to do what we said we would do when we came out as a public company is deliver a lot of free cash flow back to shareholders in the form of dividends and repurchases, and continue to deliver very consistently the core of our operating strategy which is cash flow, EBITDA growth, and consistent margins which are industry-leading.
Mike Hug: And I would add one thing to that.
David Katz: Okay.
Mike Hug: On the leverage piece, I mean, leverage isn't the only way for us to increase the capital return to shareholders. I think if you looked at how we started the year, we were about $60 million a quarter in share repurchases and we've been able to consistently increase that through finding ways to generate cash, whether it's great execution on the ABS transactions, the sale of our ARN, which -- I'm sorry, the sale of the North American rental business which generated over $100 million in cash. So we are very focused on, even with out levering up, doing the right things to generate cash out of this business making sure we're utilizing every asset we have to drive cash, which has allowed us once again to continue to increase the level of share repurchases every quarter.
Michael Brown: And David, I think I heard a follow-up, David, as well?
David Katz: Yes, and just, Mike Hug, I would ask how you think about kind of where the top end of leverage really could be, I mean, we certainly -- there certainly aren't no circumstances where it doesn't make sense to take on a bit more leverage to buy back a little bit more stock under these kinds of circumstances.
Mike Hug: Well, I mean I think what we've said is, we've said our range is [2.25] [ph] to three times, we're at 2.9 times, and I wouldn't expect us to over that for share repurchases. Once again, we're doing all the right things to drive the cash to increase the level of share repurchases, but at this point in the cycle, don't know that it would be smart to take leverage over three times to get better additional share repurchase. I think we can once again accomplish additional share repurchases by things that we do in the business.
David Katz: Got it, thank you very much.
Mike Hug: Thank you, David.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Chris Woronka: Hey, good morning, guys.
Michael Brown: Good morning, Chris.
Mike Hug: Good morning.
Chris Woronka: Good morning. Wanted to ask on the kind of the new owner mix, I think third quarter was probably an example of a good problem to have in that you had a very strong response from your current owners, but obviously you still kind of have the long-term targets in mind to increase the owner mix. So the question is really kind of how much can you consciously pivot to get those new owners in, and does that kind of impact our thinking on sales and marketing going forward?
Michael Brown: Chris, it's -- again, that has been one of the key pillars of our strategy, and will remain a key pillar as we go forward. What we know about and the importance of new owners is that they provide a very predictable future revenue stream for the business. So continuing to drive absolute numbers of new owners is very important, but to get to the third quarter specifically, you phrased it, I think, absolutely correctly, which is it's a good problem to have. We have been out there really committed to increased owner engagement, and our owner engagement initiatives have lead to 41,000 incremental arrivals through the first nine months of this year on an owner base of 880,000 members. So, we're putting a lot more people on vacation, and that naturally is driving more opportunities for our sales team on owner sales. That those incremental sales is creating dilution in our percentage, as a percent of the total sales, our new owner sales mix. It doesn't change our strategy, either in the short-term or in the long-term. We will continue to drive new owner sales, so much the fact that when we were a little soft on new owner tours in the first-half of this year we've really put our foot to the pedal, and are driving accelerated new owner tour growth in the second-half of this year. We're excited about what the second-half is going to prove out to be, and we think we're going to have a very strong fourth quarter. So, we're committed to it. Keep in mind that we over-exceeded that 200 basis points last year, I think we ended the year about 250 basis points up, this year we're softer. We're softer for the right reasons, but the core element of driving incremental new owner tours is also there, our Blue Thread initiatives growing about 25%, where we said it would be. The issues we had in the first-half of the year were singular, they weren't macro-related, and we're committed to getting over 40%, and then ultimately to 45% in new owner sales as a percent of total sales.
Chris Woronka: Okay, very helpful. And then just second, on the ARN acquisition, I don't know exactly kind of what the longer-term revenue and EBITDA impacts are kind of vis-à-vis what you gave up with rentals, but I guess, do you think that vacation exchange unit is kind of strategically complete or do you see more out there that you could do, because I think you've done a great job of getting margins up there, and maybe a little commentary on whether there's still more you're looking to do on the margin front, but also whether that can still be a growth platform with acquisitions.
Michael Brown: Chris, this is an area that I am, I guess if I say I'm quietly excited on a quarterly earnings call. It's not so quite anymore, but I'm really excited about this acquisition because for from my two years with the company we've always talked about RCI as the leader in the exchange business that generates great free cash flow with little capital investment. All of that is still true today. What this acquisition offers us is two things; it provides us more opportunity in our core exchange business, and this Deposits plus Cash that I mentioned, is it financially material today? Absolutely not, but I think all of us who have booked a hotel room have not had enough loyalty programs to book that last night and you've used cash. Well, why can't that be the case in the timeshare business? And it is just an example of how we can start to make exchange, make opportunities, make transaction possibilities in our core strategy a reality, and then it also because of the nature of the technology platform ARN provides it allows us to be a little more broad into the travel and tourism space. All of that is prolonged to a very short answer, which is, yes, I think that you can start to think about in the future a growth component to a great cash flow and low capital business segment of Wyndham Destinations.
Chris Woronka: Okay, very helpful. Thanks, Mike.
Michael Brown: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Patrick Scholes with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Patrick Scholes: Hi, good morning, Mike and Mike.
Michael Brown: Hi, Patrick. Good morning.
Mike Hug: Good morning.
Patrick Scholes: Good morning, I have bit of a -- I would say three-part question on how to think about certain items for modeling for 2020. The first part of that is with the acquisition of Alliance Reservations Network, how should we think about the full-year EBITDA contribution for that, and does that essentially offset the lost EBITDA from the sale of vacation rentals? Secondly, on Hurricane Dorian disruption this year, is that possible you're going to get any of that back through tour re-bookings, or is that just completely out the door at this point? And then lastly -- sorry, I'm throwing a lot at you here.
Michael Brown: That's all right.
Patrick Scholes: -- lastly with the positive trajectory of the loan loss provision, is it fair to think that at least preliminary that next year's percentage will be a bit lower than this year's 20.5%? That's it.
Michael Brown: Mike, why don't you take those?
Mike Hug: Yes, sure. So, on the first one, ARN and North America rentals, basically on an annual basis, those numbers are comparable. So when you're modeling and thinking about 2020, you can just assume that the ARN EBITDA offsets the North America rentals, and when we come out with our guidance next year we will help us far as a quarterly spread or revenues and EBITDA for ARN. On Dorian, anything that we would have gotten back, we factored in potentially on the owner tours, you might get those back if they travel within now between -- and the end of the year, on the new owner side, usually that's a tour that's lost because school has started and a lot of times people aren't getting back on vacation before the end of the year. So, anything we would get back would be pretty minimal and is considered in our guidance for the remainder of the year, for the fourth quarter. As far as the loan loss provision, we're very excited about the progress we're making there. We were happy with the continued sequential improvement in the third quarter, and would expect that in the fourth quarter. At this time, we are providing guidance on really any aspect of the business, but we will provide our thoughts on that when we have our call in late February of next year.
Michael Brown: And if I could just add to that, because Patrick, one of the things I've consistently said about the loan loss in our efforts there is that owner engagement is the tip of the spear, and it was later as early as this morning, we're just looking at trends on how our new owners are booking, how early they're booking, the level of first-year travel that we're seeing, and all of those signs are very positive, and what everyone knows about this industry and what we definitely know about Wyndham Vacation Clubs is the more people use their ownership the more satisfied they are and the less likely they are to default. So, I'm very bullish on what I'm seeing on our owner engagement initiatives.
Patrick Scholes: Okay, guys, thank you for the detailed answers. That's all.
Michael Brown: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Ian Zaffino with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Ian Zaffino: Hi, great. I also want to key in on sort of the loan loss provision. I guess, Mike, you kind of touched upon, I guess Wyndham Cares, is that the main driver of the decline in the loan loss provision? Is it more of maybe much say customer selection? Is it efforts going after third-parties? If you can kind of break it down a little bit deeper into what the drivers were? Thanks.
Michael Brown: Absolutely, let me start with just touching a little bit more on the owner and some underwriting, then I will hand it over to Mike here, but in the end, I absolutely believe that owner engagement is the start of where the loan loss reduction has occurred, and will continue to occur. We've been very clear that our long-term at least in the model is 20%, but we're not going to be satisfied with that percent. We want it to continue to get lower. And to the extent that we're driving incremental engagement, we think that's going to be the key driver in getting it down. We've got the -- we think we have best-in-class sales and marketing organization that's not just committed to incremental sales, but they're committed to working across the enterprise to what's best for not only the consumer, but also for the provision. And Mike and his team has worked with that sales and marketing organization to continue to refine underwriting, and throughout the year we've tested a new elements to our underwriting and what you've seen as it relates to cash flow is you've seen incremental down payments that have driven more cash flow, which has also helped the provision. Mike, do you want to…
Mike Hug: Yes, I mean a couple of other things, Mike mentioned the tighter underwriting standards, we did as we talked about in a second quarter put in place programs related to more underwriting on the larger loan balances, drive higher down payments. On the owner side, obviously the Wyndham Cares is a big piece of that, but I think more importantly things that they're using their points booking their vacations, continued improvements we're making to the reservation system to enhance search functionality, so that when they go in and search they get quicker returns in terms of the search they made as well as more options. So I think it's really a combination of all the things that all aspects of the organization are focused on, whether it's on the consumer finance side, on the sales and marketing, on the owner engagement with the reservations agent, I think it's just focused by the entire organization on making sure we're doing all the right things to get people on vacation and be smart about who we sell to and how much we financed them.
Ian Zaffino: Okay, thank you. And then just a follow-up would be -- I know you're not going to talk about 2020 until I guess February, unfortunately rental sales, I'd have to do some of our projections for 2020. As we look at the loan loss provision, is it right to maybe take the average of 2019 and project from there or is it better to use, let's just say this, this third and then even this fourth quarter number as kind of a baseline for projections given how quickly loan losses have come down throughout the year. I want to adjust from maybe seasonality, but, if you can kind of give us an idea of where we can maybe start as a baseline for our projections and then we get to do our own work and project from there.
Michael Brown: Ian, you really hit the two ways to look at this issue, and we've tried to communicate over the past year or so that the loan loss provision looking at a quarter-by-quarter is a lot more volatile than looking at it over time. So, earlier in the year when it was above whatever everyone's expectation, I think there was a lot of nervousness around that, and we said, don't worry, we have a fairly good outlook for the year, and this quarter we are -- I think we're pretty clearly below what everyone expected it to be, and we view it as a full-year look and we've been reaffirming all along this year 20.5%. I'd sort of reiterate what I said to Patrick, which is our modeling is that 20%, but we're not satisfied that 20% is where we want to be for the long haul, and as we're looking into next year, I would not look at individual quarters, I would look at our full-year projections, and then the fact that we're not going to be satisfied with our long-term modeling at 20%, and then we will be more precise when we get on the call in February.
Ian Zaffino: Okay, thanks. It seems like you're kind of hitting your stride with the customer engagement. So I just kind of wanted to capture that trend. All right, thank you very much. I'll let someone else ask the next question.
Michael Brown: Thank you, Ian.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Greff with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Omer Sander: Hey, good morning; Omer Sander on for Joe. You touched on it briefly, but on the new owner mix, how much of the negative variance was related to Dorian, in general, is it harder to grow new owner mix in seasonally stronger periods like the summer months or second quarter and third quarter and easier in the shorter periods, like the first or the fourth quarter?
Michael Brown: So, I'll touch a little bit on cadence and a little bit on Dorian. When you look at the new owner mix so far or this year on the second quarter call, we really talked about a slower ramp up with one of our marketing partners and a delay of opening of one as a reason that our new owner mix was down in the first quarter. Those are singular events, not a macroeconomic indication of what's going on with the consumer. We saw that happen. We knew that what's key to our strategy and core to it is that we want to grow new owners. So, credit to our marketing team, they really engaged knowing that was our key platform and they've driven 4% tour growth in the third quarter, and that's adjusted for hurricane Dorian. Had that been not adjusted and we got those tours back. We'd be right at the midpoint of our guidance of 6%, and you're going to see acceleration of new owner tours into the fourth quarter. So, when you look at where we are year-to-date, I would not put our new owner mixed down to anything other than we have over-performance on owner arrivals, we had some singular events in the second quarter, which we identified at the time, and the reaction from our organization to drive demand generators, i.e. tours has been very clear in the third quarter, and we expect it to continue in the fourth quarter. As it relates to cadence, actually the middle two months of the year or quarters of the year, the second, the third quarter tend to be our higher new owner mixed quarters, but when we look at the fourth quarter of this year, you should see an acceleration of new owner mix compared to that. So that's the answer to your question. I would just add one piece underneath all of that because that's the macro point of view on new owner mix. The underlying stat that I'm really encouraged by is it wasn't too long ago that when we were on the road, we talked about Blue Thread being 5% of our new owner sales mix. When we look at where we are that should represent about 10% this year of our new owner sales mix. It shows that those tours and that program, which we said was core to our strategy is continuing with its momentum, and we're very satisfied with the progress of that element of our new owner mix story.
Omer Sander: All right, thank you. And then your full year tour growth guidance of 5% to 7% implies pretty strong growth in the fourth quarter, like 10%, even to get to the lower end, how you generate that, and presumably there's a lot of new owner tours in there, which will impact VPG. So I guess the question is what should we be anticipating for VPG in the 4Q?
Michael Brown: Yes, you are right. As it relates to the growth in tour flow in the fourth quarter, a couple of things, recall last year when we had our call, we did have some drop in new owner tour flow in the third and fourth quarters, conscious decisions on our part, here in internationally to eliminate some new owner tour sources because we didn't feel like they were the right long-term program. So, most of the growth year-over-year is driven by the fact that the base was a little bit lower as well as the fact that as we talked about in the second quarter, we did have a tour provider who was a little late in terms of generating the committed number of tours. We have opened a couple of sales offices over the course of the last two quarters. So, it's driven by artificially low base, if you will, as well as the right things happening with new sales offices and the tour flow generation. And we did mention in our comments that as you would expect as the tour flow growth goes up in the fourth quarter and the fact that a lot at tour flow is new owners tours, you should see a drop in VPG on a year-over-year basis.
Omer Sander: Okay, awesome. And if I could sneak in one last one, buybacks accelerated nicely in the 3Q, so it's 90 million per quarter the new kind of $60 million rate?
Mike Hug: Well, I mean, we don't provide guidance on our future share repurchases. I think what I would say is if you look at our history throughout each quarter this year, we have continued to increase that, as I talked about already, as we're doing things to drive more cash, we have put that to work in, return it to shareholders through higher share repurchases.
Omer Sander: Thanks guys.
Mike Hug: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Dobson with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.
Brian Dobson: Hey, good morning. So just quickly touching on the exchange business, again, the acquisition of Alliance Reservation, I guess, how far are you looking to take that business in terms of vacation services, are you looking to turn that into a full service, one stop shop for your closed user group, or do you think that you'll stay focused more on the timeshare aspect?
Michael Brown: Yes, it's a little bit of yes and yes. The core reason to make that acquisition was to support our core business of timeshare exchange, and it's the reason we started with and I think it's more flexibility and easier transaction for timeshare exchange members, and as a reminder, we have 4 million members within RCI. What it opens the door to and what we will speak more to in probably our next call or the one after that is the long-term strategy for ARN. We've made the acquisition. The team's hard at work in the transition. They are integrating the business and for providing more options for the members and more services for our developer affiliates. Once we have that solidified, we will definitely buy and turn toward the broader travel and tourism space and see what opportunities lie there, but we want to get step one taken care of first, but I can assure you the team is already looking at what we believe step two is going to be.
Brian Dobson: That's exciting. All right, thanks a lot.
Michael Brown: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Stephen Grambling: Hi, thanks. One follow-up on the VPG comments, I guess, can you just walk us again through some of the puts and takes within the quarter? I guess as new owner sales came down as a part of the mix. I would have thought that, that would have been an offset to VPG pressure. So anything you can talk to in terms of maybe even VPG news -- new owners are you seeing any difference in trend by the cohort? Thanks.
Michael Brown: Good morning, Stephen. This is Michael. I'll take that. A few things, first of all, there's really two components of that VPG in the third quarter, and there's obviously a mixed component, but really, Stephen, as you move from where we were in the first-half of this year on our tour growth, which, as we said on the second quarter call was muted, and we've begun to ramp it up. We've ramped it up from a marketing standpoint, and we continue to do so in the fourth quarter, and there is a little bit of inefficiency that comes with that. Your closed rates get affected modestly, and when I say modestly, there is nothing that give us any reason for concern or nothing that would indicate that there's any macroeconomic issue, and I keep referring to that because I think it's fair to say over the last 12 months, everyone is looking for cracks in the consumer. We're just not seeing it. This is a normal cadence to the timeshare business. In the fourth quarter of last year, we were looking for weakness in the consumer because our new owner tours were down. In the third quarter of this year, as we've ramped backup our new owner tours to recover from what was a little bit of softness in the first-half of this year, which we've talked about, is it now VPG that's the concern. I don't view it that way at all. I think this is normal cadence of the business. If you're looking at the football analogy, a football analogy we went into the year with a very clear playbook, we got into the second quarter, we saw that we needed to call a few audibles, and for us, the core strategy is to win the long-term EBITDA, EPS, cash flow, and new owner towards generation. Strategy, so as we ended Q2, we said, "Look, even if we struggle a little bit on VPG, it's important we continue to drive these tours for our long-term new owner growth." We've done exactly that. We've suffered a little bit on VPG, but keep in mind, the first-half of this year, we were right at the midpoint of our VPG growth, and I would say very specifically in the third quarter, and you'll see it in the fourth quarter. The VPG softness is around our ramp of new owner tours, which is right where we want to be for our long-term new owner strategy. Keep in mind this year…
Stephen Grambling: Got it.
Michael Brown: -- I'm Sorry, just one last thing, Stephen, and then we'll come right back to you is that keep in mind this year that even though that we've talked about a little bit of softness in our tours in the first-half of this year, we've generated 29,000 new owners through the end of the first nine months. So we're very pleased with that. So, sorry, Stephen, I did cut you off, I apologize…
Stephen Grambling: No, that's all helpful, thanks so much. I have other follow-up, so on the provision coming down, I guess, what's the typical recapture and resale timeframe? So as you had provision step-up, and you were recapturing inventory, I imagine some of that, when was that inventory being sold flowing through in terms of product costs, and should that continue, that inventory continue to be sold, is that impacting this year, is that next year as well? Any color you can provide?
Mike Hug: Yes, good question, Stephen. This is Mike Hug. On the inventory recovery, I would say on a year-over-year basis it's probably going to be pretty comparable. It really depends on the inventory, the points-based product, the foreclosure process is very quick, and that's the area that these product that's a little bit longer, but when you look on a year-over-year basis, I wouldn't expect a significant movement in our cost of sales as a result of the time of the recovery of the inventory.
Stephen Grambling: Great, thanks so much.
Mike Hug: Sure.
Operator: Our final question today comes from Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Jared Shojaian: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question.
Mike Hug: Good morning, Jared.
Jared Shojaian: Good morning. I want to ask you about your companywide margins, because there is kind of an interesting trend of developed -- your margins are expanding during periods where your new owner sales mix is growing, and then conversely, they're contracting when your new owner sales mix is declining. Historically, that's not the type of relationship I would expect. So, can you talk about that, and maybe tell us what the difference in the margin profile is between a new owner and an existing owner? I would imagine the actual development margin is a lot lower with the new owner, but maybe more going to take the financing and ultimately drive the entire margin up. So, can you just talk about a little bit?
Mike Hug: Sure. I appreciate the question. As it relates to margin from quarter-to-quarter, I think it's important to understand as we talked about in the third quarter, our margins were definitely impacted by a higher cost of sales. And then also to a certain degree, the hurricane, even though we have account for the lost revenue, it's important to understand that we do continue to pay our sales and marketing people even if they are in markets, where there's no third generation during the period of the hurricanes. So, third quarter is too low, driven by those two factors, as we've talked about. That's one of the big reasons when you look at the fourth quarter, a big cost of sales benefit coming through, as well as the provision, which will help drive the fourth quarter profitability and the margin. So, once again, when we look at margins, we're managing the full-year third quarter outlier because of the cost of sales and the hurricane. In terms of profitability, between the two, year-end margins that are 1.5 to 2 times higher on the upgrade sale, primarily driven by the marketing costs and the higher VPG, those are basically trends that have been pretty consistent throughout the business.
Jared Shojaian: Okay, thank you. And then, Michael, I just want to go back to your prior comments on consumer trends, because it seemed like looking at your results, hearing what you're saying, overall trends within the industry and your business remain quite healthy. And a lot of the macro data, particularly in recent months, and some of these we heard from the hotel companies so far and just looking at the RevPAR data doesn't exactly reconcile with that. So, can you talk about that disconnect and maybe speak to how you think this illustrates the resiliency of the timeshare models?
Michael Brown: Well, Jared, I'd actually -- maybe I should let you say it, because we believe it very, very strongly, and I think what you're saying is exactly on point. People going on vacation, even when you go back to 2008 and 2009, you still have people going on vacation, and we very much believe this will remain a very resilient business in the downturns. Look, we definitely are watching the macro environment. We know manufacturing is extremely soft. September retail sales were not as strong as anyone would have expected, but the reality is that when you look at overall leisure travel, you look at what we view as our proxies, and we look at employments in Orlando, Vegas, Nashville, Austin, they're all up high single-digits, low double-digits, and we're seeing that leisure travel like that itself continues to stay strong in the macroeconomic environment, and when you combine that with a business model that that is demand generation, we are a direct sales and marketing organization, and in good times to bad, there are going to be 70 million to 80 million people in Orlando. Sorry, in good times, there'll be 80 million arrivals this year and bad times it'll be 72 million. That is plenty population, and when we are actively out there driving that demand in direct marketing, we can still be successful, resilient, generate cash flow, we will accept modulating metrics along the way, but the business model itself is very strong. If a downturn occurs in the Q1 of next year or Q1 of the following year, we are not relying on a corporation to book group business into our properties. 80% of our owners already fully own their timeshare, and they are going to go on vacation and they are going to be in the units, and the people who don't own with us are already in the markets and we do a lot of our direct marketing in markets. So I think your statement is absolutely spot on, is it is a little counterintuitive to big ticket item discretionary. The reality is as people view their vacations as not discretionary, and one of the last things they are going to give up in any type of softness or even in fact a downturn.
Jared Shojaian: Great, thank you very much. And if I could just sneak one more in just on M&A, obviously, you acquired ARN which is sort of a smaller tuck-in kind of acquisition, but do you have any desire for much bigger larger scale M&A? And if so, is there any initial leverage level that you would be comfortable dialing up to?
Michael Brown: Absolutely happy to take that question, the answer to that we would give is the answer that we gave 12 months ago. We absolutely believe in our core organic strategy. We think the ability to grow our business even at its size to have top line and bottom line growth in the mid single-digits generate 55% to 60% cash flow is a business model we are super happy with, and jumping back to David's question is at today share price and our ability to generate cash, we are going to take advantage of that as much as we can. With that said, we have, we do, and we will continue to look at the entire travel and tourism landscape and look at any opportunity that's out there that would be accretive to the business and great for shareholders, we have always done that, and we will continue to do that. And our answer as far as leverage is the same answer we have been giving out there. We would go up on leverage to do the right transaction, but we would not -– but there is an upper limit, and we would consider it as part of an overall strategic opportunity that would be accretive to shareholders.
Jared Shojaian: All right.
Michael Brown: Thank you, Jared.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period. I'd now like to turn the call back to Michael Brown for closing remarks.
Michael Brown: Thank you for that, and I would like to close by just reiterating how pleased I was with our team's execution and the overall results in the third quarter, but I would definitely be remiss if I didn't put a special thank you out there to our North American rentals team. This transaction was a great one not only for the Vacasa, the acquirer, but also for Wyndham Destinations, the seller. I think both companies will benefit greatly from the sale, and the team that delivered that led by Marilyn, Mike, and Kevin, they represented a great team of individuals who delivered a great result for the company -- for both companies, and I would like to put a special thank you out to them. I am super pleased with the third quarter, excited on how we are looking to finish the year, and look forward to our next call in a few months. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes today's third quarter 2019 Wyndham Destinations earnings conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-30 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Wyndham Destinations’ Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference call is being recorded. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Chris Agnew. Please go ahead. 
Chris Agnew: Thanks Keith. Good morning and welcome. Before we begin, we’d like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, and the forward-looking statements made today are effective only as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in our SEC filings. And you can find a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in today’s call and our earnings press release on our website at investor.wyndhamdestinations.com. This morning, Michael Brown, our President and Chief Executive Officer will provide an overview on our strategic initiatives and our second quarter results. And Mike Hug, our Chief Financial Officer, will then provide greater detail on our results and discuss our outlook. Following these remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions. With that, I am pleased to turn the call over to Michael Brown.
Michael Brown: Thank you, Chris. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. As we celebrate our one year anniversary, this call marks our fourth as Wyndham Destinations. We are proud of the progress made since the spin was announced in 2017 and the accomplishments achieved in our first year as a public company. The progress confirms that we are executing our strategy to put owners and members on great vacations to deliver mid-single-digit organic growth to generate strong and consistent free cash flow and to return significant capital to shareholders. On this last point, we have now returned $585 million in capital to shareholders since the spin in June of 2018. Earlier this morning, Wyndham Destinations reported another strong quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $255 million and adjusted EPS of $1.45. EPS was above our guidance range and 16% higher than the prior year.  We were pleased with our operating performance in particular the strength in owner arrivals, the growth of Blue Thread sales and the year-over-year and sequential improvement in our loan loss provision rate. We are increasing our full year outlook for adjusted free cash flow to a range of $555 million to $575 million. And we are also increasing our adjusted EPS guidance range to $5.38 to $5.58. Our new EPS range represents 13% year-over-year growth at the midpoint and we are reaffirming our outlook for full year adjusted EBITDA guidance of $995 million to $1,015 million. As we announced this morning, we concluded our strategic review of Wyndham Vacation Rentals. The sale of this business to Vacasa for $162 million is expected to close in the fall. We believe Vacasa is the ideal buyer of the business and as a result we will receive a small equity interest in their company as part of the transaction. The sale will be comprised of $45 million cash at closing, up to $30 million of Vacasa equity and the remaining balance at either seller financing or cash at closing. As we previously discussed, the rationale for the strategic review was to allow a dedicated focus on growth in our core business of vacation ownership and exchange. Our strong financial performance this quarter was a result of solid gross VOI sales growth of 4% in total and 5% in North America. We also benefited from increased owner engagement which delivered significantly higher owner arrivals and increased owner sales. Furthering their performance in the second quarter was a slightly better than expected loan loss provision and consistent RCI performance. Let me now turn to discuss the provision. I continued to believe we are making all the right decisions to reduce loan loss provisions for the long term. This quarter affirms that fact and although this is not best measured quarter-to-quarter, our full year guidance demonstrates the progress we are making. You have heard me discuss at length the importance of owner engagements. Our numerous efforts have led to second quarter net occupancy being 400 basis points higher than the prior year and also resulted in an increase of 17,000 owner arrivals in our North American resorts. This is on the back of 13,000 more arrivals in the first quarter.  We also saw excellent performance in our Blue Thread initiatives this quarter. Sales volume increased 50% year-over-year driven by a 37% increase in tour flow. Year-to-date, Blue Thread sales are 33% higher than prior year. Speaking more broadly about total tour flow, tours increased 3% in the quarter over the prior year and 4% in North America. Tour flow has been slightly lighter in the first half due to a delay in our new Nashville sales site and intentional change to our international tour mix which we began in the fourth quarter of 2018 and under-performance from one of our marketing partners. These are finite impacts as we have since opened Nashville, we will lap international mix issues in the fourth quarter and we are working closely with our marketing partner to realign tour flow expectations. We are confident that growth will accelerate in the second half and we are now likely towards the lower half of the 5% to 7% growth that we guided for the full year. One of the outcomes from stronger owner arrivals and sales is a natural reduction in our new owner sales mix as a percent of total sales. We expect new owner sales to be up year-over-year and over a two-year period that being 2018 and 2019. We expect new owner sales mix to increase 300 basis points. We continue to see strong sales at Gen Xers and Millennials, which combined for 62% of our second quarter new owner sales. This represented an increase of 500 basis points from the prior year.  One of the strategies we have in place to continue to attract new owners is to establish more distinctly each of our Vacation Clubs brand identities. Powerful brands deliver great development opportunities, but they also drive increased owner engagement. At the end of May, we launched new brand identities with an exciting modern look and feel that brings the essence of being an owner to life for our flagship timeshare clubs, Club Wyndham and WorldMark by Wyndham. We have refreshed the brands through a lens that appeals to our owners at every touch point across their life cycle from both accretive and digital perspective. The tagline for Club Wyndham is live your bucket list and speaks to how the brand is now – it’s not just about owning a timeshare, it connects owner’s passions for travel with exciting new destinations. For WorldMark owners, vacation serve as the backdrop for ongoing traditions and the catalyst to create new ones, which leads to the brand’s tagline of more time to share.  In fact, I recently attended the grand opening of our WorldMark by Wyndham in Portland, Oregon and had the opportunity to speak directly with our owners. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive. We are the first timeshare company in this urban market and it was great for us to see the new branding comes to life at this location. These brand changes along with the CRM initiatives we discussed on the first quarter call; we’ll continue to enhance our owner engagement efforts. In exchange and rentals, the announcement of the sale of Wyndham Vacation Rentals was a key initiative and I would like to thank everyone on our team who worked on the strategic review of the business. We are also making tremendous strides on the exchange side of our business. RCI is investing as part of its existing capital plan and supply and technology enhancements that focus on improving the member experience. Several initiatives have taken hold with more to come in the second half of the year. In addition, RCI continues to look for new options for its members and in the second quarter added 21 new affiliates or 42 new properties to its destination portfolio.  Lastly, with regard to capital allocation, we continue to demonstrate our commitment to returning cash to shareholders with $240 million in dividends and share repurchases year-to-date through the end of July. Our capital allocation outlook remains the same. We are committed to our quarterly dividend, which expresses confidence in our ability to consistently generate free cash flow and in the absence of compelling transactions we believe the best use of excess free cash flow remains share repurchases. To conclude, I’d like to reinforce three major takeaways from our second quarter. First the quarter delivered very tangible results around increase owner engagement. Second, the announcement to sell Wyndham Vacation Rentals highlights our focus on optimizing our balance sheet and driving incremental free cash flow. Lastly, regarding our outlook for the full year, we are reaffirming our adjusted EBITDA guidance and increasing adjusted EPS and adjusted free cash flow guidance. With that, I would like to hand the call over to Mike Hug. Mike?
Mike Hug: Thank you, Michael and good morning everyone. Today, I’d like to discuss our second quarter results and our 2019 outlook. My comments will be primarily focused on our adjusted results. You can find our complete results in our earnings release including reconciliations of adjusted and further adjusted amounts to GAAP numbers. Our second quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $1.45, an increase of 16% over the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $255 million, an increase of 2% over the prior year and adjusted EBITDA margin was 24.5% in the quarter. Year-to-date, our adjusted EBITDA increased 3% and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 20 basis points over the prior year. Adjusted EPS increased 19% in the first half over the prior year. Second quarter gross VOI sales increased 4% year-over-year to $626 million with a 3% increase in tours and a 1% increase in VPG. Adjusted EBITDA growth of 3% in our vacation ownership segment was driven by net revenue growth of 5% partially offset by higher marketing costs. On a rate basis, marketing costs slightly increased as a ramp up in tours lag increased and fixed costs associated with certain marketing channels. As Michael mentioned, we expect tour growth to accelerate in the second half of the year. The provision for loan loss as a percentage of gross VOI sales improved sequentially and year-over-year to 21.2% in the second quarter. Our gross receivables portfolio increased 5% year-over-year to $3.8 billion and our provision for loan loss increased $3 million over the prior year with the entire increase attributable to higher VOI sales. We remain confident in the actions we are taking to continue to reduce the provision and we expect sequential improvement in the second half of the year allowing us to achieve our guidance of around 20.5% for the full year. Exchange and rental revenue decreased 3% in the quarter due to decrease in revenue per member, partially offset by member growth. Adjusted EBITDA increased 3% over the prior year due to lower G&A expense. The decline in revenue per member continues to be driven largely by member mix, lower other product revenue and inventory supply challenges. Although revenue per member continues to be down, we saw sequential improvement in the year-over-year trend in the first half of 2019 compared to the second half of last year. We expect continued improvement in this trend for the remainder of 2019 and going forward as a result of some of the initiatives Michael mentioned. Our adjusted free cash flow from continuing operations for the first half of 2019 was $298 million versus $195 million in the first half of 2018. We are confident in our outlook for free cash flow this year with two additional securitizations, one in the third quarter and one in the fourth quarter. Last week, we completed the third quarter securitization, a $450 million transaction with weighted average coupon of 2.96% and advance rate of 98%. Based on investor demand, the transaction size was upsized by $50 million. We were very pleased with this execution, which was multiple times oversubscribed. This transaction confirms again our proven track record of being able to access the ABS markets.  Turning to our balance sheet, as of June 30, we had $257 million of cash and cash equivalents with corporate debt at $3.1 billion which excludes $2.4 billion of nonrecourse debt related to our securitized receivables. With our net leverage at 2.9 times within our targeted leverage of 2.25 to 3 times, our capital allocation remained consistent in the second quarter. The increase in leverage was expected with the second quarter being our lowest free cash flow quarter and with the payments related to the sale of the European vacation rentals business that we identified on our first quarter call. By the end of the year, we anticipate the net leverage will be around 2.8 times. We declared a cash dividend at $0.45 per share on May 16, which was paid to shareholders on June 28. And as Michael mentioned, we continued with share repurchases in the second quarter. We bought back $65 million of stock at a weighted average price of $42.74 per share for a total of 1.5 million shares. In the month of July, we continued with share repurchases of $30 million. Now let me turn to our outlook for the remainder of the year. We are reaffirming adjusted EBIDTA guidance to be in the range of $995 million to $1,015 million. We are increasing our outlook for adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations to range of $5.38 to $5.58 from $5.21 to $5.42, primarily on lower interest expense and share count.  As a reminder, our outlook for diluted EPS is based on a diluted share count of 93.4 million shares, which assumes no further share repurchases after June 30, 2019. For the third quarter of 2019, we expect adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations to range from $1.46 to $1.54.  A couple of items to call out on the third quarter. First, our third quarter cost of sales will be 250 basis points higher year-over-year driven by higher cost inventory that we are selling in the third quarter. The higher cost inventory was expected and will negatively impact third quarter adjusted EBITDA by approximately $17 million and adjusted EPS by approximately $0.13. For the full year, the more expensive third quarter inventory will be offset by lower product cost in the fourth quarter. Second, we expect the loan loss provision will be down sequentially again in the third quarter and similar to the prior year.  For adjusted free cash flow, we are increasing our guidance to $555 million to $575 million, $15 million higher than the prior guidance range. With respect to our key drivers for the full year, we expect VPG to increase in the range of 1% to 3% and we now expect tours to be at the lower end of our 5% to 7% range. For the exchange and rentals business, we continue to believe average number of members will be flat to up 2% and revenue per member will be flat to down 2%. To conclude, we are very pleased with our performance in the second quarter. Our improved outlook for full year EPS growth of 13% at the mid point and our continued strong free cash flow. Mike and I are extremely proud of our associates and leaders who have continued to do a stellar job executing on a fundamental operating strategy. With that, we would like to turn the call back to Keith and open it up for questions 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. We’ll take our first question from David Katz with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
David Katz: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Michael Brown: Good morning, David.
David Katz: I wanted to ask, the one of the questions that hangs on us is we see the securitization terms and obviously what that investor base thinks of the business and how it thinks about the business relative to where we see the equity, which is I think most would agree is trading at a low-ish multiple. From your preview and the feedback that you are getting, how do we reconcile that difference, right? Because one continues to improve the values it sees in the business and the other has been on a stable or flattish?
Michael Brown: David, it’s a great question, one we seem to hear more and more recently as we get a little further away from the separation. We have just completed our first year and as we came out, the reality is, we are a new management team without a track record in the public markets as Wyndham Destinations. As we came public, I think there was a single mid-digit growth and generating free cash flow, we’re returning cash to shareholders. And I think every quarter that goes by that consistent unchanging approach is getting recognized and being appreciated. So I do think the delta between where the debt markets and where the equity markets see us, we believe we’ll continue to close as we continue to deliver our core strategy which again and I think the second quarter really proves it, returning capital to shareholders.
David Katz: All right. And then as my follow-up with respect to Vacasa, I hope I’m pronouncing that correctly, and that’s the essence of my question is I’m not familiar with them. What can you tell us about sort of who they are and where they came from and obviously we hear your enthusiasm about it. How big a population was thereof, parties interested in this business? And how competitive was it? I guess that’s a whole bunch of follow-ups in there, but we’d love to hear about that deal?
Michael Brown: There is a lot there. Let me start, it was a very robust process with a lot of interest both from strategics and private equity. But in the end, North American rentals came with Wyndham Destinations because number one, we believed in the business. And number two, we saw some strategic opportunities that the vacation ownership and exchange business could leverage by having North America rentals inside of Wyndham Destinations. As we went through the strategic review, we felt that we could retain a lot of that strategic relationship as Vacasa takes over ownership and one of the major reasons we wanted to continue to have an equity stake. Vacasa is a great company. It’s been in business for a decade now and has been a strategic in this space with expertise and really technology driven revenue generation. They do a phenomenal job on the demand side of the equation. They’ve got great scale and this only adds to the strength of what I consider as I’ve got to know their management team, their business model and their direction for the future, as we are the industry leader in vacation ownership and exchange. We believe Vacasa is the right buyer because we believe that they are the right leader for the vacation rental space and have done a great job over the last decade building their model and growing it and putting themselves in a position to make this type of transaction.
David Katz: Got it. Thank you very much.
Michael Brown: Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Chris Woronka: Hey, good morning guys.
Michael Brown: Good morning.
Mike Hug: Chris, good morning.
Chris Woronka: Hey, good morning. Question for – and I know you mentioned that the – one of the factors going to impact the new owner mix this year is the international side of things and how you’re going to kind of remix that business. Can you maybe tell us a little bit about profitability of the international, guests versus your domestic guests?
Michael Brown: Sure. I’ll take that. This is Michael. In the fourth quarter of last year, no different than we do in North America. We looked at our marketing channels and found that a number of our new owner marketing channels were not creating profitability, and made the decision at that point. And I remember we had questions on the fourth quarter call around tour flow in the fourth quarter. We made the decision that we were better off limiting our marketing channels and focusing on more profitable marketing operations in the international arena. That’s why I said we will lap that decision in October of last year in this fourth quarter. As far as VOI margins between international and domestic, they are pretty much the same, Chris. And if I can scale the operation, we do about 10% of our sales internationally and 90% in North America. And that 10% really is in the South Pacific between Australia and our New Zealand operations and more recently we’ve ventured up into Thailand. So about 10% of our mix is in international and it’s primarily in those countries. 
Chris Woronka: Okay. Very helpful. Thanks. And then my follow-up would be on the – now that you are exiting the Vacation Rentals business, can you maybe tell us a little bit about, how that maybe reenergizes the growth profile of the exchange business and maybe kind of going along with that. How you look at, I know we don’t have maybe the exact EBITDA and growth rates from the two combined businesses, but how you think maybe that can improve the growth profile at the – on the exchange side?
Michael Brown: Absolutely. And I do want to come back to the answer I gave to David just a second ago is, although we are exiting the business, we are retaining an equity stake in Vacasa and it comes back to what we believe in that business, number one. But number two is, I think there’s a lot of strategic relationship opportunities that we can have with Vacasa, both in our Vacation Clubs and exchange business that warrants both of us staying very engaged together to help grow each other’s business mutually. So that’s – I just wanted to clarify that. Secondly is, what does it do for our remaining business? It really allows us to stay focused on the vacation ownership and exchange business. The rental business was not core and brought with it lower margin. So for us it’s an ability to secure the promise that we made about retaining if not growing margins in the long haul. This transaction allows us to: a) keep a strategic relationship; b) generate cash flow; c) focus on our core business; and then lastly, make sure that our reinvestment back into the business, will help re-energize the exchange business. I'm very pleased with the progress that we're seeing on the RCI side. And feel that the projections we've laid out for the remainder of this year really should play out and feel they are headed in the right direction with our new initiatives.
Chris Woronka: Okay. Very good. Thanks Mike. 
Michael Brown: Chris, I appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question is from Patrick Scholes for SunTrust Bank. Please go ahead
Patrick Scholes: Hi, good morning Mike and Mike.
Michael Brown: Thanks Patrick.
Patrick Scholes: Thank you. A question for you, the other day I heard, I think, it was ESPN Radio, actually a advertisement from you folks. I don't ever recall hearing a timeshare company advertising there on the radio obviously, we only hear the third party companies. I'm wondering what sort of feedback have you gotten from that. What's the intention on that, is it to drive sales or is it to counter some of these third-party advertisements? And then is that something that would be I assume including in that higher marketing costs that you've talked about? Thanks.
Michael Brown: Patrick, the short answer on your last question is no, it's not part of the incremental spend. We have made a commitment as we've talked about, is having a stronger, more positive, narrative around not only the industry, but our place in the industry. The reality of ownership is that the satisfaction rates, as we've talked about many times, is very high. The churn in our owner base is extremely low. You’ve heard me mention before 700,000 of our 880,000 owners are fully paid off with their ownership and enjoying great vacations for the price of a maintenance fee. And we've been less than proactive in sharing the good news and making people proud of their ownership. Richard Petty has been an owner with us for a long time, has a very strong appeal with a lot of people. And this was not a sales presentation or a really a marketing, it was simply general awareness, positivity and talking about the virtues and the benefits of vacation ownership. He's been a strong endorser of our product along with many other individuals. But I think it's long overdue that we’re more vocal in expressing the positive nature of timeshare in the general marketplace so that you can hear not only a certain type of advertisement, but some real positive messaging.
Patrick Scholes: Okay. Thank you.
Michael Brown: Thanks Patrick.
Operator: Our next question is from Joe Greff with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. 
Joe Greff: Good morning guys. On the increased adjusted free cash flow guidance for full year 2019, it looks like some of it's from lower interest expense. Can you allocate how much is coming from other sources?
Mike Hug: Yes, I think when we look at our adjusted free cash flow obviously we're very happy with the benefit we received as relates to both the securitization, the improvement in interest expense and some opportunities that we’ve taken advantage of on the working capital side of the business. I think it was a combination of those three things that really gave us the confidence in raising the guidance of the cash flow midpoint by $15 million.
Joe Greff: Got it. And just to clarify, since I'm out of pocket here, your EBITDA guidance was reaffirmed for the year. How much of that EBITDA relates to what you're selling here this morning? I believe last year, maybe last quarter, you said something in the neighborhood of $10 million of EBITDA. What is it in terms of revenues as well? 
Mike Hug: Yes, I think, what we plan to do is obviously the full year financial impact resulting from the sale will be driven in part by when the transaction closes and the proceed is received. So we would expect after the closing that transaction to come out with more details as it relates to the financial impact on the year from the sale – of the North America rental business.
Joe Greff: Okay, great. And then my final question, of the $162 million sales price, $45 million is going to be cash at closing the $30 million of equity or up to $30 million of equity and then the balance of it, either cash or you're providing financing. What's the determinant for the balance of that that $87 million, either your financing or Vacasa finds other sources to close the transaction for the remaining balance? 
Michael Brown: This is Michael. Let me just take that one. Vacasa is going to be going to market for a fundraise very soon and has done and been successful with a number of previous raises. For those following the space, there's already been a significant amount of capital raised in this sector over the last several months. And with Vacasabeing the market leader we feel good about their opportunity to get into the market with the successful fundraise. The structure that's laid out was simply put in place to provide some flexibility for closing depending on market conditions.
Joe Greff: Okay, great. And then one final question. Just going back to the adjusted EBITDA guidance being reaffirmed, did you actually net-net raise it from with some impact rather from the sale of vacation rentals? Or everything is in there for the full year not since that’s coming out for a close in the fall?
Michael Brown: Yes all of the guidance that we’ve provided today assumes the North America rental business remains with us for the entire year. Obviously the transaction will close sometimes in the fall and at that point we will update the guidance as it relates to EBITDA and cash flow for the year.
Joe Greff: Great. Thanks guys.
Michael Brown: Sure.
Operator: Our next question is from Ian Zaffino with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. 
Ian Zaffino: Hi, great, thanks. Can you guys just touch on what you are seeing on the ground from the consumer? Also tour volumes, I guess you said you're going to be kind of the low end. What's driving that? Is that a cautious decision? Is that something that you're seeing for the consumer out there, or just try and give us a little color there? Thank you.
Michael Brown: Ian, I appreciate it. This is Mike Brown. Really there's no change that we're seeing on a consumer standpoint, traffic into the major markets remain strong. We're obviously very much closing second quarter reports on a macro basis and see very consistent evidence that the consumer remains strong. Specifically it's why we wanted to call out a little bit of detail what we saw in the second quarter. Those were very finite issues. As I mentioned, Nashville, we had a slight delay in opening that specific sales site, our first location in downtown Nashville. We remained with a little bit of headwind over the international tour mix. But we have a lot of marketing partners it's one of the natures of our very diversified marketing platform. And we had a reliance on one of them to ramp their tour flow in the first half of this year. They're simply behind on their ramp. A little bit more than what showed in our softness, but the strength of our Blue Thread, the strength of our owner arrivals really helped to mitigate that. And obviously we're working with the partner, to help them ramp their tour flows. So all of that's been taken into account for the second half of this year, but nothing macro that's causing, what you saw. And again it was only one percentage point in the second quarter because our North American tour flow was 4% up year-on-year. 
Ian Zaffino: Okay, thanks. And then also I know you guys talk about the channels where you're getting a lot of the leads and Caesars is always one you mentioned. And I guess there's a change of ownership there. Can you maybe touch on what we should expect from that relationship?
Michael Brown: We have a long and very mutually beneficial relationship with Caesars. And the reason is because we create value for them and vice versa. We have had conversations, I would not expect any change in that relationship and we're hopeful that we can even grow it with a new ownership.
Ian Zaffino: Okay, thank you very much. 
Michael Brown: Thank you, Ian. 
Operator: Our next question is from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Stephen Grambling: Hey, thanks. So on vacation, how do you think about the use of proceeds from the rental sales similar or different than the cash generated from the core business? I think you mentioned in your opening remarks the dearth of opportunities for acquisitions. Is that driven by where your stock is, assets on the market or seller expectations?
Mike Hug: So good morning, Stephen, this is Mike Hug. Thanks for the question. I'll take the first part as it relates to the use of the cash that we'll receive and then Mike will talk a little about the M&A activity. When we think about the cash that's received, I think, we've demonstrated that absent any M&A opportunities out there, the best use of our cash is returned to shareholders through increasing the dividend as we did already this year or share repurchases. So once again, absent any M&A opportunities, I would expect that excess cash received from the sale of the North American rental business will be used in ways that are consistent with what we've done since June 1 of last year.
Michael Brown: And I'll just touch on the M&A side. No different from our previous stances we are always going to be looking for the right M&A opportunity if it's there and is a better use than share repurchases. What I would say is we are very conscious in watching the economic cycle. Opportunities seem to be better when there is a downturn. And we believe very much in the consistency of our free cash flow generation and the resiliency during a downturn. We think opportunities will continue to get better and better depending on where the ultimate economic cycle goes. But we will continue to evaluate if there's any either tuck in or midsize M&A that would support the growth of vacation clubs or the exchange side of the business.
Stephen Grambling: And I guess as a follow-up, changing gears to the loan loss provision, I guess what are the big factors that will dictate how quickly that provision comes down and how should we interpret the write-offs ticking up a bit on an absolute basis and as a percentage of financing receivables?
Mike Hug: So a couple of things there, as it relates to the write-offs, two things: one, our portfolio has grown, so you would expect that that the write-offs would grow. In addition, we had expected higher write-offs, which is why we've been providing at a higher rate over the last year or two because of the trends we're seeing so that the higher write-offs are not a surprise to us. And I would also point out that the increase in the write-offs in the second quarter of the year were actually lower than the increase in the write-offs year-over-year in the first quarter. So, we feel that the changes that we are making are benefiting the portfolio and the drivers of those benefits are really several things. First of all, as we talked about in that previous call, higher down payments and being – taking a good look at the underwriting standards that we have in place and tightening those up. So we institute those changes in the second quarter, which means we didn't get any benefit in the first quarter of the year and only a partial benefit in the second quarter. So through the second half of the year as those changes continue to take hold those will really be the key drivers to the sequential improvement in our provision in the second half of the year.
Stephen Grambling: Got it. And so just to be clear, the provision then should lead the write-off trajectory?
Mike Hug: Yes, I think, that's right. I mean once again the trends when we look at our loss curves would indicate right that losses were going up, which is why we would have provided a higher rate. And then as the provision comes down over time, keep in mind the life of portfolio is on average seven years so we would expect that as the provision comes down in the future we would see lower defaults. But once again that's a seven-year portfolio. I wouldn't expect lower defaults in the second half of this year on a year-over-year basis.
Stephen Grambling: Thank you. I'll jump back in queue.
Operator: Our next question is from Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. 
Jared Shojaian: Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So just sticking with that same line of questioning here, recently we've seen perhaps some more tangible evidence of your pushback against the third party firms with some of the recent court rulings and bankruptcies. Is that enough to move the needle on write-offs? And do you think you've seen any tangible evidence of maybe some reduction from some of the third party issues that you've been facing?
Michael Brown: Jared, litigation is not our core strategy. When we talk about our overall effort regarding the portfolio and the loan loss provision, it always starts with our owner engagement. We talk about owner engagement, presence on digital and social media and the Internet, continuing to refine our underwriting, as you mentioned, litigation and then lastly, support of consumer advocacy legislation and regulation. To me the key is the owner engagement piece, we're seeing tangible evidence of greater utilization, not only in the form of the owner rivals that we mentioned as part of the prepared remarks, but we're seeing a sharp increase in our reservations immediately after purchase. Our contact rates are significantly up. And you've heard me discuss over the last few years, the discussion around Wyndham Cares and our Ovation program. So, yes litigation is the right thing to do when we see either the consumer or our company being disinformation about us, or misinformation about us, or harm being done to the consumer, we will litigate. But that is not our core strategy. It really is around the owner engagement piece and we're seeing tangible evidence of improvements in the engagement metrics.
Jared Shojaian: Got it, thank you. And then just switching gears here, Mike, you said the tour is likely coming in towards the lower end of the range for the full year. You kept the EBITDA guidance unchanged. Were there other offsets that you would call out there, or is it just not really enough to move the needle?
Mike Hug: No, it's not really enough to move the needle. And obviously we're focused on achieving our full year numbers. So as we've talked about if we do have a slight miss as it relates to tours, we can definitely do the things that we need to do to make sure that we hit the EBITDA number for the year. So it's just making sure that we are looking at the organization on an overall basis and finding the right places to cover any shortfalls that we might have if we end up at the lower end of the tour range.
Jared Shojaian: Great, thank you. And just two quick housekeeping items if I may. Is your expectation that you're still going to be at about the 40% range for the full year on new owner sales mix? And then on the provision, I think, you said the third quarter provision rate would be similar year-over-year. Is the assumption that the fourth quarter is also going to be similar year-over-year? Do you think the fourth quarter steps down? I know you're reiterating the full year is kind of in line with last year, but if it's off by a 10th of basis points or so it can move the needle a little bit. So curious specifically how you're thinking about the fourth quarter on the provision?
Michael Brown: Yes this is Michael. I'll take the first question and then hand that over to Mike for the second question. On the new owner mix, no, I don't think we'll be at 40% for the year. I think we'll be somewhere in the upper 38%, right around 39%. Just by context in 2016, that five-year average was at 33%. We've made significant changes to move our new owner mix up and are very pleased with where we're going to end this year. The reality is on a very positive front, our owner arrivals were up, and therefore, natural increased sales on the owner side dilutes the new owner mix as a percent of sales and we also wanted to call out in second quarter, being behind on those new owner tours has also diluted that. So we wanted to reset those expectations very comfortable with the change and as we called out in the last 24 months, we're expecting about a 300 basis points increase in new owners sales mix which really is right on the trajectory to get us where we ultimately want to be in the mid-40s for new owner sales mix. Mike?
Mike Hug: Yes. And on the provision trend you are right third quarter of this year will be comparable to the third quarter of last year. And we will see a more significant decline in the fourth quarter, consistent with what we saw in 2018, confidence in those numbers is really what allows us to reaffirm the 20.5% for the full year.
Jared Shojaian: Got it. So the fourth quarter steps down obviously from the third quarter, but are you saying fourth quarter down more year-over-year than like what you're seeing in the third quarter? 
Mike Hug: Yes.
Jared Shojaian: Okay, great. Thank you so much.
Mike Hug: Sure.
Michael Brown: Thank you, Jared. 
Operator: We'll go next to Brian Dobson with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead. 
Brian Dobson : Hey, good morning. So you mentioned that Blue Thread tours were up roughly 33% in the quarter. How do you see that, or rather how do you project that trajectory through the balance of the year? And what percentage of tours do you think that Blue Thread will generate next year?
Michael Brown: So, as you look at Blue Thread for the remainder of the year, we talked about tours and we talked about a really strong second quarter. The way the Blue Thread mix works is we have a combination of in-hotel marketing, we have called transfer and then we have rentals through the Wyndham website that ultimately come to our resorts and convert the tours. The hotel portion in the rental is very straightforward to project and we feel confident that what we've laid out for our full year projections, we have good line of sight on that. The encouraging number in Q2 which we had not included in our prepared remarks was that our call volume in the second quarter of Blue Thread was up 70%. And when call volume is up that much, that's a precursor for future packages and therefore future arrivals for tour. Those typically come six to 18 months after the call. So the fact that we saw such an increase in call volume in the second quarter around the Blue Thread really is encouraging for us as we move forward for the remainder of this year. At this stage, although I do anticipate Blue Thread increasing as a percent of our new owner mix, we’re going to wait till later this year to fine-tune and actually put a precise range for that number.
Brian Dobson : Alright, understandable. And then you referenced radio advertising a little bit earlier in the call. Could you talk about the other marketing channels you're using in terms of consumer outreach and improving consumer perception of the product?
Michael Brown: Absolutely, I would start on the Internet, the changes that we’ve implemented and the efforts we've put forward, we have a world-class digital team that's really laying out for us the perception of Wyndham Destinations, Wyndham Vacation Clubs and now with the launch of the two new brands, a greater presence. It's all around the enjoyment and the value of owning timeshare. And that's where the vast majority of our energy and money is going to within our existing budgets today. The radio is simply one more avenue. I would not anticipate it being, the majority of it is just one more avenue that we want people to hear positive messaging about their ownership. We see it in the actual results one by one, and in our owner base. But you don't really hear that positive messaging until now. And we just wanted to be out there in one more medium to present that positive message.
Brian Dobson : Thank you.
Michael Brown: And Brian, one other thing which is not directly answering your question but it does, the other thing that, I think, is very important where we're putting money is what I mentioned in the second quarter or first quarter, which is around our CRM system. We are putting a significant amount of investment in our CRM system where we're partnering with Salesforce. We communicated in the first quarter that we would be fully rolled out by the end of this year to all of our sales locations in North America. And we are on track a quarter later for that to be done. And that will be not only efficiency on the back of house, but really approve the customer experience from marketing and sales standpoint.
Brian Dobson : Excellent thanks so much.
Michael Brown: Thank you Brian.
Operator: Next we have a follow-up from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Stephen Grambling: Hey, thanks for sneaking me back on. Since as you mentioned, acquisition opportunity should get better and better as a cycle drags on or even deteriorates. One question we continue to get is just the resilience of the free cash flow stream across cycles. Can you just remind us what drove some of the big swings in free cash flow last cycle in the business and how the model has changed now that could and should smooth that out? Thanks.
Mike Hug: Yes, thanks for the question Steve. This is Mike Hug. Really the big drivers of the free cash flow swings prior to 2008 and 2009 were two things, one the way we procured inventory. As you guys know, we did self development of inventory, which means in some years we were putting a lot of money into development, especially if you were doing a large 200-unit or 300-unit a tower. We've obviously switched that model to a just in time model where we're working with partners, we take the inventory down as we needed to support sales plan, which allows for very consistent spending on inventory of about $250 million per year. The other big driver was, we did quite a bit of marketing pre-2008 to sub-600 FICCOs they were very reliant on financing when it came to the purchase. And the attractiveness of that to the ABS markets wasn't always at the level we would have liked it to be, which is why we eliminated the sub-600 FICCOs beginning in January of 2009 that resulted in higher down payments. So more cash at that the sales table, as well as consistent ABS transactions as we've demonstrated really since 2010 and especially since our spin over the last 12 months where we've been able to go down to the BB Tranches and increase that advance rate to 98%. So consistent inventory spending to the just-in-time model, and then making sure we maintain quality in terms of who we market to and the underwriting standards that we have in place.
Stephen Grambling: Fair enough. Thanks so much 
Operator: And this will conclude our question-and-answer period. I'd like their turn on the call back to Michael Brown for closing remarks. 
Michael Brown: Thank you. And let me close by reiterating how pleased we are with our team's execution in the second quarter. Our progress thus far would not be possible without the dedication and enthusiasm of our nearly 25,000 associates who are committed to our mission to provide our owners, members and guests with great vacations. I personally like to thank them for all their hard work during our first year as a public company. We are excited for the rest of the year as we continue to put the world on vacation. Thank you for joining us and we look forward to updating you next time.
Operator: And this will conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-05-03 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to today’s Tyler Technologies First Quarter 2019 Conference Call. Your host for today’s call is John Marr, Chairman of Tyler Technologies. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, May 2, 2019. And now I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Marr. Please go ahead, sir.
John Marr: Thank you, Keith, and welcome to our first quarter 2019 earnings call. With me on the call today are Lynn Moore, our President and Chief Financial Officer – Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I’d like for Brian to give the safe harbor statement. Next, Lynn will have some preliminary comments. Then Brian will review the details of our first quarter results and update our 2019 guidance, then I’ll have some final comments and we’ll take your questions. Brian?
Brian Miller: Thank you, John. During the course of this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information and may include projections concerning the company’s future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Effective January 1, 2019, we adopted the requirements of ASU No. 2016-02 (Topic 842), Leases, utilizing the modified retrospective method of transition. Our balance sheet now includes both operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities. Previous consolidated financial statements were not restated under the modified retrospective method. Please note that our growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Lynn?
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. Our first quarter results provided a solid start to 2019. This was our 30th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth, as total GAAP revenues grew 11.7% and non-GAAP revenues grew 12.4%. Our core software revenues from licenses and subscriptions grew 25% on a non-GAAP basis, with approximately 13% organic growth. Software license and royalties revenues in the first quarter declined 4.3% as the mix of new business was more heavily weighted towards subscription arrangements. Approximately 54% of the value of new software deals came from subscription arrangements and 46% from on-premise licenses arrangements. GAAP subscription revenues grew 37.2% and non-GAAP subscription revenues grew 38.5%. Total recurring revenues from maintenance and subscriptions grew 17.1% and comprised 68% of total revenue. As mentioned earlier, our mix of new business was more heavily weighted toward subscriptions, which put pressure on short-term organic growth, but is a long-term positive for Tyler. Our largest deal of the quarter was a contract with the Bahamas for appraisal services, valued at over $7 million. For our iasWorld property tax software solution, we signed a SaaS arrangement with Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania, valued at approximately $4 million, as well as a license agreement with Berks County, Pennsylvania and a SaaS deal with Chesterfield County, Virginia, each valued at approximately $3 million. It was also a very robust new business quarter for our ERP solutions. The largest deals of the quarter were SaaS arrangements for Munis, with Guilford County, North Carolina, valued at approximately $5 million; New Castle County, Delaware, valued at approximately $4 million; and the Richton independent School District in Texas, valued at approximately $3 million. We also signed SaaS contracts for Munis valued at over $1 million each, with Las Virgenes Water District in California, Otsego County, New York and Albany, Georgia. Notable license deals for Munis signed during the quarter included contracts with the Micronesian island nation of the Republic of Palau, the Hall County Schools in Georgia and Flagler County, Florida. We also had a very strong quarter for new contracts with our New World Public Safety solutions. Contracts included notable on-premises license deals, with Monroe County, New York and Paulding County, Georgia. And a subscription agreement with Mount Vernon, New York. For our Odyssey Courts & Justice solution, we signed on-premises license contracts with the Cleveland, Ohio Municipal Court and the state of Maine District Attorney’s Office, as well as SaaS arrangements with Liberty County, Texas and the city of Shreveport, Louisiana, which also included our recent acquisition, CaseloadPRO. In addition, we signed an amendment with the state of Illinois to add criminal e-filing, valued at approximately $2 million. For our Socrata Data Insight solution, significant new signings included: The Nature Conservancy, the U.S. Department of Justice, the City of Everett, Washington, and Baltimore County, Maryland. Finally, for our recently acquired MicroPact solution, we signed a notable federal deal for entellitrak with the Merit Systems Protection Board. As mentioned on our previous earnings call, on February 1, we acquired MyCivic, and on February 28, we closed the acquisition of MicroPact. We’re excited about the addition of the solutions as well as the team members from both of these companies, and believe that both acquisitions will benefit Tyler by providing avenues into new markets and across our current client base. Now I’d like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and update our annual guidance for 2019.
Brian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2019. I’m going to provide some additional data on the quarter’s performance and update our annual guidance for 2019, and then John will have some additional comments. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. These measures exclude write-downs of acquisition-related deferred revenue and acquired leases, share-based compensation expense, the employer portion of payroll taxes on employee stock transactions, amortization of acquired intangibles and acquisition-related expenses. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We have also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financial Reports tab, schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. GAAP revenues for the quarter were $247.1 million, up 11.7%. On a non-GAAP basis, revenues were $248.8 million, up 12.4%. Organic revenue growth was 5.5% on a GAAP basis and 5.4% on a non-GAAP basis. As Lynn mentioned earlier, the mix of new software business was weighted towards subscription arrangements, which dampened our organic growth rate for the first quarter. Our core software license and subscription revenues combined grew organically approximately 13%. Subscription revenues for the quarter increased 37.2%. We added 128 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 13 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $49 million in total contract value. In Q1 of last year, we added 122 new subscription-based arrangements and had 26 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $25 million in total contract value. Subscription contract value comprised 54% of the total new software contract value signed this quarter, compared to 40% in Q1 last year. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 4.1 years, compared to 4.7 years in Q1 of last year. Transaction-based revenues from e-filing and online payments, which are included in subscriptions, increased 15.6% to $19.2 million, from $16.6 million last year. That amount includes e-filing revenue of $14.6 million, up 17.3% over last year. Annualized total non-GAAP recurring revenues for Q1 were approximately $676 million, up 18.1%. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $1.3 billion, up 4.9%. Backlog included $353 million of maintenance compared to $335 million a year ago. Subscription backlog was $489 million, compared to $468 million last year, and includes approximately $110 million related to fixed fee e-filing contracts. Our bookings for the quarter, which are calculated from the change in backlog plus non-GAAP revenues, were approximately $228 million, an increase of 17% from Q1 of last year. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $994 million, down 4.1%. As we noted earlier, the weighted average term of new software subscription agreements this quarter was 4.1 years compared to 4.7 years last year as we continue to move to standardize on shorter initial subscription terms for most of our software offerings, to provide greater pricing flexibility. If the term of subscription agreements had been the same as in Q1 of last year, bookings growth this quarter would have been 2.6 points higher. Our subscription – software subscription bookings in the quarter added $11.4 million in new annual recurring revenue, up 148% over the last year’s $4.6 million. For comparison, if all of our new subscription contracts this quarter had been under license arrangements, we estimate that they would have represented additional license bookings of approximately $12 million. We signed 35 new contracts in the quarter that included software licenses greater than $100,000, and those contracts had an average license of $376,000, compared to 33 new contracts with an average license value of $387,000 in the first quarter of 2018. We ended the quarter with $120 million in cash and investments, and $85 million of debt under our revolving credit facility. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 72,000 shares of our stock for a total of $14.3 million. Day sales outstanding and accounts receivable was 104 days at March 31, 2019, compared to 88 days at March 31, 2018. The increase in DSOs is primarily related to the timing of milestone billings under several large percentage of completion contracts, resulting in a $25 million year-over-year increase in unbilled receivables. Excluding unbilled receivables, DSOs were 73 days at March 31, 2019, compared to 61 days at March 31, 2018. Our guidance for the full year of 2019 is as follows: we expect 2019 GAAP revenues will be between $1.08 billion and $1.10 billion, and non-GAAP revenues will be between $1.09 billion and $1.11 billion. We expect 2019 GAAP diluted EPS will be between three point – $3.45 and $3.60, and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock option exercises on the GAAP effective tax rate as well as the final valuation of acquired intangibles. We expect 2019 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $5.20 and $5.35. For the year, estimated pretax non-cash share-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $62 million. We expect R&D expense for the year will be between $82 million and $84 million, fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between 40 million and 41 million shares. GAAP earnings per share assumes an estimated annual effective tax rate of 10% after discrete tax items, and includes approximately $27 million of estimated discrete tax benefits related to share-based compensation, which may vary significantly based on the timing and volume of stock option exercises. Our estimated non-GAAP annual effective tax rate for 2019 is 24%. We expect our total capital expenditures will be between $48 million and $50 million for the year, including approximately $22 million related to real estate and approximately $6 million of capitalized software at MicroPact. Total depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $77 million, including approximately $51 million of amortize – amortization of acquired intangibles. Now I’d like to turn the call back over to John for his comments.
John Marr: Thanks, Brian. We’re pleased with our first quarter results and our outlook for the rest of the year. We began to achieve double-digit revenue growth, even if subscriptions made up more than 50% of new software contracts. We have now achieved subscription revenue growth of greater than 20% in 48 of our last 53 quarters. Bookings growth was strong and our new business pipeline remains active. We’re also pleased to have completed two strategic acquisitions during the quarter. MyCivic will elevate Tyler’s current citizen-facing applications by enabling clients to provide a single app for citizens to interact with their local governments in multiple ways. MicroPact is the second largest acquisition in the company’s history, and augments our product solutions, positions us in new practices such as health and human services, and presents opportunities to expand our business across new and complementary markets, including the federal market. Finally, we want to thank the nearly 6,000 clients and 1,000 Tyler associates and partners who participated in Connect 2019, our annual user conference held in Dallas last month. This was our largest Connect ever by a wide margin. We welcomed clients from all 50 states, Guam, Canada, Spain and the Netherlands, who took part in 1,100 training classes across 66 different educational tracks, featuring 18 different Tyler product groups, as we continue to share progress with our vision on Connected Communities. We were especially honored to welcome former President George W. Bush as the featured speaker at Connect, and we were all inspired by President Bush and his appreciation of the challenges faced by those working in the public sector. We also hosted investor and analysts at Connect, and the presentations and replay of our Investor Day are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. Now, Keith, we’ll take questions.
Operator: Yes, thank you. We’ll now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] And this morning’s first question comes from Brent Bracelin with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Brent Bracelin: Thanks for taking my question. Lynn, perhaps I’ll start with you, and this more of a, kind of strategy question, particularly on the heels of coming off this user conference. But as we think about kind of software model transitions, lots of – we’ve seen lots of software companies transition to kind of a subscription-first approach, while still giving some customers flexibility in the licensing side. You’re starting to see in large customers go to this – in choosing kind of subscription. At what point do you start to incentivize the sales team to lead with subscription? And just wanted to understand kind of the philosophy behind a subscription-first approach going forward, just given the changing customer preferences that we’re seeing show up here in the quarter?
Lynn Moore: Yes, sure, Brent. No question, we’re continuing to see an evolution in the market. I think if you look, sort of through – at the subscription rates 5 years ago versus today, it’s significantly different. I’d anticipate that five years from now, it will continue to be different. Historically, as you know, we’ve taken the approach of a little bit of agnostic. There’s still a good chunk of the market out there that is looking for on-premises, but at the same time, we are making plans internally as the markets continue to shift to the cloud. We had not gotten to the point where we’re actually trying to lead the market in that direction. We are being responsive. But we do have a number of cloud initiatives going on within Tyler from a product standpoint. In other words, in other areas, and it is a focus for us as we look out over the next couple of years.
Brent Bracelin: Got it. Certainly helpful color there. And then just as a technology kind of focus, would you want – is there a kind of governor related to moving to subscription first around technology, i.e, would you want a multitenant kind of SaaS offering before you kind of push it? Or is that less tied to the decision tree around moving towards a subscription-first approach?
Lynn Moore: Well, as you know, each of our product lines are – our leading products have 25, 30 years of functional – deep functionality that’s been put in them. We’re taking the approach that we’re evolving those products. As we look to move to the cloud, and as we look to even potentially move to the public cloud more as opposed to the Tyler cloud, we are doing product assessments right now. There’s different ways of sort of addressing the multi-tenancy. In some areas, it’s more practical than others. In some areas, you may have more of a multitenant front end, but they have a single instance back end, and there’s certain areas where you would get multitenant all the way through. We’re actually doing some sort of long-term product analysis in that regard right now. I wouldn’t expect anything in the near term to come out with that, but that is part of our long-range planning from a strategic basis.
Brent Bracelin: Got it, super helpful color there, appreciate the transparency. And then, last one for me, just Brian, as you think about that e-filing business, a snap back in growth there. I know it dipped below double digits, now we’re back healthy in double-digit growth territory there. Can you just remind us the visibility you have into that business, the timing of the rebound here, and if that’s sustainable? Thanks.
Brian Miller: Sure. Visibility varies there. We have a fair number of commitments for new e-filing customers already signed up. And some of these are customers where were in the process of implementing a court system and they’ll start e-filing once that court system goes live. Those are currently engaged in e-filing, but on an optional basis, and at some point, depending on their own internal schedules, we’ll move to mandatory e-filing. So we have some visibility over that, but the visibility over the timing isn’t perfect. We also certainly have a pipeline of new customers that we’re pursuing on the e-filing basis, some of which are existing Tyler courts customers, and some of which are not. So I’d say visibility over new business is fairly good, but the timing can certainly vary. I’d expect to see growth kind of in this mid-teens range throughout this year and beyond that. We do believe that both e-filing as well as some of the other e-services, like research and Modria Online Dispute Resolution will continue to be drivers that grow above Tyler’s core organic growth rate.
Brent Bracelin: Got it, helpful color there, I’ll see it for, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Peter Heckmann with D.A. Davidson.
Peter Heckmann: Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. Could you – Brian, could you remind us, in terms of your annual guidance, what is your assumption for mix to subscription? And how might those organic growth calculations change the mix for the rest of the year, look like the mix in the first quarter?
Brian Miller: Yes. The range of our guidance, which is still relatively wide on the revenue side, encompasses what we believe is the reasonable range that, that mix might fall in. And I’d say, this quarter would be on the high end of that in terms of the subscription mix at 54%. So I think it ranges broadly between kind of 45% and 55% subscription mix if it stayed at north of, say 55% for the full year, that would be challenging to achieve in revenue. But we do have visibility into a lot of the mix in the pipeline, which, and based on that, we believe that the actual mix for the full year will fall within the range that our guidance encompasses.
Peter Heckmann: Got it, that’s helpful. And then, now that you’ve had MicroPact for a couple months, any updated thoughts? As we speak, have you been able to initiate any early cross selling discussion? Look, has there been any notable bookings since close and can you talk about what you think the top line growth rate might look like as MicroPact falls into organic calculation next year?
Lynn Moore: Yes, Pete, let me take some of that, and then Brian may get to the growth rate question. MicroPact, we have owned – we’ve only owned it – it was only 1 month in this year’s financials. We have owned it a couple of months. There’s a lot of excitement, both from their team and our team about it. The initial transition’s going well. We’re encouraged by the amount of federal activity that they experienced in Q1. It was coming off a couple years of a little bit muted activity. I think we described that on our last call with the changing administration. But even with the strong – I mean, even with the government shutdown in Q1, they had a good strong license quarter. We had a couple of nice wins in the first quarter. I mentioned one in my opening comments, the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board, which is really a federal administrative law judges' agency that conducts employee appeals and merit system studies. What’s interesting about that is there are multiple ALJ, administrated law judge, agencies both at the federal and state levels, so getting one of those is strategic. We had a nice win with the Tennessee Office of the Inspector General, which is something that looks at civil and criminal fraud abuse in the Tenn care programs – Tennessee care programs. Again, strategic because it was our first state-level Inspector General deal, and again, there’s a lot of Inspector General Offices throughout in both the federal government as well as in the state and local agencies. So some encouraging signs, but again, we’ve had it now two months, but we’re happy with the team, we’re happy we’ve done the acquisition. I think you – had also mentioned some cross-selling. Here, right now, I’d say, we’ve introduced the Socrata platform there. We’re very early in the stages of doing that analysis, but we believe Socrata will play well in their federal agencies. And so with that, Brian, do you want to...
Brian Miller: Yes. In terms of their growth rate, I’d say this year we’d be – have expectations around growth, sort of in line with Tyler’s overall growth, kind of that high single digits. Certainly, some opportunities to outperform that, but at this point, I think we’re comfortable with growth at MicroPact, in line with Tyler’s overall growth.
Peter Heckmann: Great, that’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.
Kirk Materne: Thanks very much. I guess, just maybe, the first one’s for Brian. Brian, just in terms of the subscription mix this quarter, and you mentioned going forward in the year, you feel pretty comfortable right how about, sort of the composition that the pipeline sets up. But when you continue this quarter, were a lot of those a deals that ended up going subscription, are these decisions that customers are making at the last minute, so it’s just getting harder for you guys to get visibility into that? And then I just had a quick follow-up on that front.
Brian Miller: It’s a mix, and it varies from quarter-to-quarter. Certainly there are deals in the pipeline that only 1 on-premises from the start, there are deals that – typically, a smaller group of deals that only want subscription, although that number is, over time, increasing. And some don’t know that we give proposals for both a subscription arrangement and a license arrangement, and some of those select Tyler, and even up until very close to when they execute a contract, they haven’t decided yet. So we certainly, going into the last month of the quarter, we have deals that we’ve been awarded that don’t know which way they’re going to go in terms of subscription or license. So there’s a variety, and it’s different each quarter. And so it does make it a little less predictable than just knowing if we’re going to win the deal or not. And over time, we probably get a little better at that, but it does create some uncertainty, and that’s one reason we keep the guidance range on the revenue side a bit wide, maybe a bit farther into the year.
Kirk Materne: And just – if a customer does go subscription, can you just remind, I guess me, of the reg rec around that? Do you start to get to recognize that once it’s invoiced? Or do you have to wait until they’ve actually implemented the technology? Meaning, I think all of us understand that the benefit – the long-term benefit of bookings versus maybe upfront, but I guess, just when do the bookings start to come in on to the income statement for you?
Brian Miller: Yes. When we sign a subscription arrangement, generally, we start recognizing revenue when they have access to the software, which is pretty close to the signing. So we’ll generally start to recognize those and those are recognized on a pro rata basis over the term of the agreement, and most of those agreements have a fixed fee over that initial term of the agreement. But we do start recognizing pretty quickly.
Kirk Materne: Okay, good. So some of those deployed this quarter will start showing up this fiscal year, not – you don’t have to wait 12 months or whatever?
Brian Miller: Yes. To the extent that mix is higher on subscription, it’s better for us because that’s early the year, when we get more benefit in the current year.
Kirk Materne: And last one, and maybe for Lynn, just said clearly, the subscription mix keeps going up, it seems that your customer base is slowly getting more comfortable with your cloud-based technology. What’s the opportunity for you all to sort of partner up with one of the bigger public cloud vendors, to allow them to focus more on the infrastructure and you all simply, you can either focus more on the application side? Is it still too early on that front? It seems like an opportunity maybe longer term? Just any thoughts you might have on that would be helpful.
Lynn Moore: I think that’s – I think you’ve stated a good point. It’s certainly an opportunity. As I mentioned earlier, we’re looking at the move to the cloud from a sort of a company-wide, long-term strategic perspective. And doing something like that is certainly something that’s on the list of – that we’re looking into.
Kirk Materne: Great, I leave you there. I’ll turn to others. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray.
Alex Zukin: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just maybe a couple. Maybe staying around the same topic. Lynn, can you remind us, just of the unit economics, when a customer goes with the subscription arrangement versus a license arrangement? Clearly, you’re getting more pricing flexibility because of the contract duration being smaller, but why not have – why not charge more for subscription? And why not incentivize the sales organization around selling subscription in a more meaningful way to kind of drive cloud transition, given the customers are a bit more open to that historically adapting it?
Lynn Moore: Sure. As we said, it does seem – the market is moving. It does still vary from quarter to quarter. We had a pretty strong SaaS quarter this quarter, but I think overall, if you step back it is moving. Again, historically, we have not done that. In part because, at the end of the day, the value of Tyler is capturing the customer for long-term value, whether it’s on-prem or subscription. And so we want to make sure we get that customer and there’s still a fair amount of business out there, that if we went 100% one way, we would start missing out on. We think that we can evolve over time and help lead that a little bit, but again, we’re about trying to capture the customer. You asked about the model. Generally speaking, it’s about three years before, when you take the original license in the maintenance versus the subscription, to where it sort of – I think those lines intersect. Then when you start looking at long-term, you know, 10 years, we believe, it’s in sort of the 1.8% times revenue.
Alex Zukin: Got it. And then maybe for Brian, how should we think about the Public Safety business this year, when we start to kind of core Tyler growth and how do the pipelines look at the moment? It seems like you’re closing the deals that flipped out of Q4? What’s the curve look like? Do you feel like there’s going to be more linearity now that you’ve had it under, under your belt for longer, you understand that business a little bit better, just help us frame that a bit?
Lynn Moore: Well that business is still heavily weighted towards the second half of the year, and particularly in the fourth quarter. And we expect that to be the case this year. Having said that, this was a really strong first quarter. I think their bookings were up, in Q1, 38% over last year’s Q1, and this may have been the best first quarter for bookings they’ve ever had. Now as you know, that part of that is due to some deals that we had originally expected would have been back in Q4, that – and I think all of those deals that we had expected to close in Q1 did close this quarter. But we still expect it’ll be a heavily fourth quarter weighted business this year, but see times of really good growth, the investments we’ve made in the product over the last three years since we acquired New World are really starting to manifest themselves in these higher win rates and bigger opportunities and starting to affect deals in the market. We do think that, also this year, that we’re now positioned to start to pursue some deals that are larger than those that New World’s typically focused on in the past, with the investments we’ve made over the last couple of years, now at the point where we can respond to our fees for bigger deals. That we wouldn’t expect to have an impact on this year. Those are long sales processes, and to the extent we start to pursue some of those larger deals this year, there are probably decisions that are made well into next year beyond and see revenues beyond that. But we feel like the foundation we’ve laid there for growth that starts to catch up with Tyler’s overall growth and starts to contribute to higher growth in Tyler’s core, in the Public Safety area, are starting to pay off.
Alex Zukin: Got it. And then just one final one on cash flow. Is there any – anything unusual on collections in the quarter? I think cash flow, I remember, was a little bit light of our expectations. And maybe, can you just give an update on where should be thinking about for free cash flow for the year?
Lynn Moore: Sure. We don’t guide to free cash flow, but – that we’ve talked about cash flow growth, in excess of our non-GAAP earnings growth. And I think we probably expect to see that this year. We – this quarter, cash flow, really, I think the biggest factor there, in terms of that being below last year’s is increase in unbilleds, and that’s coming from a couple of places: one, we have a number of relatively large percentage of completion contracts, some on the tax side, think places like New York City, where we have a very large project underway, New York state, where we also have a large tax project underway; British Columbia, and those all have milestone billing arrangements. And those milestones lag where we recognize revenue. New York City is one of those where we went live this quarter, with their new property tax system, and so we expect to see a significant billing here in Q2 following that milestone. But we have a number of those large projects that have unbilleds, so it’s just the timing of those billing arrangements that – until they turn around. We do expect to see some of those this year. The other impact is from the adoption of 606, where we recognize revenue at a faster rate on licenses. We used to recognize revenue just to the extent we could bill it, so we didn’t have unbilled receivables on licenses. Now under 606, we recognize that upfront and it creates an unbilled receivable, so it drives DSOs up. But I think we’d expect to see free cash flow growth in probably low double digits over last year.
Alex Zukin: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Rob Oliver with Baird.
Rob Oliver: Hi, guys. thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow-up on the Public Safety commentary. If we could get a little bit more color on some of the deals, some of the wins that you had this quarter, I know there was some carryover wins from – or some deals that were pushed out from last quarter. But in particular, relative to the competitive landscape, does Tyler incumbency on the ERP side play a role here? How much is cross-selling, playing into the strength? And then Brian, I know you mentioned that you guys are now set up for some larger deals, exiting this year, and I wanted to just drill down on that a little bit. And then I had 1 follow up.
Lynn Moore: I’ll start with that, Rob. In terms of the competitive – the deals of Q1, yes, we are becoming more competitive. The investments are starting to pay off. You talked about cross-selling, I think we talked about on the last earnings call, you see more of that through our Tyler line story and where we’ve got a strong C&J presence. We talked last quarter about our C&J presence here, our Odyssey presence in the state of Texas, has opened up the state of Texas somewhat to Public Safety, and we started to win some business in a state where really they have been shut out historically. If you look in the first quarter, talking again about how our investments are starting to pay off. Public Safety got its first win in California in a little over three years, and the California pipeline looks strong. Again, that’s a result of the investments we’ve made in the product. Our RFP response rate, which is our rate in which we’re actually responding to RFPs has increased substantially year-over-year, primarily because of the investments, and we’re now able to check off the functionality, whereas before, if we had a low ability to respond, you may not go through that process. So we’re responding to more FPs, as Brian mentioned, larger RFPs. So overall, I think we’re pleased with the investments. I think some of the investments we’ve made and some acquisitions like SceneDoc and Socrata, they’re expanding their portfolio. We’re seeing leverage there, both within the Public Safety base as well as helping us competitively in new deals.
Rob Oliver: Great. Thanks. And when you guys also called out on the quarter – by the way, great quarter for the tropical island sales team of Tyler with the wins that – in Bahamas and Palau. But you also, you will – and we noticed as well, there was a pretty good international attendance at Connect. And so just wanted to just get an update on, are you signaling something to us there or just calling them out and is international kind of a burgeoning area there? Thanks.
Lynn Moore: I think a little bit was a shout out to them. It was – in particular, we talked about the Netherlands, I think those were some of our new MicroPact customers. MicroPact does have some international business. We’ve got a little bit of an international business. It’s part of our long range growth roadmap. I wouldn’t say there’s any more emphasis now than there’s been in the last couple of quarters. We have a lot of – I think we have a lot of green space here, but it’s certainly part of our long-term growth plans.
Rob Oliver: Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Scott Berg with Needham.
Scott Berg: Hi, John, Lynn and Brian. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on a good quarter. I guess, the two questions I have is, first one, on the construction side in the quarter, are any products in particular seeing a heavier set of demand, moving towards to subscription than maybe what we’ve seen in the past?
Lynn Moore: Scott, I don’t have the specific numbers by product line. It was a pretty heavy quarter on our ERP side. We’re starting to see actually a little more subscriptions in our C&J, we’ve – both in some awards and some deals. I think I mentioned in my comments there was one or two fairly significant A&T that went subscription. So it’s been a little bit across the board. The volume of contracts on ERP that seems to sway these numbers a lot and it was certainly a high quarter of the ERP side.
Scott Berg: Got it, that’s helpful – sorry, go ahead?
Brian Miller: I said, Courts & Justice, I think you’re seeing with Odyssey, greater adoption there as well. But really this quarter, the ERP side and the Appraisal & Tax side had the highest mixes of subscription relative to the other product groups. And of course, some of those dig an insight, so Socrata business is 100% subscription, so that, as that business grows, that helps push that mix more towards subscription as well.
Scott Berg: Helpful. And then me, you mentioned Socrata, you’ve had that asset now for a year now, I believe you. I guess, looking back over the last year, thoughts on progress you’re making with the products in the pipeline? I guess, are you more excited in terms of the opportunities that are out there? I know the use cases are more than abundant, but how’s the reception maybe gone today versus your expectations a year ago?
Lynn Moore: I’d say it’s meeting our expectations, Scott. I mean, when we did that acquisition, it was really part of our long-term strategic roadmap, both from a Connected Communities vision as well as opening up new markets. The prospects for governments going to be, becoming more data-driven, I think, that’s a trend we’re going to see, and it’s good that were on the forefront of it. It’s performing about where we’d like. We do have a lot of initiatives going inside Tyler, as you mentioned, across a lot of different products. We’ve done some things, as you know, when we acquired Socrata, they were already sort of in the transition from sort of the open data, open gov, to the when we now have the platform, the SCGC, say we’re focusing little bit more – pre-Tyler, they were focused more on Gov 500, that’s something that I think is still important. But we’re really now focusing on leveraging those solutions and creating solutions rather than hit the platform that will push down through our channels across our base. So yes, I’d say we’re still pleased, we’re still optimistic what it’s going to do for us in the future, and again, it’s part of our overall long-term roadmap for Connected Communities. And again, the whole concept of data-driven decisions in governments.
Scott Berg: Great, that’s I have. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Charlie Strauzer with CJS Securities.
Charlie Strauzer: Hi, good morning. Most of my question has have been answered, just a couple quick ones. Just to continue to the SaaS discussion. But as SaaS continues to show very robust growth here, and if that continues throughout the year, I would suspect that you will have an impact on hardware sales, is that correct?
Lynn Moore: Sorry, hardware sales?
Charlie Strauzer: Yes. Meaning, more SaaS means probably less hardware sales, is that correct?
Lynn Moore: Really, we don’t do – I guess, maybe marginally, but we don’t do a lot of hardware sales on, around the core products. Most of the hardware sales come from either really small clients who want to buy everything from one place. But most of it is around products like our Brazos mobile citation device product, which carries hardware with it. Our newer probation software acquisition has some hardware that goes with that. So I guess, marginally, it could reduce the hardware, but most of our hardware today is around us, Public Safety and Probation products.
Charlie Strauzer: Excellent. And then just as we look at the progression of the year, in terms of seasonality, the back half of the year versus your front half of the year versus for revenue and also in thinking about Q2, how should we think about the progression there?
Brian Miller: Yes, I think, much more heavy towards the back half of the year. We expect to see a progression – a pretty significant progression in Q2 because of getting a full quarter of MicroPact. And then expect, again growth from the last two quarters, fairly significantly above where we are in Q2. So I’d expect to see increasing growth both from an organic perspective and total growth perspective sequentially each quarter in the year. Also, organic growth will benefit from the acquisitions in 2018, particularly, Socrata and Sage becoming part of organic growth after this quarter. So again, sequential growth, but pretty strong growth from Q1 to Q2 in terms of overall revenues, and then solid growth from there to Q3 and Q4.
Charlie Strauzer: And anything funky in terms of weird comps or bookings from Q2 that we should be aware of from last year?
Lynn Moore: I think Q2 was pretty standard. I don’t recall anything jumping out as being an unusually large contract last year in Q2. Our biggest deal last year where we didn’t have any of the mega-deals throughout the year. Last year was certainly a year where we didn’t have any of the megadeals throughout the year, but I’ll take a look, but I don’t recall anything unusual in the Q2 bookings last year.
Charlie Strauzer: Great, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes Keith Housum with Northcoast Research.
Keith Housum: Good morning. Just two quick questions for you. Can you help me out, the safety wins, the wind rate this quarter versus say, what was the first quarter last year?
Lynn Moore: I’m sorry, can you repeat that, Keith? I didn’t quite catch all that.
Keith Housum: Just going back to the Public Safety segment, just looking for the win rates this year versus last year, trying to understand the progression there?
Lynn Moore: It’s pretty consistent from where it was last year. We’ve made pretty big strides, as you know, we talk about on calls the last couple of years. I’ve made the comment a few times that we didn’t have enough data points to call it a trend. I’d like to think we’re now in that trend. So it’s pretty consistent. And again, it’s consistent with a larger pipeline and a larger, more fee responses. So that’s those are all positives.
Keith Housum: Got you. And Brian, can you just remind me or provide some color on the profitability of the subscription business versus the license? What impacts to the bottom line did they you have in the quarter for movement to more subscription this quarter?
Brian Miller: Well, in the short term, it’s a negative to profitability because you’re not getting that upfront license. We have a conversion factor. And we said that if all of the subscription deals had been license deals, it would’ve been an additional, approximately $12 million of licenses, which would have generally gone directly to the bottom line and you can sort of extrapolate that, if 10% of them had been license deals. So in the short term, it puts pressure in both revenue growth and earnings growth, because those licenses would’ve gone, for the most part, directly to income. Over the long term, and as Lynn said, the breakeven point, say, for a three-year subscription agreement is somewhere around that, in the end of that third year, later in the fourth year in terms of revenues is breaking even. And after that first year, the margins are higher and the earnings are higher on the subscription arrangement over the life of the subscription agreement, certainly revenues might be double, and even with the double, what it would’ve been under a license arrangement. And even with the hosting costs factored in, the earnings on that subscription arrangement will still be fairly a good amount higher than the long-term earnings on a license customer.
Keith Housum: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Jonathan Ho with William Blair & Company.
Jonathan Ho: Hi, good morning. I just wanted to maybe start out with a few higher-level questions. If clients are more willing to look at SaaS solutions, does this potentially change the type of competitor you’ll see with maybe some of the commercial SaaS ERP vendors that haven’t competed as much in this space, maybe trying to get more of a foothold in the market?
Lynn Moore: John, we’re not seeing a lot of that right now. They certainly come into our space from time to time. The difference still is, is if the decision’s not, well, SaaS or cloud, maybe a big part of the decision is, at the end of the day, it’s the features and functionality that we’ve got that maybe the commercial base vendors don’t have, and it’s that deep domain expertise. Certainly it’s, you see a little bit more, it will be a – but I don’t see it just yet, as a trend in the market.
Jonathan Ho: Got it. And then, just in terms of the investments that you’ve made across the broader product suite, are you starting to see opportunities to become more of a strategic partner for agencies as opposed to just selling sort of point solutions on a contract-by-contract basis? Just trying to understand this, these agencies go through digital transformation whether you’ve got an opportunity to influence that a little bit more?
Lynn Moore: Well, I think that’s part of our long-term strategy and goal, that’s kind of what Connected Community is all about. We talked about it last quarter, with the city of Lubbock deal when we sold a whole host of solutions. I think that’s an opportunity down the road, and that’s something that I think we’re uniquely positioned to do. Which is part of our overall growth strategy.
Jonathan Ho: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the next question comes from Tim Klasell with Northland Securities.
Tim Klasell: Hi, guys. Just a couple of quick questions. One, on your conference calls, ServiceNow mentioned that they saw a nice uptick in federal government for various reasons. Being offered a somewhat similar platform as MicroPact, and now that you’ve had it for a couple of months, any changes in your thinking with how that will affect, obviously, the federal business and how much of that will be sold into your core state and local?
Lynn Moore: I don’t know that our, Tim, that our thoughts have changed a lot. Like I mentioned a few minutes ago, as you’ve said, we’ve had MicroPact for a couple months. We’re very excited about it. They had a very strong first quarter, relatively speaking. They had some nice, strategic wins. There are some big competitors in that space, but we’re faring well. We’ve had some nice wins, not yet contracts, over some significant name competitors, which we’re excited about. But overall, we’re excited about the opportunity.
Tim Klasell: Okay, good. And then jumping over just to the subscription side, I think Brian, you mentioned you had three buckets of the guys who are thinking, crowd guys, who are sort of maybe in the middle, and guys who were thinking going SaaS. And I understand that the guys in the middle, that is pretty variable. But in your results, is there – how much of it is due to, gee, you just had a stronger quarter or maybe a higher hit rate in the bucket of maybe on-prem versus maybe a little bit lower in the SaaS or vice versa? How much of the variability is just randomness in the deals coming in versus the middle bucket, just being hard to call?
Lynn Moore: I think a lot of it is just randomness. It just varies based on – and you’re seeing those percentages, although the trend over a long period has been towards more subscription, you’ve seen those percentages in the mix bounce around a lot from quarter-to-quarter. And frankly, just a lot of it is randomness. The customers that happen to make decisions in this quarter, which one of those buckets they fall in. I do think that today, that a lot of the customers still are in one of the camps or the other, and that often, we have somewhat limited ability to drive them more towards subscription. But generally, to the extent that we do believe we have the ability to influence someone, and it could be because they’re open to either model, or it could be that as we go through the process, that we find that maybe due to their infrastructure or challenges they have internally, that they’re a better candidate for a SaaS arrangement, and we are able to move them more towards that. But in many cases, we have a pretty limited ability to change which way they want to go. But there’s a lot of randomness in there, and I think you’ll continue to see that bounce around from quarter-to-quarter.
Tim Klasell: Okay, good. And then one final one, I think in a past case, you guys mentioned, you’re awarded, but not signed. Sort of your off-balance-sheet backlog, if you will. Has that changed appreciably this last quarter? Or was it sort of looking at your normal, sort of band, if you will?
Lynn Moore: Pretty normal. We talked about an active pipeline. We certainly got, we like to have a number of deals that are awarded. Sometimes to predict exactly how long that contracting cycle will be, particularly with larger deals that take longer, the more complex processes, to get to a signature on a contract. But I’d say the volume of those is pretty normal right now.
Tim Klasell: Great, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And this time, there appear to be no more questions. Mr. Marr, I’ll turn the call back to you for closing comments.
John Marr: Okay. Thank you, Brian. Thank you for joining us today. If you have any further questions, feel free to call Lynn, Brian, or myself. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-22 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to today's Tyler Technologies Fourth Quarter 2018 Conference Call. Your host for today's call is John Marr, Chairman of Tyler Technologies. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, February 21, 2019. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Marr. Please go ahead, sir.
John Marr : Thank you, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. With me on the call today are Lynn Moore, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like for Brian to give the safe harbor statement. Then Lynn will have some preliminary comments. Then Brian will review the details of our fourth quarter results and provide our 2019 guidance. Then I'll have some final comments, and we'll take your questions. Brian?
Brian Miller: Thanks, John. During the course of this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information that may include projections concerning the Company's future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause the actual results to differ materially from these projections. We'd refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Effective January 1st, 2018, we adopted the requirements of ASU No. 2014-09 Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, utilizing the full retrospective method of transition. Prior year amounts have been restated from previously reported amounts to reflect the impact of the full retrospective adoption of Topic 606. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless we specify otherwise. Lynn?
Lynn Moore: Thanks Brian. Our fourth quarter results provided a solid finish to 2018. This was our 29th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth as total GAAP revenues grew 11.2% and non-GAAP revenues grew 11.5%. Organic growth improved from the third quarter to 7.4% on a GAAP basis and 7.3% on a non-GAAP basis. Revenue came in at the low end of our guidance range, primarily due to a higher level of software subscription contracts and the new business mix as well as the timing of several public safety deals that slipped out of the fourth quarter. With regard to growth expectations, we focus internally more on total growth than on the distinction between the organic and inorganic components. We've discussed before our expectation that over time, our organic growth likely slows somewhat. Part of that is simply due to large numbers. With revenues that will exceed $1 billion in 2019, achieving double-digit growth organically is increasingly difficult in a market that grows in the mid-single digit range, especially when combined with the near-term revenue headwind that comes with the continuing shift toward software subscriptions in our new business mix. In addition, maintenance from on-premise clients makes up about 40% of our revenues. And although we have extremely low attrition and a history of consistent annual increases in rates, those factors generally result in 6% or 7% growth in maintenance revenues. Also, while appraisal services makes up less than 3% of our total revenues, they are cyclical in nature, and in 2018, were down 12.7%. That decline alone reduced organic revenue growth 60 basis points for the year. Against that backdrop, we think it's especially important to note that our core software revenues, those revenues from licenses and subscriptions are consistently growing organically in solid double-digits. In the fourth quarter, our core software license and subscription revenues grew 24% on a non-GAAP basis with 15% organic growth. And for the year, they grew 23% with 17% organic growth. We also expect that we will continue to supplement our organic growth with strategic acquisitions. We are patient and disciplined acquirers and look for acquisitions that strengthen our product offerings, leverage our existing client base and sales resources and expand our addressable market, all at fair valuations. We believe that, as we have proven in the past, we will supplement our organic growth with these acquisitions and continuing to achieve low double digit total growth. Software license and royalties revenues in the fourth quarter were very strong, up 15% and exceeded $25 million for the first time. GAAP subscription revenues grew 26% and non-GAAP subscription revenues grew 28%. Total recurring revenues from maintenance and subscriptions grew 13% and comprise 65% of total revenue. Our mix of new business was similar to the third quarter with approximately 60% of the value of new software deals from on-premises license arrangements and 40% from subscription arrangements. It was a particularly robust quarter for our ERP and Civic services solutions, which had strong sales throughout the year. The largest deals of the quarter were a SaaS arrangement for Munis with the city of Memphis, Tennessee, valued at approximately $4 million; and on-premises license arrangement for Munis with Jackson, Mississippi valued at over $3 million and contracts with Cape Coral, Florida for both Munis and EnerGov valued at $4.4 million. We also signed contracts valued over $2 million each with Tucson, Arizona for EnerGov and York County, Pennsylvania for Munis. For our Courts & Justice solutions, we expanded our presence with Odyssey case management in the key states of Texas and Illinois with an on-premises contract with Bell County, Texas and a SaaS contract with Macon County, Illinois each valued at more than $2.5 million. While it was an active quarter for new business in the public safety market, contract signings for several opportunities in which we were selected slipped out of the fourth quarter for a variety of reasons. Significant new on-premises contract signed in the quarter for our New World solution included Lake County, Ohio; Duluth, Minnesota; and Weslaco, Texas, along with significant SaaS agreements with Kalamazoo, Michigan and Bethlehem, New York. We continue to gain momentum with sales for our Socrata data insight solution, which we acquired on April 30th. We're particularly pleased with sales for the Socrata Connected Government Cloud or SCGC that we launched in May. Our 2018 goal was to sign six new SCGC clients by year-end and we far surpassed that was 18 SCGC sales across all levels of government in 2018. Among the fourth quarter SCGC contracts which deals with the City of Austin, Texas, Fulton County Georgia, the Idaho Supreme Court and the U.S. Department of Transportation. Finally, we signed a significant contract for our Versatrans student transportation solutions with the First Student, Inc. organization, a leading provider of school bus transportation across North America. We are particularly pleased with our cash flow for performance for the fourth quarter as well as for the full year. Free cash flow grew 39% in the fourth quarter and 46% for the full year. With our strong cash flow and balance sheet, we continue to actively pursue strategic acquisitions that support our long-term growth objectives. On October 1st, we acquired mobilize, which we discussed on the third quarter conference call. On December 7th, we acquired SceneDoc, which provides mobile first SaaS field reporting for local law  we acquired SceneDoc, which provides mobile first SaaS field reporting for local law enforcement agencies, enhancing our public safety offerings. SceneDoc enables field capture of data, electronic notes and multimedia with secure storage and access to and from the cloud from smartphones, tablets, wearables and task-specific apps which are quickly becoming first responders primary tools for communicating in the field. Subsequent to year-end, on February 1st, we acquired MyCivic a rapidly growing provider of citizen engagement applications. MyCivic will elevate our current citizen facing applications by enabling civic clients to provide a single app for citizens to interact with their local government in multiple ways. This acquisition will benefit our entire client base as MyCivic has applicability across most of our solution areas. Its unified design brings together many different user groups such as citizens, parents, public safety agencies and businesses and its mobile platform enables rapid development and deployment for clients. Most recently on February 1, we signed a definitive agreement to purchase MicroPact, Inc. The transaction will be the second largest in our history at approximately 185 million in cash and is expected to close in the first quarter. MicroPact is a leading provider of specialized, vertically oriented case management and business process management applications for government. This acquisition augments our product solutions, positions us a new practice areas such as health and human services and provides a platform to expand our business across new and complementary markets. Most notably with the opportunity to significantly expand our total addressable market through MicroPact strong federal and state presence. Now I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and provide our annual guidance for 2019.
Brian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2018. I'm going to provide some additional data on the quarter's performance and provide our annual guidance for 2019 and then John will have some additional comments. In our earnings release, we've included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. These measures that exclude writedowns of acquisition related deferred revenue and acquired leases, share-based compensation expense, the employer portion of payroll taxes on employee stock transactions and amortization of acquired intangibles. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financial Reports tab, schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. GAAP revenues for the quarter were $242 million, up 11.2%. On a non-GAAP basis, revenues were $243 million, up 11.5%. Subscription revenues for the quarter increased 26.1%. We added 81 new subscription-based arrangements and converted eight existing on-premises clients representing approximately $33.2 million in total contract value. In Q4 of last year, we added 83 new subscription-based arrangements and had 19 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $44.4 million in total contract value. The total contract value for new subscription contracts this quarter was impacted by our intentional reduction in the standard initial term for those contracts. Subscription clients represented approximately 44% of the number of new software contracts in the quarter, compared to 42% last year, while subscription contract value comprised 40% of the total new software contract value signed this quarter, compared to 33% in Q4 last year. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 4.1 years, compared to 5.4 years in Q4 of last year. Transaction-based revenues from e-filing and online payments, which are included in subscriptions, increased 6.1% to $17.3 million from $16.3 million last year. That amount includes e-filing revenue of $13.1 million, up 4.5% over last year. Annualized total non-GAAP recurring revenues for Q4 were approximately $636 million, up 13.7%. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $1.2 billion, up 1.7%. Backlog included $365 million of maintenance, compared to $348 million a year ago. Subscription backlog was $480 million, compared to $475 million last year, and includes approximately $118 million related to fixed fee e-filing contracts. Our bookings for the quarter, which are calculated from the change in backlog plus non-GAAP revenues were approximately $248 million, a decrease of 13.3% from Q4 of last year. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $960 million, down 5.8%. We had a difficult comparison to Q4 of last year, which included a $21 million contract with the State of Kansas Judicial branch. Also, as we noted earlier, the weighted average term of new software subscription agreements this quarter was 4.1 years, compared to 5.4 years last year as we continue to move to standardize on shorter initial subscription terms for most of our software offerings to provide greater pricing flexibility. The change in the term of subscription rate agreements was responsible for 2.1 points of the decline in bookings. Our software subscription bookings in the quarter added $7.9 million in new annual recurring revenue, up 11.2% from $7.1 million last year. For comparison, if all of our new subscription contracts had been under license arrangements, we estimate that they would have represented additional license bookings of approximately $8 million. We signed 46 new contracts in the quarter that included software licenses greater than $100,000 and those contracts had an average license of $371,000 compared to 48 new contracts with an average license value of $468,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017. Cash flow from operations grew 32.7% to $70.9 million. Free cash flow, which is calculated as cash from operations less CapEx was $66.9 million, up 39.2%. Our CapEx for the quarter was $4 million, compared to $5.3 million last year. We ended the quarter with $232 million in cash and investments and no outstanding debt. Day sales outstanding and accounts receivable was 111 days at December 31, 2018, compared to 102 days at December 31, 2017. Excluding current unbilled receivables DSOs were 78 days at December 31, 2018, compared to 80 days at December 31, 2017. Our guidance for the full year of 2019, which includes the estimated impact of the pending acquisition of MicroPact is as follows. We expect 2019 GAAP revenues will be between $1.08 billion and $1.10 billion and non-GAAP revenues will be between $1.09 billion and $1.1 billion. We expect 2019 GAAP diluted EPS will be between $3.54 and $3.69 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock option exercises on the GAAP effective tax rate, as well as the final valuation of acquired intangibles. We expect 2019 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $5.20 and $5.35. between $5.20 and $5.35. For the year, estimated pre-tax non-cash share based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $62 million. We expect R&D expense for the year will be between the $82 million and $84 million, fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between 40 million and 41 million shares. GAAP earnings per share assumes an estimated annual effective tax rate of 10% after discrete tax items and includes approximately $27 million of estimated discrete tax benefits primarily related to share-based compensation, which may vary significantly based on the timing and volume of stock option exercises. Our estimated non-GAAP annual effective tax rate for 2019 is 24%. We expect our total capital expenditures will be between $54 million and $56 million for the year, including approximately $16 million related to real estate and approximately $6 million of capitalized software at MicroPact. Total depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $75 million, including approximately $47 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to John for his further comments.
John Marr : Thanks, Brian. The fourth quarter continued the elevated level of investment we exhibited throughout the year. The strength of our balance sheet and consistency of our cash flow gives us a great deal of flexibility to deploy capital and create long-term value. At a high level, in 2018, we invested a total of $391 million in cash on acquisitions, R&D and stock repurchases. The purchases have mobilized in October, and SceneDoc in December, brought us to a total of five acquisitions completed in 2018 for a total cash consideration of $178 million. While these acquisitions further the objectives that Lynn mentioned earlier, expanding our TAM and strengthening our product offerings, providing cross-selling opportunities and advancing our Connected Communities vision, we're also making incremental investments in those businesses. Those investments include accelerated R&D, particularly at Socrata as well as investments in operating expenses to strengthen the acquired organization's ability to drive future growth. As a result, the 2018 acquisitions in the aggregate were dilutive to earnings in 2018 and will be dilutive in 2019. We believe those investments while putting pressure on short-term operating margins will contribute to future revenue growth and margin expansion. As we discussed at the beginning of the year, we also significantly increased our R&D spend organically. Total R&D grew 34% in 2018 to $63 million and a wide range of product development projects across our product suites. While R&D expense will grow organically at a slower rate in 2019, this year will still be a year of elevated investment in product development. With R&D and acquired companies including MicroPact, we expect total R&D to grow in the 30% range in 2019. Finally, we were very active with our stock repurchase program in the fourth quarter, as we bought back almost 781,000 shares of our stock for a total of $150 million. That amount exceeded the total amount we spent on buybacks in the last six years combined, reflecting our confidence in the long-term outlook for Tyler. Over the last 15 years, we have taken an opportunistic approach for our stock repurchases and have been particularly aggressive several times when the stock has pulled back 15% to 20% as it did in the fourth quarter. In hindsight has shown these strategies to be effective. In addition, our Board has added 1.5 million shares of that buyback authorization, which now stands at 2.7 million shares. Although our current investment cycle has put pressure on margins, we are confident that our long-term model of low double digit total revenue growth, consistent margin expansion and strong earnings and cash flow remains in place. Now we'll take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from Brent Bracelin of KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Brent Bracelin: One for Lynn and one for Brian, if I could. Lynn, I wanted to start out with a question about the business as it matures and scales to this $1 billion level. You're addressing, I think, a $14 billion TAM. My specific question is around the white space initiative. As you get to this $1 billion scale, how much room is there to continue to grow faster than the 5%, 6% growth rate of the market? How competitive is the opportunity? And as you think about five acquisitions in '18, do you think that's the right pace to continue to sustain above market growth long term given the size of the business and the scale? Thanks.
Lynn Moore: Yes, sure, Brent. Yes, I think, as we look out over the near term three, four, five years. Internally, we believe that we can continue to grow faster than the overall rate. Acquisitions have certainly played a part of that over the years and really when we look at the acquisitions we did in 2018. On some level, I call those somewhat investment acquisitions. These are things that we're buying, we're going to bring them in, we're going to invest in them and really ultimate goal is to provide and prompt higher growth rates than perhaps other parts of our business. You asked about the white space initiative. The white space initiative is where we identify things like some of the acquisitions that we brought in. It's also one of the reasons why we, in 2019, made the decision to buy MicroPact company that obviously moves us into new markets, gives us the ability to grow into new addressable markets. So, that's something that we've looked at very carefully.
Brent Bracelin: And then I guess, Brian, if I just look at the e-filing business, this quarter 6% growth down from 16% prior quarter and 22% last year. I continue to think of about e-filing as in emerging markets. So, little surprised to see the single-digit growth there. Walk us through the dynamics around e-filing, the slowdown there you saw in Q4 and then the opportunity for growth over in '19 and '20?
Brian Miller: Sure. I think two things. One, the sequential slowdown is really a seasonal impact. They are simply in the fourth quarter, particularly in December around the holidays, there's less activity in the courts, less filing taking place and to the extent that a large portion of that business is transaction-based with a per filing fee that affects that's a normal impact we see in Q4. You maybe look back at last year, and you didn't see that. It was covered up last year by some new clients that came on board, that provided growth, that offset the seasonal sequential drop. This year, we didn't really have any new clients coming on in the last quarter and we do believe that, that's a market that it still has a lot of white space, a lot of runway there, that a large portion of the e-filing market or potential finding market in the U.S. is wide open that they're not doing e-filing today. So, with our run rate, I mean, the low $50 million range in a market that we believe is close to $300 million a year, we think that less than half of that market is currently penetrated and we expect that over time will continue to add new e-filing clients. But again it's somewhat lumpy. We actually do have a reasonable pipeline of, I guess say, pipeline a bit of a backlog of e-filing arrangements that will come online once an underlying court system goes live. But, as I said, the timing of those is somewhat lumpy and we just didn't have any new ones come on this quarter.
Lynn Moore: I realize you also asked about the pace of the acquisitions in 2018. It was a year of significant activity. I wouldn't say anything specifically drove that. The white space initiative has always identified things. We constantly evaluate potential acquisitions. It's something we've done 20 years, I've been at Tyler, if you look out over the 20-year history. We've done probably 40-ish plus acquisitions. It just happen to be a year where a lot of things lined up, we saw a lot of good opportunities, we were able to make good fair deals, we've even gone through a couple of years where it was very hard to make a fair deal. We've talked before about a lot of money coming into our space from the private equity world and things like that. Bringing those acquisitions in is a stress on the organization and we've talked a little about in the last year about our elevated plus, about our elevated investments and you hear me talk about these as investment acquisitions. We've got a lot going on our plate right now and our focus right now is to really execute on all these investments that we're making.
Operator: The next question will come from Peter Heckmann of DA Davidson.
Peter Heckmann: Can we dig in a little bit more on the bookings for the full year acknowledging that there have been some large deals that occurred in prior year periods that may be exacerbating the optics of software bookings. But can you get into little bit more detail on deal slippage perhaps any change in the sales force or sales force comp that maybe affecting bookings. And then as well any change in competitive dynamics or demand drivers. So again and part of it is optics, but clearly bookings were softer in 2018. So I'm just trying to figure out what are the factors that factored into that and then what's your outlook for this year. I mean can we catch up on those deals and put up a relatively stronger bookings year in '19?
Lynn Moore: Well, certainly as you know, bookings, particularly with respect to large deals can be somewhat lumpy. And I'd say that's probably the biggest factor this year in the lower level of bookings. We had several large deals to couple more what we describe as more mega deals like a statewide courts deal, the Illinois e-filing Research deal that took place last year. Those are typically multi-year deals, so those revenues get recognized over many quarters and sometimes several years. So we continue to work out of that backlog. Even just in this quarter, if you look it was a really good quarter for our bread and butter, mid-sized deals. But if you looked at the top 10 license deals plus the top 10 SaaS deals this quarter, this totaled $35 million. Last year top 10 or top 20 deals totaled $70 million. So really it shows the impact of the large deals in there. I don't think there's anything fundamentally that's changed either in our sales organization, or sales compensation in the market dynamics, the competitive landscape generally is pretty consistent with where it's been, there's certainly been some activity in terms of acquisitions and consolidations among some of the other players in this space. But don't believe those have negatively impacted us and, in some cases, positively impacted us. The timing of deals, particularly in the Public Safety space continues to be a little less predictable and some of these are complex deals with multiple jurisdictions involved, and because a lot of that business is concentrated in the fourth quarter with public safety in general, we had a good quarter for awards, but we had a fairly large number of deals that certainly had the possibility of closing in the fourth quarter that have slipped out of the fourth quarter and several of those have closed already early in the first quarter. Variety of reasons around those, no systemic cause, but in the sense that just goes with our market. We do expect that you can see based on our guidance, based on the activity in the space that we would -- and again coming off a year with not really strong bookings that we'll see better growth in bookings next year. The last point there really is that we do have an increasing number of revenues that don't really come in terms of a single contract. So more of the recurring revenues, things like Mobi -- our online dispute resolution solution that are transaction based. And so there's not a big contract at the front but the revenues, the bookings hit as the revenues hit. And to the extent those are greater part of our revenue base, you don't see them show up in upfront bookings. And then we of course pointed out the impact of the shorter term on subscriptions that also negative, doesn't affect the annual revenues at all, but affects the optics of the booking number.
Peter Heckmann: And then just as a follow-up, you're just looking at R&D and non-cash stock compensation, last three years both have outstripped revenue growth. And I think you've talked a little bit about the R&D. Is the stock comp just a reflection of the current environment for hiring the current employment environment or are there higher skill sets, you're trying to achieve?
Lynn Moore: It's really just the way that's accounted for. So you account for the stock options on a Black-Scholes method and the volatility in the elevated price of our stock raises the amount that you actually expense. We're very, I think, conservative in the way we award options and now restricted units as well. The total units awarded has come down over the years as a percentage of outstanding fully diluted shares. Total units is just fractionally above 1% now and when you consider that on a net basis or after proceeds from stock options in the tax benefit, it's under 1%. So this is not a case of us awarding additional options or restricted units, the absolute number and the number as a percentage of outstanding shares is something we track very, very closely and it's actually come down over the years. It's just a function of the way the accounting is calculated.
Operator: The next question will come from Alex Zukin of Piper Jaffray.
Alex Zukin: So, maybe just starting on the guidance. I think, is it possible, Brian, to get a sense for what the expectations are for MicroPact that are embedded in the guidance. And can you speak to maybe how we should be thinking about the growth of MicroPact in '19 and also maybe the implied organic growth guidance that you've provided and then I've got a quick follow up?
Lynn Moore: Sure. And besides, MicroPact there are the tail of several other acquisitions including Socrata for the first quarter of the year that were made in '18 that are included in the inorganic growth in that number. We've said MicroPact's revenues for the last year, we're little north of $70 million, somewhere between 70 million, 75 million. It's is been in the last year a, low single-digit grower. We do expect that growth to accelerate over time. But our expectation in the first year is that there will be pretty modest growth. And the midpoint of our guidance would imply organic growth in total, I'd say, in the 8.5% to 9% range, and again relatively modest growth. On micro packed in the first year. We do believe MicroPact will be neutral to modestly accretive in terms of earnings. But the 2018 acquisitions in the aggregate are continued to be dilutive in 2019.
Alex Zukin: And then maybe just a quick follow-up, a two-part question. If you think about the organic growth guidance for '19 and you think about the backdrop of the demand environment, the competitive environment. The acquisitions that you've done, can you maybe just give us a sense for the level of conservatism in that guide and what could drive outperformance there. And then the follow up would be for John. As we think about returning to an ability to actually see margin leverage. Again, not in fiscal '19 is, that presumably a fiscal '20 event or is it even further in the future than that?
Lynn Moore: I'll start with the factors earn in the guidance, I don't think our philosophy has changed. We generally tried to be realistic in our guidance relative to our plan and take into account that what is a reasonably likely range of expectations in terms of opportunities and risks that are embedded in there. Again as in the last couple of years, probably it's a biggest factor and where we fall in that range is the mix between license and subscription and the new business market. And we see as our revenues have grown, we've widened the range a bit in terms of our initial guidance and we typically narrow it as we go through the year. But, because so much of our revenues now is recognized upfront on a license deal and certainly over time on a subscription deal, it has a pretty significant impact as you know how that mix falls out. So, that'd be the biggest factor certainly timing of deals as well. We have pretty consistent win rates. But, once we win a deal or awarded it, sometimes there are a lot of factors, particularly as we get into more and more larger deals that make the timing of ultimately signing it and recognizing it less predictable and we've seen that particularly in the fourth quarters in recent years.
John Marr: The second half of the question regarding our elevated spend on R&D and other investments is certainly a very good question. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks, the cash flow characteristics of the company are both very good and very predictable and high visibility. And we've certainly spent a lot of our time on how we want to deploy that capital and we've talked a lot about acquisitions, which we were successful on executing on in '18 and already off to a pretty strong start here in '19. We're active again in our repurchase program. And then third leg of that stool is the organic investment and the Company internally, which has been elevated as well. Obviously, the difference in those spends are the organic investment for the most part, virtually all of that is expensed through the P&L and its elevated, so, its drag on earnings, whereas the other two are just seen as investments. These are important investments. We've got the capital to deploy, investing in our products, widening the mode and protecting ourselves against competitive threats out there, things we feel strongly and in fact I think it's something we probably do better than the other two. We compete with a lot of [indiscernible] owned assets, a lot of financial-owned assets that can't necessarily just invest in products and build new products. That's what we do, we do it well. We have pretty good certainty on the outcomes. And so, I think we have a strategic advantage and we'll continue to do that. The last couple of years have certainly been elevated beyond what we would have expected. That's a reflection of the opportunity we've seen in our products and we think it's a good investment to make although again, it's elevated relative to expectations we may have set. My expectation would be that this would normalize, that we would grow into the current R&D spend. I don't see the absolute dollars coming down. I see it's growing into it, and therefore the margin is expanding. But I'd be cautious to say that it will happen later in '19 or in 2020 because of those opportunities are there, we'll fund them and we certainly don't want restrict it ourselves. But my expectation would be that, yes, later this year and into 2020, more than likely we'll start to see that normalize and see the margins accelerate again. But again, if we see valid opportunities for further investment, then we'll certainly fund those. Lynn used the phrase couple of times on the call, acquisition and investments, which I think what we mean, we acquire companies and then we invest in that. And the focus usually are on the acquisitions we did last year or the year before. Socrata or these deals, which are not yet real constructive in terms of their contribution within the company. But if you look back a few more years and you look at names like ExecuTime or Brazos or Wiznet which became our e-filing product or Brazos, names that have faded. They all have revenues that are multiples of what their revenues were when we acquired them and margins that are probably at least double what they were when they acquired and that's the model. So, we're in an investment cycle now, we have a record of both the inorganic and organic investments paying off. We are on a high investment cycle. We expect to grow into that over the next 18 months or so. But again, we're not shying away from the investment opportunities we're actually looking for them and when the valid incredible will continue to fund them. So I appreciate that's a little uncertain, but that's the way we look at things.
Operator: Next we have a question from Scott Berg of Needham & Company.
Jeff Riley: This is Jeff Riley for Scott Berg. So just starting off here. How are you thinking about going to market with MicroPact once the transaction closes? How do you plan to cross sell that product into your existing customer base? And then can you talk about how the acquisition expands your TAM and what your thoughts are with the opportunity to expand into the federal market? Thank you.
Lynn Moore: Good questions. MicroPact has got a pretty extensive sales force in their markets. They also have been fairly successful with a partnership model. They've been developing that for a number of years. Something that we have not historically done. They are starting to see some traction with that and some success. I expect them to continue to sell in their market the way they have historically sold and expect it over the coming years where we learn some competencies from them. In terms of cross sell, I don't believe there's any necessarily immediate cross-sell opportunities. I do believe we have products that will certainly play in the space that they play, good example, Socrata and they're already in the federal space, already in a lot of these agencies where they're at, and I'd expect those opportunities to arise. I'll let Brian talk little bit about the TAM that we've seen with MicroPact.
Brian Miller: MicroPact focuses on the case management, which is their interpretation and there is much broader than our historical interpretation where we focus on court case management. But, broadly case management and business process management. That market, we believe in total, is about an $8 billion market in the U.S., of which about $2 billion is in the government sector. So, that's really the TAM expansion that we see immediately from MicroPact. So, that's not at all in our space. And about roughly half of that, about $900 million of that government TAM is in the federal space and about 1.1 billion is in the state and local space. And that really is the expansion that we get immediately from the MicroPact acquisition.
Operator: Next we have a question from Rob Oliver of Baird.
Rob Oliver: One for Lynn or John to start, and then, Brian a quick follow-up for you. I just wanted to step back a little bit that I know at the beginning in response to Brendan's question, you guys talked about the white space initiative. But I just wanted to understand a little bit better just a thought process and rationale about the expansion into federal. Obviously, you guys really dominate local and municipal federal as a much more competitive area and with a lot of embedded players and I know MicroPact is a software solution, which it looks like can be leveraged across multiple areas and likely potentially on the HHS side into your core basis, well eventually I'd like to hear about that. But, just wanted to just step back and maybe get your thoughts on this move with Socrata and now MicroPact into federal?
Lynn Moore: Sure, Rob. And I guess I want to caution, while they do a significant amount of business in the federal space, there're not limited to the federal space. They also play more at the state level. We're not really active, while we have some statewide engagements, we don't really play at the state agency level. I would say that historically over the years, we've looked at both the federal and the state market as something of interest to us. It's adjacent to our market. But frankly we've never really found the right opportunity to make the move in that market. And when we looked at the Company like MicroPact and again we've looked at a lot of companies over the years. When we looked at a company like MicroPact, it looked a lot like Tyler, it looked a lot like the Company going back 20 years ago when we would maybe go into a new space, whether it be moving into appraisal and tax or the court space or whatever is, we were looking for a flagship company, good solid revenue base, good products, but most importantly, really good strong management team, a team with a culture that's very similar to Tyler. We take moving into a new space very seriously and not something that we would certainly dip our toe in lightly, which is why we've really waited for the right player. Micropact checked all those boxes. We spent a lot of time with these people, really got to understand the market, understand the things they do well. We believe it's a really good complementary fit. I do believe long term, there are some other opportunities as you mentioned Socrata as well. But I think it's just a natural extension. We're still focused on public sector and that's what we've always done. We believe they've done a great job in the federal space as well as the state space. I think what's interesting about them as well is that when we looked at companies in the past, they have tended to be more project oriented as opposed to product-oriented and that's certainly away from our business model. The fact that they are product-oriented company also really aligns with our underlying business model. So we saw those synergies and we think it's going to be good long-term.
Rob Oliver: And then, Brian. Just a quick follow-up for you. I know you've mentioned throughout the call. Just some of the impact or headwinds from the shorter durations -- get back to bookings for shorter durations. And just wanted to get a sense for, there's is likely a positive at the other end of this with some more flexibility on price for you guys and just wanted to talk a little bit about what you're seeing on the pricing side and what you expect to see play out there on the shorter durations?
Lynn Moore: Yes, with our software subscription arrangements, typically those contracts or very often, they are a fixed annual fee for the initial term. And so there's not, even though in the economics there may be embedded annual increases that are averaged out to get a level annual payment and therefore level annual revenue recognition there. They effectively don't show growth during that initial terms, so we have a chunk of revenues with each of these contracts that doesn't grow into it gets to the end of the initial term. And then we expect that generally that we would have increases that are similar to the increases we get in maintenance, low-to-mid single digit annual increases that encompass an increasing level of features and functionality that they get through that Evergreen model that we deliver our software under. So it does a couple of things, it shortens the period in which that we have that no-growth revenues and gets us on a regular cadence of increases more rapidly and provides us with long-term flexibility that we're not locked into pricing for five years or seven years when there could be uncertainty over our costs over that period. So you're correct that as our older, longer-term subscription arrangements roll-off and we get on a cadence of more regular increases in that base of revenues. It should go from a headwind to revenue growth to providing a benefit to our annual revenue growth.
Operator: The next question comes from Jonathan Ho, William Blair & Company.
Jonathan Ho: I just wanted to maybe did in a little bit in terms of how you see the opportunity to maybe accelerate the growth around micro focus. It was just a function of investing more in the product, are there other things that you can do and what do you ultimately see is the ability to. I guess invest in and micro-focus just based on what you're seeing today?
Lynn Moore: As we mentioned, we will continue to invest in MicroPact, they have been going through a little bit of a replatforming of their product. And and that's it's shown well, it's already been sold, it's out in the market, it's doing really well. I think if that product continues to become more robust and more configurable, it will help accelerate growth. Like we said, they've been working on a partner network for a number of number of years, that is starting to bear fruit. They have some international opportunities that are coming out of that partner network. So I think the market's good, their position in the market is good, both in the federal and the state and we see it was a good growth driver down the road.
Jonathan Ho: And then just in terms of the follow up,, I guess when we look at the duration impacts to bookings in 2018, do we expect there to be further I guess reduction in the duration in 2019 -- do we just flap the current effects, I just want to get a sense of how that will extend from the '18 to the '19 timeframe?
Lynn Moore: I think there's probably a little impact ongoing. There is a mix of and we really put the new standard terms in place in the first quarter, but you have proposals out there already of contracts in process. And so it takes a little while before you've fully rolled it out. We certainly have some contracts that are longer than that, longer than the standard three year initial term. We have some that are shorter in some aspects. We have one year subscription arrangements. So I think it will continue to sort itself out. I don't think it will be as dramatic we seem to be settling in closer to this four year average term. But I think because we didn't really started and with a hard start on January 1, some continued impact until we settle in at the level that we'll ultimately be at.
Operator: The next question will come from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Brendan on for Keith. Guys I just want to ask quick question about the New World products. You mentioned before you are thinking about how to upgrade the capabilities and target the Tier 1 space. And just wanted an update on how far along you guys are in those efforts? And anything specifically that you had to do to upgrade the product? Thanks.
Lynn Moore: We're continuing to invest in the New World products. I guess the short answer is, is that those investments are paying off. We've seen significant product adoption in our sales this year, both across the board and CAD records and our Patriot mobility. We see increases in our pipeline right now, they're up significantly year-over-year. We talked earlier about some deal slippage, that's the good news -- bad news about what we've been doing is we've actually been expanding our market, we've been expanding the pipeline. So there were a greater number of deals that we were trying to chase in Q4. It's an evolving process, just like a lot of development efforts, but we're continuing to invest, we continue to make progress. I don't think it's something that you say overnight. Now we're there, that's not R&D work. We just, we keep investing and we keep growing the TAM.
Brian Miller: I think the key is back when we acquired New World as we went into 2017. So two years ago, we've launched a couple of major development efforts with respect to Public Safety aimed at both adding features and functionality and separating ourselves from the other competitors in our traditional mid-market space, but also adding that functionality that we needed to compete effectively at the upper end of the market, and those projects are well along and we've had releases along the way we've certainly seen impacts very positively on the win rates in our traditional mid market space. And I think we're just now getting to the point where we think that we have the ability now to actually check off the boxes in larger opportunities and say, yes, we meet those requirements. But having said that, the timeline is long. So if we respond to say an RFP and the larger opportunity early in 2019, that decision may not be made until late 2020 given the length of the sales cycles and they are longer and larger deals. So it could really be 2021 before you start to see real awards and revenues from those upper tier customers, literally four to five years after we launched the development projects. So this is a space that requires patience that we have and we see progress along the way that we're very pleased with, but actually seeing it show up in financial statements is a long prospect.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI.
Kirk Materne: John, I appreciate your color and around M&A and the philosophy on that. I was wondering if you could just give us any color or you, Lynn, could give us any color or you, Lynn, could give us some color actually on what you guys think about from a return perspective on M&A, meaning as you stack these deals on top of each other, we don't necessarily get to see the return New World's had from a profitability perspective. And given how fragmented your market is, I would think there's almost a never ending opportunity for you all to do M&A. So how do you think about getting the right return on prior deals before going into a new one. I'm sure there's some thought process there, but if M&A is going to be a more regular part of the dialog, it'd just be helpful to have some color on that front?
Lynn Moore: Yes. It varies based on the types of deals we're doing. As we've said in recent years, we've really shifted largely away from consolidation plays, which really was more of an intrinsic valuation approach and return on the assets you're purchasing the way you might think. So we are very disciplined in that case, multiples of EBITDA and sales and what they might do for us. And discount in the cash flows, further on but a traditional approach to that. There aren't a lot of significant consolidation plays out there doing very small, there's a lot of $3 million, $5 million, $8 million companies with 60% of their revenues are recurring, that's the book you're buying. And there just isn't a lot of that, there is a lot of PE firms and even at couple public firms that target those. So we've really moved away from those which really employed more of the traditional return on investment approach that you're alluding to. I won't say we're not disciplined, I think we've always been disciplined and certainly lose out on some deals because of that discipline, but we've certainly I guess loosened a little bit our model on strategic acquisitions, especially smaller strategic acquisitions. So I mentioned exactly time earlier probably few of us even remember that acquisition from a number of years ago. Very small few million dollars in revenue, we bought it at a reasonable price point, but the reality is, when five years later those revenues start to accelerate and the revenues there are several times what they were acquired at, the margin starts to expand because of the scale, they've improved the competitive position of your other products in those areas like Munis and Incode. You could say it almost doesn't matter too much how much you paid for them initially. So it's a difficult thing to quantify, on the strategic side, and I would say within that. We paid $10 million for that and it's obviously our e-file -- products are worth hundreds and hundreds of millions, maybe you could argue $1 billion in segment of our total market cap. So those are the deals we're looking for and that's the way we'd look at it that five and six years out, when they hit scale, when they're growing at a good rate, when their margins are Tyler-like and then you back into what their proportionate valuation within Tyler's $8 billion market cap is, they are very, very compelling. And those are the deals we're looking for those, that's why we invest in them in those early years after we acquire them and we're looking for that return down the road.
Kirk Materne: I guess the question is, is this just over the next three to five years, given the opportunity in front of you. The operating margin expansion story, I think longer term that that seems to still makes sense, but it seems like in the near term, maybe, call it three to five years. If this is going to be more of an investment mode for you guys. Operating margin is a little bit secondary to getting the right assets and the right portfolio put together. Is that fair?
Lynn Moore: Maybe, but you can have a hard time getting our management team that we've worked real hard to support these investments. And I'll be honest with you right now. I appreciate the market likes investment, you follow a lot of companies that aren't that focused on margins. Some aren't even profitable and are highly valued. We're really not culturally that company. So for us to support those investments, we really have to be convinced and have a high level of confidence that it's going to pay off. We refer to this as a cycle. I think we're in a high investment cycle right now. There are a number of opportunities in our own core products, as well as these acquisitions we've done and the incremental investments that should be made in order for them to realize their potential that we're supporting. I think that cycle will cycle out and will be in a period of time. So right now ideally, you'd have the right balance all the time, whatever it is 80% have reached some level of maturity that reach, scale, the margins are expanding , et cetera, et cetera, and you've got the right level of investment organically and inorganically. Right now, we've got a higher percentage of that in the investment mode and that's putting some pressure on margins, I think that pendulum will swing back and forth and will return certainly to and expanding a margin situation. I took exception to one word in the script is that consistent margin expansion. Well that's not really what we have. I think over the long-term, we have certain margin expansion, but it is a little inconsistent.
Kirk Materne: And then if I could sneak one in for Brian for all of you. Just on the buyback, obviously, the MicroPact acquisition, they'll draw down some of your liquidity. Would you all go into it debt position to fund the buyback if the situation unveiled itself. I'm just how I guess how bound are you by your cash balance as it relates to your buyback? Thanks.
Lynn Moore: I think Peter the answer is absolutely, yes, we would, depending on the opportunity. If you look at our history, we've done it before. We did it six, seven years ago. We took out a line of credit, specifically to buy back stock and tap that line to do so. So the good news is we do experience good cash flow. Our cash flow is fairly certain and predictable in the out years. We take that into account, when we look at all of our investments, including acquisitions and stock buybacks. So, we wouldn't be timid if the market opportunity was there. So like I said, we've done in the past.
Brian Miller: You can look back to early '16 the last time we were really active in that first part of 2016 and we had some debt on the balance sheet following the New World acquisition and we used more debt to buy stock back when we thought there was a more compelling opportunity in the short term. I don't think we'd ever be what you described as heavily leveraged for buybacks. But, we're not opposed to using debt if we see the opportunity is compelling enough.
Kirk Materne: Great, thanks for answering the questions.
Brian Miller: Just to add on that those so Kirk, we've done in the past is as Brian and Lynn both indicated, we certainly would be comfortable, we maintain our working capital line now, so we have plenty of access to capital. But we also know the investors we attract investing in quality companies and part of that is a strong balance sheet. So I think as Brian said, we would never be over-levered and I think more than likely that would incur to do an acquisition to repurchase our stock or whatever investment we felt was compelling enough to support would be pretty much on a temporary basis that a permanent debt situation is unlikely for us.
Operator: Our next question comes from Peter Lowry of JMP Securities.
Peter Lowry: Two quick questions, first of the several slipped public safety deals that have closed subsequent to Q4, is that a pace that is encouraging, discouraging or neutral at this point in the year. And then second, can you remind me the mix of which revenue line items the MicroPact acquisition will show up in? Thanks.
Brian Miller: I think it's probably neutral. The timing of their deals we had been awarded going into the fourth quarter or were awarded in the fourth quarter. Some of those and that really happens every quarter we have deals that slipped for a variety of reasons, there are lot of factors around doing business, the public sector even down to when is that last council meeting and the City Attorney get it on the agenda, are you able to round up all the signatures in time and sometimes the urgency isn't there on the clients part or and those deals slip we see that a lot of times, where in the fourth quarter, though where public safety has a bigger proportion of this business, it has a bigger impact. But I don't think it particularly changes our plan this year, we'll likely see the same scenario next year in the fourth quarter. And so I'd say it's relatively neutral. The MicroPact revenue mix, their business , actually their mix is fairly similar to the Tyler mix. They're about -- I'd say their plan for this year is somewhere around 17% of the revenues are licenses, about 30% services, little bit heavier on services, little bit heavier on services. 10% subscriptions, low to mid 40s, 43% say maintenance. So, not too dissimilar from Tyler's current mix.
Lynn Moore: And on the public safety deals, I think this happens all the time up and down our market and we have lots of divisions where deals come in, deals go out. For public safety I think as the volume of deals is which we've been talking about the last couple of years as their win rates go up, the volumes going up, the number of deals in their pipeline. I think you'd just start to see some of that balance out to where when deals start slipping, they actually start getting funnel back on the other side. And I think I would expect that as you look out over time, you'd have less of this discussion or focus on that.
Operator: The next question comes from Mark Schappel of Benchmark.
Mark Schappel: Brian, a question for you on the Public Safety business follow-up to the prior question, but this business has its ups and downs here. And just wondering if you could just give us some ideas or some of the changes you're making in that business with respect to go-to-market market activities as well as maybe product development to try to get that business to perform a little better?
Lynn Moore: Well, I think over the time since we've acquired New World. We've made some changes in their sales organization. We have a different sales leadership there. I think we've aligned some of the sales processes more closely with the way Tyler's has historically done things. But they're executing very well. I mean the win rates have basically doubled since the time we acquired them to where they are today. I think that's a combination of the investments we've made in the Company organizationally to support organization and the sales organization, and certainly the investments we're making in the product, are clearly having an impact on the market that road map and those things that we've released along the way. And I think the Tyler brand, the integration with other Tyler products, particularly our Courts & Justice, soft code, Brazos, all of those things have a positive impact on there. So, it is a market that is highly competitive and it's a market that also is a little more seasonal in terms of the activity toward the latter part of the year. But I think we're pleased with the progress we've made with the execution in that division and I think some of this just a short-term inconsistency will play out and that this is going to be a business that over the longer term grows faster than Tyler's core business. Right now, that's not the case, but as we've talked about some of these other investments where we make investments in acquired companies and it's a multi-year process to see those pay off. And as we look at the milestones that we've accomplished along the way, we feel very good about where the Public Safety business is today.
Operator: At this time, there appear to be no more questions. Mr. Marr, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.
John Marr: Okay, thank you and thank you all for joining us on the call today. Appreciate your interest. If there are any further questions, feel free to contact Lynn Moore, Brian Miller or myself. Thanks, again. Have a great day.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Hello, and welcome to today's Tyler Technologies Third Quarter 2018 Conference Call. Your host for today's call is John Marr, Chairman of Tyler Technologies. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded as of today, November 01, 2018. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Marr. Mr. Marr, please go ahead.
John S. Marr - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Thank you, and welcome to our third quarter 2018 earnings call. With me on the call today are; Lynn Moore, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like for Brian to give the Safe Harbor statement. Next, Lynn will have some preliminary comments. Then Brian will review the details of our third quarter results and update our 2018 guidance. Then I'll have some final comments and we'll take your questions. Brian?
Brian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Thanks, John. During the course of this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information that may include projections concerning the company's future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the requirements of ASU No. 2014-09, Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, utilizing the full retrospective method of transition. Prior year amounts have been restated from previously reported amounts to reflect the impact of the full retrospective adoption of Topic 606. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless we specify otherwise. Lynn?
H. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Thanks, Brian. Our third quarter earnings were in line with our expectations and cash flow exceeded expectations, even though revenues were somewhat below plan. Total GAAP revenues grew 10% and non-GAAP revenues grew 10.5%, with 6.5% organic growth. We continue to experience exceptional growth in our cloud-based business, as GAAP subscription revenues grew 32% and non-GAAP subscription revenues grew 35%. Total recurring revenues from maintenance and subscriptions grew 14% and comprised 66% of total revenue. From a product perspective, growth for our enterprise products, which include ERP, appraisal and tax, and civic services, exceeded expectations. We continue to experience strong win rates and industry-leading competitive positions for these products, with significant scale and generally deep sales pipelines. Growth for our justice products, which include Courts and Public Safety, lagged expectations. We have a number of new Courts & Justice initiatives that we are confident will provide long-term growth, including new offerings like Modria, re:Search and redaction as well as international expansion. However, revenues from those offerings are initially less predictable and have come online more slowly than planned. We continue to have success in winning new public safety clients. And the total value of new name public safety contracts signed year-to-date is up 34% over 2017. However, we are also pursuing some larger and more complex opportunities with our New World solutions. The sales process from a number of those deals has been prolonged, affecting the timing of not only license revenues but also the associated professional services and maintenance revenues. It's also important to note that approximately half of the new public safety contract value for the year is expected to be signed in the fourth quarter, which, if executed, will contribute to an expected acceleration of our growth rate in the fourth quarter. Our long-term view of the opportunity in the public safety space is more positive than ever. And our investments in the New World product suite are clearly resonating with clients and prospects and positively affecting win rates. Our largest new license deal of the quarter was with Lubbock County, Texas, valued at $10 million for a comprehensive suite of solutions, including Munis enterprise resource planning, New World Public Safety records management and computer-aided dispatch, Brazos e-citation, SoftCode Civil Process, Odyssey court case management including Tyler Corrections, and Odyssey Jury, Prosecutor, and Pretrial. These Tyler Alliance solutions will manage Lubbock County's entire justice process from dispatch to disposition. With the addition of these products to the Tyler solutions they already use, Lubbock County will become one of the most comprehensive users of Tyler software in the nation. Also in the quarter, we signed a $7 million deal with Loudoun County, Virginia, for our EnerGov Civic Services solution. The county will replace its 20-year old legacy land management information system with our EnerGov Community Development suite to streamline and automate its enterprise land management, permitting, and development review process. Loudoun County also uses our iasWorld property tax solution. Other significant on-premises license deals signed during the quarter, each with a total contract value of $1 million or more, included Knox County, Tennessee, for our Munis ERP and iasWorld appraisal solutions; Des Moines, Iowa, for our EnerGov solution; contracts with Hays County, Texas, and the Bi-County Police Information Network in Washington State for our New World Public Safety solution; Norwood, Massachusetts, for our Munis ERP solution; and Casper, Wyoming, for our Munis ERP, EnerGov, and ExecuTime solutions. The New World Public Safety contracts signed this quarter in Lubbock, Hays, Cameron, and Gillespie counties in Texas represent major new inroads into the Texas market, where New World has previously not had a significant presence. Significant new SaaS contracts in the quarter included Columbus, Georgia, Consolidated Government for our Odyssey Court Case Management solution; contracts for our Munis ERP solutions with the cities of Roswell, New Mexico, and New London, Connecticut, and the East Side Union High School District in San Jose, California; and Blue Earth County, Minnesota, for our iasWorld appraisal solution. We also signed a three-year contract with the Texas Office of Courts Administration valued at $5 million to provide redaction and value-added attorney services as an addition to the existing e-filing arrangement. During the quarter, we also announced the availability of the New World ShieldForce mobile application. ShieldForce makes real-time and mission-critical data for public safety agencies available instantly, ultimately improving their situational awareness and overall safety. The application provides a vital connection between patrol officers, dispatchers, and command staff by extending computer-aided dispatch functionality onto a smartphone, tablet, or watch. ShieldForce is just one example of innovation we're bringing to market through our increased investments in R&D. Now, I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results of the quarter and update our annual guidance for 2018.
Brian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Thanks, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2018. I'm going to provide some additional data on the quarter's performance and update our annual guidance for 2018. And then John will have some additional comments. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. These measures exclude write-downs of acquisition related deferred revenue and acquired leases, share-based compensation expense, the employer portion of payroll taxes on employee stock transactions, and amortization of acquired intangibles. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financial Reports tab schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. GAAP revenues for the quarter were $236.1 million, up 9.9%. GAAP organic revenue growth was 6.6%. On a non-GAAP basis, revenues were $237.6 million, up 10.5% with a 6.5% organic growth. Subscription revenues for the quarter increased 32.3%. We added 81 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 31 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $29.2 million in total contract value. In Q3 of last year, we added 94 new subscription-based arrangements and had 15 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $42.5 million in total contract value. Subscription clients represented approximately 47% of the number of new software contracts in the quarter compared to 49% in the prior year quarter, while subscription contract value comprised 37% of the total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 51% in Q3 of last year. The value-weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 3.6 years, compared to 5.4 years in Q3 of last year. Transaction-based revenues from e-filing and online payments, which are included in subscriptions, increased 16.4% to $17.9 million from $15.4 million last year. That amount includes e-filing revenue of $13.3 million, up 12.2% over last year. Annualized total non-GAAP recurring revenues for Q3 were approximately $625 million, up 14.6%. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $1.2 billion, up 7.3%. Backlog included $355 million of maintenance, compared to $340 million a year ago. Subscription backlog was $488 million compared to $443 million last year, and includes approximately $128 million related to fixed fee e-filing contracts. Our bookings for this quarter, which are calculated from the change in backlog plus non-GAAP revenues, were approximately $255 million, a decrease of 5.2% from Q3 of last year. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1 billion, up 17.9%. As we noted earlier, the weighted average term of new software subscription agreements this quarter was 3.6 years compared to 5.4 years last year, as we have moved to standardize on shorter initial subscription terms for most of our software offerings to provide greater pricing flexibility. The combination of a lower mix of subscription contracts and a shorter term for new subscriptions negatively affected our bookings growth. If the initial term for this quarter's subscription bookings had been the same as last year, our bookings growth would've been 260 basis points higher. In addition, last year's Q3 bookings included a $12 million contract for re:Search in Illinois. Our software subscription bookings in the quarter added $5.6 million in new annual recurring revenue, down 10.4% from $6.3 million last year. For comparison, if all of our subscription contracts had been under license arrangements, we estimate that they would have represented additional license bookings of approximately $6.5 million. We signed 29 new contracts in the quarter that included software licenses greater than $100,000 and those contracts had an average license of $465,000, compared to 32 new contracts with an average license value of $381,000 in the third quarter of 2017. Cash flow from operations grew 20.8% to $112.1 million and surpassed $100 million in a quarter for the first time. Free cash flow, which is calculated as cash from operations less capital expenditures, was $103.6 million, up nearly 22%. Our CapEx for the quarter was $8.5 million including approximately $215,000 related to real estate, compared to total CapEx of $7.6 million in Q3 of last year, which included $3.6 million related to real estate. We ended the quarter with $315.3 million in cash and investments and no outstanding debt. Days sales outstanding in accounts receivable were 107 days at September 30, 2018, compared to 94 days at September 30, 2017. Excluding unbilled receivables, DSOs were 79 days at September 30, 2018, compared to 74 days at September 30, 2017. Our guidance for the full year of 2018 is as follows. We expect 2018 GAAP revenues will be between $934 million and $944 million, and non-GAAP revenues will be between $940 million and $950 million. We expect 2018 GAAP diluted EPS will be between $3.63 and $3.71 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock option exercises on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect 2018 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $4.76 and $4.84. For the year, estimated pre-tax noncash share-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $55 million. We expect R&D expense for the year will be between $62 million and $64 million. Fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between 40.2 million and 40.5 million shares. GAAP earnings per share assumes an estimated annual effective tax rate of 4% after discrete tax items and includes approximately $36 million of discrete tax benefits primarily related to share-based compensation which may vary significantly based on the timing and volume of stock option exercises. Our estimated non-GAAP annual effective tax rate for 2018 is 24%. This rate was reduced from 35% for 2017 to reflect the enactment of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act. We expect our total capital expenditures will be between $23 million and $26 million for the year. Total depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $62 million, including approximately $40 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Now I'd like to turn the call over to John for his comments.
John S. Marr - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Thanks, Brian. Tyler continued to execute at a high level in the third quarter. We achieved double-digit revenue growth for the 28th consecutive quarter. We're pleased that we were able to grow non-GAAP operating income for the quarter, while increasing our R&D spend 44% and absorbing acquisitions that are mostly dilutive this year. Our non-GAAP earnings guidance for the year is unchanged from the second quarter when we adjusted it upward from our initial outlook. Although we have revised our revenue guidance to slightly lower the upper end of the range, we expect organic and total revenue growth to accelerate in the fourth quarter. At the midpoint of our non-GAAP revenue guidance, total revenue growth for the fourth quarter would be approximately 14% and organic revenue growth would be approximately 9%. As Lynn noted earlier, our enterprise products are performing exceptionally well. Revenues for the second half of the year from these products are exceeding expectations with solid double-digit growth from what are some of our more mature products. For our justice products, second half growth is below our plan in part, because we've reduced our outlook for revenues from new initiatives to drive long-term growth. Although these revenues have proven to be less predictable and slower to develop, the market has been very receptive to these offerings and recent activity is encouraging. For re:Search, we have contracts with Texas, Illinois and New Mexico and we signed contracts this quarter with 14 counties in Georgia. The lack of precedents is driving longer than expected timeframes to turn on value-added services for attorneys. For redaction, we signed a three-year contract with Texas this quarter and with pilot project starting in both Texas and New Mexico, we expect to expand across our client base from there. With Modria, we have signed several contracts including major clients like Clark County, Nevada and Los Angeles County, California and have several pilot projects underway. For the lack of precedents for online dispute resolution is resulting in smaller pilot projects than originally expected. Initial results have surpassed client expectations and we expect that these early successes will lead to expanded use and a greater contribution to growth in 2019 as our sales pipeline is strong. We continue to make significant progress with integrating Socrata, now known as our data and insights division. The new Socrata Connected Government Cloud has resonated with the market since its release earlier this year and we've signed seven new contracts for SCGC in the quarter, adding new clients at the federal, state and local levels. We're also successfully cross-selling Socrata through our other Tyler divisions and are building a strong pipeline through other Tyler channels. While investing in product development at a high level, we've also completed two additional acquisitions that add native cloud solutions with important functionality, one in the third quarter and one in early October for a total combined purchase price of approximately $14 million in cash. CaseloadPRO acquired August 31 strengthens the probation and supervision offerings in our justice suite. MobileEyes, acquired October 1, adds valuable solutions for fire protection and inspections. We continue to pursue additional strategic acquisition opportunities to broaden our capabilities, expand our addressable markets, and enhance growth. As we noted earlier, Q3 was a record quarter for cash flow. The strength of our balance sheet and consistency of our cash flow give us a great deal of flexibility to deploy capital and create value. While we did not repurchase our stock in the third quarter, we have since resumed buyback activity and have repurchased approximately 155,000 shares of our common stock in October. We currently have remaining authorization to repurchase 1.8 million shares. Finally, in October, we launched our newly redesigned website, which is easier to navigate and provides a vastly improved visitor experience compared to our previous site. We invite you to visit our website at tylertech.com and explore the new content. Now we'll take your questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question today comes from Alexis Huseby with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.
Peter J. Heckmann - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Hey. Good morning. This is actually Pete Heckmann. Had a question, Brian. So just to be clear, on a constant term basis of about 5.4 years, bookings would have been down about 2.5% year-over-year? Is that how I interpret your comment?
Brian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: That's correct.
Peter J. Heckmann - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. And then just on the LTM bookings growth, are you comparing bookings under 606 to bookings under 605? I'm seeing a lower growth number on the LTM than 18%?
Brian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Those should be both 606 numbers, so everything should be restated for 606. We have a schedule of bookings that's posted on the website, but those should all be restated 606 bookings. It does include adding Socrata into the backlog as well, so that's included in that number, the new number.
Peter J. Heckmann - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Got it. Okay, okay. That's helpful. And then as regards Socrata, did Socrata generate sequentially higher revenue in the third quarter?
Brian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Sequentially higher than from Q2 to Q3?
Peter J. Heckmann - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Yes.
Brian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: I believe that's the case. Socrata's revenues did increase significantly from Q2 to Q3. Although for us really it was only in a month in Q2, so it's a little hard to compare the two months before Tyler to the month after, but generally Socrata revenues are increasing, and also looking at a fairly significant increase in Q4 over Q3.
Peter J. Heckmann - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Scott Berg with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.
Scott Berg - Needham & Co. LLC: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Lynn, I wanted to start off with the comments on the Public Safety business. Is – that business I know is more weighted towards the back half of the year than your other products. So I guess it's not a surprise that Q4 is heavier there. But as you look at the bookings opportunity there with your expectations on Q4, how does that compare for the entire year versus your beginning of the year expectations?
H. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Well, I think our expectations are still strong in Public Safety. As I think we mentioned in the comments, the second half and Q4 in particular has a large number of new clients. I think about half of their new licenses are really scheduled to be signed in Q4. I think overall in 2018, licenses in Public Safety are looking to be up around 25%, 30%, new names are up maybe 10% to 12%, and really the deal size is growing as well. I think the average size deal year-over-year is up in the 55%, 60%. So overall, I think what's going on at Public Safety is good. We just had – they just had their largest user conference, the IACP. Our new products are showing well. The integrations that we're showing with Socrata, there's a lot of excitement around what we can do with the Socrata Public Safety analytics. So generally speaking, it's the trends there are still looking good.
Scott Berg - Needham & Co. LLC: Yeah. We attended that conference and came away pretty positive on it. So that's why just seeking commentary there. It sounds like you're feeling pretty comfortable at least with that business over the near term. Yeah. And then the last question I have is around Socrata. You've had the asset for five months. It sounds like you're starting to sell it well. But five months later, any differences in opinion in the opportunity there, whether positive or on the negative side? Or is it kind of right in line with initial expectations?
H. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: I'd say right now it's right in line with expectations. There is a lot of excitement, I think internally in Tyler and as well in the market. I think I mentioned in the call last quarter, one thing that we've been doing is we've been looking at opportunities within Tyler and we've been working on product roadmaps for each division and how Socrata is really going to integrate with each of the different divisions. And so we're still finalizing those and prioritizing those. I think we're looking to hopefully come out with some new products in the very near term and show some new stuff at the Connect user conference next year.
Scott Berg - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. That's all I have. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: The next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Kirk, your line is open.
Kirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC: Oh, sorry about that. Thanks. Thanks, gentlemen. Just maybe to start off with, I realize there's a lot of moving parts to the business model right now in terms of mix shifts from on-prem, the subscription and obviously the duration changes that are going to impact bookings. But, can you just maybe level set where you think you are at this point this year versus your initial expectations in January? It sounds like justice is maybe a little bit slower than you hoped, maybe at the beginning of the year. Other things it sounds like you guys are very upbeat about. I'm just trying to get a level set on kind of your expectations about how you are executing against sort of the full year plan and then just so we understand that because it's obviously harder to get a real view into that just by looking at bookings right now? Thanks.
John S. Marr - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. I think that's a good question. Obviously, there are some areas of softness in the second half of the year that have contributed to little lighter revenues and it's fair to kind of see how that breaks down. What I think is important to reinforce is our core businesses are performing really well. We indicated the enterprise side of the business is actually ahead of plan. And this is a little more mature side of the business, a lot of recurring revenues, a big presence in a large marketplace that flows nicely, in other words, when things move out other things tend to move in. And the business is performing very well and consistently delivering double-digit organic growth. The justice side of the business, the core business is doing well, the competitive position winning important deals. None of those things affected at all and so performing very much in line with what our expectations are, e-file revenues, maintenance revenues, no attrition, all those core fundamentals is right on track. As we've said, our core growth rate would contract if we didn't add anything else over time. We're adding a lot of things. We've talked about Modria and re:Search and redaction and international expansion, and other things adding Socrata and Sage in the inorganic growth initiatives that we have. Those things are going to be more difficult to predict and they're going to show up at different times and contribute. And that is what drives the above double-digit growth organic growth rate. And they're just a little light in the second half of the year. So, I think it's going to be difficult to project those even Public Safety that is new to Tyler and it takes several years literally to kind of Tylerize the whole business model. Well on track, but harder to predict. And so some of the softness from those growth initiatives in the second half of the year. It's important to say though that all of those are being received well in the marketplace. We don't have any question about the traction they're going to receive and we've made progress in terms of – these didn't have business models around – they really didn't have a clear value proposition and those things have all been tested and with early adopters who are being embraced. So, we feel really good about the long-term contribution that these growth initiatives will have and we feel really good that they will provide that incremental growth that consistently has the growth rates where we want them to be, even though the timing of that contribution has been a little short in the second half of this year.
Kirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC: That makes sense. Thanks, John. And then maybe – and this sort of dovetails on one of your comments, but to your point about adding a lot of new products this year, you guys have obviously been more acquisitive than I think historically, listening to just the number of products you brought on. How should we be thinking about M&A for 2019? And maybe how we should think about sort of margins as it relates to that? Is 2019 more of a year where you guys are hoping to see these products sort of gel coming to the go-to-market model and then, obviously, we hope to see some natural operating leverage from that? Thanks.
John S. Marr - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. We just don't – we'll always be excited to do great deals that make sense for the company. And we have tended to be a little more aggressive on strategic deals. We're always going to be a disciplined buyer, but obviously, some of these, especially smaller strategics, once they are embraced in our sales channel and in our customer base and if you look out a few years – if you now look back a few years at some of these, obviously, it certainly wouldn't have made sense not to do those deals because they maybe were a little more expensive than what we would've liked. So, you might see us be a little more aggressive on strategic deals that we think there will be a lot of scale and leverage in, but we'll be opportunistic. We can't start 2019 and say we have a particular target for acquisitions. If they're great, we'll do them, we'll have the capacity to do them. And if they're not, we'll be happy to be patient as well. So, it's a fair question, but we never have a quota on acquisitions. We're certainly always actively engaged in the marketplace. We're going to be able to have done a number of deals, obviously, a large deal with Socrata, but a number of smaller tuck-in strategic deals that we think have that kind of scale and leverage in the future in 2018 and we'll just have to see what 2019 brings.
Kirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC: Thanks for that. That's it for me. Thanks.
Operator: Next question comes from Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Alex J. Zukin - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey, guys. Thanks. So maybe just on those comments around Courts & Justice, if we look at, kind of, maybe just reminding us about what percentage of the total business is coming from Courts & Justice? And what the new assumptions for growth given some of the new initiatives you talked about being able to slow in the second half? What's the assumption for growth there now versus where it was? And are these execution issues? Are these kind of product quality, market demand issues? Help us categorize that? And then I've got just a quick follow-up.
John S. Marr - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Just from a percentage, Courts & Justice is right around 20% of our business with the whole suite of products.
Alex J. Zukin - Piper Jaffray & Co.: I don't think it's – go ahead Lynn.
H. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: When you look at new assumptions for growth, I think as John said these – they've got a lot of really good growth initiatives. These initiatives are being tested in the market. They're well received. The fact that there was a little bit of some delay in proving out the model, you look for example at re:Search Illinois. This was a deal that we went in the year expecting that that was going to fire up really towards the middle of the year and that thing has been pushed back, but not due to any other issues just in the fact that it's a new model out there and it just hasn't gone live yet. And so in terms of assumptions for growth going forward, we believe these initiatives are going to kick in and start contributing in the future in 2019, 2020. I would expect that C&J will continue to contribute at a pretty meaningful level and have growth kick back up into the 9%, 10%, 11%, 12% range over the next couple of years.
Alex J. Zukin - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great. And maybe just a follow-up for Brian. Can you talk about how many points of growth Socrata contributed to that LTM bookings growth number of 18%? And then how does that kind of bookings growth rate impact the prospect for continued double-digit topline growth?
Brian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: As you know, the bookings number can be very lumpy in our business. So this quarter and actually last quarter were both quarters where bookings were comprised mostly of a lot of our good volume of our sort of normal bread and butter kinds of deals. But we didn't have any of the mega deals, the deals with contract values of $20 million or $30 million that do occur from time to time. We had a couple of those last year and we have large deals in the pipeline, but their timing is somewhat random and certainly lumpy. So, again, as we have over a long period of time, we remind people to not focus too much on single quarter bookings and that would be the case this time where bookings were below last year's level even when you factor out the impact of change in the term of new subscription deals, bookings were still down a bit. There was a bit of a difficult comp in it. There was a $12 million deal in the last year's second quarter. But generally they were down slightly, but again on the trailing 12-month basis that 17%. Of that, Socrata accounted for a couple percent of that trailing 12-months bookings, so that 17% growth, about two points of that was from Socrata. So still the longer-term trailing bookings support our growth objectives that we've talked about in the sort of north of 10% range. And also to point out that the larger bookings, the big contracts are typically recognized over several years. So the revenue recognition and the bookings are very different. So we put those into backlog and then recognize them over the extended period of time, so the lumpiness has less of an effect on the revenue growth than it does on the bookings growth.
Alex J. Zukin - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Perfect. And then maybe just to sneak another one. I know there was some private equity kind of consolidation of assets in the market over the last quarter in your space which was a little bit unusually large I think versus historical periods. Any sense or early signs of what that combined entity now looks like from a competitive standpoint? What that does to the competitive environment for new products for you guys going forward?
H. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. Alex, I think we know what you're talking about. I think we've seen it even beyond this deal. Other deals, we've seen some PD firms coming into the space, I think sort of recognizing the value of the long-term recurring revenue streams. We're obviously very familiar with those assets. The Superion assets I think had been in the market now three different times in 12 years. The TriTech assets have now been in the market twice in four years. It's a little bit early. Typically, we know the private equity playbook. It's a little bit different than ours. They generally look for more of an exit in the near term, while we're looking more long-term. Obviously, this is a different type of deal, because these two firms were merging. But typically they leverage the assets pretty strong. They look for synergies. which is code for cost cutting, which can sometimes lead to a little bit of disruption in the market, both with their employees and some of the customers. We probably – we've heard a little bit anecdotally about some of that disruption. But that's about it right now. We haven't really seen any meaningful impact in the market. And other than that, we typically don't comment too much on what our competitors are doing.
Alex J. Zukin - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Next question comes from Jonathan Ho with William Blair & Company. Please go ahead.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to get a better sense from you. In order for some of the newer initiatives to pick back up or accelerate, what really has to happen here? Is this a function of having more budget set aside or education of the marketplace? Just wanted to get some color in terms of maybe what the next milestones are that we should be looking for?
H. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Well, Jonathan, I think it's – we're talking about initiatives that are really changing the way some courts are doing business. There is a little bit of education. There's a little bit of decision-making (38:34). When you look at something like Modria for example, we're taking a similar approach with Modria that we did with e-filing, which is we need to get in there, we need to get some pilots going. Then we need – then the courts adopt that. They go to more of a permissive approach. And then ultimately to a mandatory approach. Same thing with re:Search. We've got some pilots out there. The reception is good. But some of these things just take some time. It's part of a function of the market we're in. The things move slowly in our market. But certainly the excitement and the energy is out there. We've got active pilots out there. We've got active interests. We've got projects going on. So it's just a little bit of a function of time.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. And then just in terms of my follow-up. Can you give us maybe a little bit of a sense of what's happening in the spending environment? And I think you've talked about a healthy pipeline, but how should we be thinking about that just given some of the macro noise that's out there?
John S. Marr - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: I don't think there's anything – yes, there's nothing really different there, Jonathan. The market's generally steady. It's going to ebb and flow a little bit. But we're not noticing anything different in the demand side of the business. I think on the enterprise side, we think RFP and demand activity will be modestly higher this year than last year. Obviously the justice side of the business is driven by larger deals, so it's harder to compare year-over-year. But it's steady there as well. So we haven't seen any disruption on the demand side.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from Rob Oliver with Baird. Please go ahead.
Rob Oliver - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask on the R&D side of the equation, you guys entered this year with substantially higher R&D investment. We've had a lot of conversation about acquisitions on this call and seems like you guys have made some really good ones to set you up for future growth. But on that R&D side, I just wanted to get your sense of kind of at this point in the year where you feel you are relative to the leverage you're getting on that R&D and the innovation that you're getting from it? And how you might feel relative to whether that's sort of a new steady state? And how we might think about R&D spend going forward? Thank you.
H. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, Rob, I think where we are with R&D right now is, as we've noted before, we've got a lot of projects going on. They're spanning the entire portfolio of our products. We're pleased with where that development is. As you know, it takes time. Once we start that development, it takes time to get the products out, get them into RFPs, get them showing. So we're pleased with the progress of where they are today and what we think they'll drive down the road. As we look out going farther, as you know, we have done some acquisitions. Typically what we do with acquisitions is we bring them in and we actually invest in them. We've got a pretty good history of that. We talked earlier about some deals in the comments about ExecuTime. That's an acquisition we bought a couple years ago. We took a very deliberate approach to investing in it. And here we are a couple years later, and it's starting to really contribute. We've made some significant acquisitions this year, obviously Socrata. We're not – we're just now beginning the planning phase for 2019, but when we make an acquisition like Socrata, and we think where there's leverage across our base, it's likely we'll be making some significant investments there. But the amount and the timing of those we haven't worked out yet.
Brian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: And I wouldn't expect that R&D expense, the gross expense goes backwards next year. But we do believe that as you look out over an extended period of time, over the next several years that we do see leverage over the long term in R&D as we're able to invest – leverage investments across multiple products and ultimately be more efficient about that. So in the near term we're opportunistic, as we are with M&A, on R&D and those two play together as well depending on as we make various build versus buy decisions and how we allocate the capital between R&D and M&A.
Rob Oliver - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you, guys.
Operator: The next question comes from Patrick Walravens with JMP. Please go ahead.
Peter Lowry - JMP Securities LLC: Hi. It's Pete Lowry in for Pat. Can you talk a bit about whether your go-to-market or sales motion is different as you sell suite solutions like Courts & Justice?
John S. Marr - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: It's more of a coordination. We're kind of working through that, but we will continue to maintain separate sales channels. There is a high level of expertise, domain knowledge and relationships that exist in the different channels. So, again, the skillset, the relationships that somebody on the justice side of the business has is going to be very different than somebody selling an enterprise financial system or tax and appraisal solution. So we will keep – I think we've consolidated the channels to the extent we will – we look at it, hey, if you've built this organically from scratch, what would you have? And I don't think you'd have a single sales rep selling a court solution, as well as a tax solution. You'd draw the lines pretty much to where we've evolved. So at this point what's critical is to have sales executives that take the lead. So that while we have several different people with domain expertise in the different areas that are going to talk the language and understand the needs of the different areas of the solution that we certainly appear as a cohesive comprehensive sales channel when we're representing multi-suite solutions. And that's really where the evolution and the changes take place now. So I don't see the channels changing much. I think that the coordination of those and establishing leads that are able to present the solution, negotiate a contract, deliver services in a comprehensive way is where we are in the evolution at this point in time.
Peter Lowry - JMP Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks. One quick follow-up. How should we think about Q4 cash flows? Did some of the outperformance in Q3 pull from Q4 or would that be within normal sequential pattern?
Brian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: I think the sequential pattern would be pretty normal. Q3 is always our biggest quarter, it was a little bit better than I think we would've expected. So I don't think our outlook for the – so some of that may have been, sometime in Q3 versus Q4, but Q4 is also a relatively strong period for cash flows. So I don't think our view for the full year has really changed from what we were seeing prior to this quarter.
Peter Lowry - JMP Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Tim Klasell with Northland Securities. Please go ahead.
Tim Klasell - Northland Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. I wanted to sort of jump a little bit into the comments you made around more complex and potentially longer, harder-to-predict sales cycles. In particular, I did a little bit of digging with the Lubbock, Texas, and that seems to be sort of a great example of what you can do with some cross-selling. But, can you walk us through the longer sales cycles, what that means on the calendar of what you saw before and after and I'm sure you're selling to more departments inside of the government, so it takes longer, but wondering if you can give us some maybe a little bit of color around how much longer it's taking?
John S. Marr - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: So actually, I think what we need to do is clarify what we said. I don't think we're really seeing a longer sales cycle. So for our core traditional products, I don't think anything's really changed there in terms of the sales process or the cycle. What we're referring to is, it's taking longer for the market to adopt these newer initiatives that we have; Modria, re:Search, redaction these sorts of things. So it's not the traditional sales cycle that we've seen lengthening, it's just these new products that are being embraced by the marketplace and from the value proposition all those things are encouraging, but it's taking a little longer for those adoption rates to go up and to see the revenues come online. So it's really more aligned with the growth initiatives rather than the traditional sales cycle.
Tim Klasell - Northland Securities, Inc.: Okay, okay. And then just a quick follow-on. A lot of your contracts I believe we have some sort of inflationary clause in there when the contracts renew or maybe on an annual basis. Can you walk us through what those are generally geared to? Are they to the CPI? You have a fixed rate. Or if we do enter into a high inflationary environment, how are those contracts protected roughly speaking?
John S. Marr - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Some of them are CPIs, some of them are just a flat percentage and some of them, the initial engagement is flat for the term of the initial engagement. So it's a competitive marketplace and we negotiate what we can. That's probably the driving reason for what Brian referred to which is a conscious shortening of these initial cycles. So originally as some of the SaaS solutions were newer and even originally we used to kind of capitalize into the relationship the service component. And the markets kind of matured and settled into paying services for the initial deployment and just having the subscription fee before say hosting and product licensing and maintenance. So that's – those things evolving. The shorter cycle with hardly any attrition at all doesn't give anything up for us and it gets us to a point where we can just let the market determine the increases. And as you're indicating not have the inflationary exposure. The three years we're down to what? 3.5 years, 3.4 years or something that's a pretty short period of time and after that for most of these they just go to whatever the appropriate market rate is. So the exposure I think is becoming more and more limited.
Brian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: And, Tim, even in a deal where there's a three-year agreement, for example, that has a flat fee for that initial term, the economics of the deal would still have the annual increases built into those, but the payment is just an average payment. So even though optically it may look like there's no growth from those revenues over three years, the economics still have built in increases in it. But we do want to, as John said, limit the long-term exposure to fixed contracts and give us the flexibility with pricing and cost change.
John S. Marr - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: You need to look at the whole customer base too. I think you said you have annualized recurring revenue rates are what, somewhere in the mid-$600 million now. Certainly a high percentage of that, a lot of these thousands of clients have been acquired over many, many years, so the vast majority of that number are people that are on annual contracts. We certainly aren't looking to increase them at any unusual rate, but should there be inflation exposure, there aren't any limitations at all. It's only those contracts from the last few years that are in there and again that's relatively a small percent.
Brian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: And virtually all of our maintenance agreements are annual agreements. It's rare that we have multi-year maintenance agreements.
Tim Klasell - Northland Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you very much for the color.
Operator: The next question comes from Mark Schappel with Benchmark. Please go ahead.
Mark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Just one question, John, on international expansion, it was touched on in your prepared remarks as part of the growth strategy. I was wondering if you could just remind us real quickly here where the company is at with respect to your expansion efforts overseas?
John S. Marr - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. It's predominantly right now Courts & Justice. So those solutions – and it's predominantly English-speaking places, so some in Europe and, obviously, the first deployments have been in Australia. So that continues to kind of be the case. We have a – something's going on in South America, but for the most part it's English-speaking Courts & Justice solutions.
Mark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: At this time, there appears to be no more questions. Mr. Marr, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.
John S. Marr - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Appreciate you all joining us on the earnings call today. If there are any further questions, feel free to reach out to Brian, Lynn or myself. Again, thanks for joining us and have a great day.
Operator: This conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Lynn?
Lynn Moore: Thank you, Brian. Our second quarter results were strong in terms of revenues earnings and cash flows. Total GAAP revenues grew just over 13% and non-GAAP revenues grew almost 14%, of which 12% was organic and 2% was contributed by the Socrata and Sage acquisitions. Both software licensing subscription revenues were particularly solid in the quarter. Software licenses and royalties were $22 million, up 16% and subscription revenues grew 31% to $53 million. Total recurring revenues from maintenance and subscriptions grew 15% and comprised 63% of total revenue. From a new contract mix perspective, the number of subscription arrangements in our new business mix was once again greater than traditional license deals. However, the total contract value added for new license arrangements was higher than the value of SaaS deals. Bookings this quarter were solid at $262 million. We had somewhat difficult comparison of a record bookings in the second quarter of last year, which included the $35 million Cook County, Odyssey deal. As such, bookings were down 8%. However, bookings grew 34% sequentially over the first quarter of 2018. It was a particularly successful quarter for new business for our Public Safety division. Our largest new license deals for the quarter or contract with Summit County, Ohio for our New World Public Safety and Brazos Solutions and one with San Bernardino County, California for Eagle Recorder Solution each valued at approximately $3.3 million. Summit County selected our Enterprise CAD, Enterprise Record Management System, mobile and other solutions to manage the complex consolidation of 14 law enforcement agencies, 12 fire departments and six public safety entering points in the county. This is the largest New World Public Safety contract signed this decade. Other significant on-premises public safety deals signed during the quarter, each with a total contract valued at $1 million or more including contracts with the Wyoming Highway Petrol for the full suite of our New World Public Safety and Brazos Solutions and Elk County Pennsylvania for our New World Public Safety Solution. Significant license contracts for our newest ERP solution included the city of Irving, Texas which is the 12th largest city in the state and among the 100 largest cities in the nation, as well as the Emerald Coast Utilities Authority, the largest water, wastewater and sanitation service utility in Northwest Florida. Significant new SaaS contracts in the quarter included multi-suite deals for our newest [ph] solutions with Walton County and the City of Weston both located in Florida, as well as Glenwood Springs, Colorado; Ontario County, New York and Glynn County, Georgia for our newest ERP solution; the cities of Atlanta, Georgia and Coire Gabhail, Florida for our EnerGov solution and the Choctaw Nation in Oklahoma for our Odyssey Courts & Justice solution. Our Courts & Justice division also added the State of New Mexico as its third client for research as a complement to the existing e-filing arrangements. We were also very pleased with bookings for Socrata, which had its best bookings quarter in two years. Socrata’s SaaS bookings came in well ahead of plan, reflecting that clients are adopting the new Socrata Connected Government Cloud and are signing longer contracts. Notable new Socrata clients include the State of Texas Department of Information Resources and Pinellas County, Florida, each of which signed five-year contracts. And the California Office of Emergency Services. Now I’d Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and update our annual guidance for 2018.
Brian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. Yesterday Tyler Technologies reported its results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2018. I’m going to provide some additional data on the quarter’s performance and update our annual guidance for 2018 and then John will have some additional comments. In the earnings release we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. These measures include -- exclude write-downs of acquisition-related deferred revenue and acquired leases, share-based compensation expense, employer portion of payroll taxes and employee stock transactions and amortization of acquired intangibles. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We’ve also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financials & Annual Report tab schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. GAAP revenues for the quarter were $236.1 million, up 13.1%. Organic GAAP revenue growth was 11.2%. On a non-GAAP basis, revenues were $237.7 million, up 13.7% with 11.8% organic growth. Subscription revenues for the quarter increased 30.8%. We added 126 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 32 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $31.5 million in total contract value. In Q2 of last we added 105 new subscription-based arrangements and have 37 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $49.8 million in total contract value. Subscription clients represented approximately 58% of the number of new software contracts in the quarter compared to 51% in the prior quarter, while subscription contract value comprised 47% of the total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 39% in Q2 last year. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 4.2 years compared to 5.2 years in Q2 of last year. Transaction-based revenues from the e-filing and online payments which are included in subscriptions increased 19.5% to $16.7 million from $14 million last year. That amount includes e-filing revenue of $12.7 million, up 20.1% over last year. Annualized total non-GAAP recurring revenues for Q2 were approximately $603 million, up 16.3%. Cash flow from operations was $22.6 million compared to $1.4 million last year. Free cash flow, which is calculated as cash from operations less capital expenditures was $16.5 million compared to a negative $8.9 million for the same period last year. Capital expenditures declined 41% due to the completion of our Yarmouth office expansion. Our CapEx for the quarter was $6.1 million including approximately $690,000 related to real estate compared to total CapEx of $10.3 million in Q2 of last year, which included $4.7 million related to real estate. We ended the quarter with a $192.4 million in cash and investments and no outstanding debt. Day sales outstanding and accounts receivable was 114 days at June 30, 2018 compared to 108 days at June 30, 2017. Excluding unbilled receivables, DSOs were 89 days at both quarter ends, which was unchanged from last year. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $1.2 billion, up 10.9%. Backlog included $356 million of maintenance compared to $332 million a year ago. Subscription backlog was $480 million compared to $395 million last year and includes approximately $131 million related to fixed-fee e-filing contracts. Our bookings for the quarter, which are calculated from the change in backlog plus non-GAAP revenues were approximately $2602 million. A decrease of 8.3% as Q2 of last year included the $35 million Cook County Odyssey contract. For the trailing 12 months bookings were approximately $1 billion. Our software subscription bookings in the quarter added $6.6 million in new annual recurring revenue down 14% from $7.6 million last year. Q2 of last year included three large subscription deals, each with a contract value of over $5 million. For comparison, if all of our new subscription contracts had been under license arrangements, we estimate that they would have represented additional license bookings of approximately $9.2 million. We signed 25 new contracts in the quarter that included software licenses greater than $100,000 and those contracts at an average license of $459,000 compared to 25 new contracts with an average license value of $842,000 in the second quarter of 2017, which included the $35 million contract with Cook County. Our guidance for the full year 2018 is as follows, we expect 2018 GAAP revenues will be between $934 million and $948 million and non-GAAP revenues will be between $940 million in $954 million. We expect the 2018 GAAP diluted EPS will be between $3.50 and $3.58 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock option exercises on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect 2018 non-GAAP dividend EPS will be between $4.76 and $4.84. For the year estimated pre-tax non-cash share-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $54 million. We expect R&D expense for the year will be between $62 million and $64 million. Fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between $40 million and $40.5 million shares. GAAP earnings per share assumes an estimated annual effective tax rate of 10% after discrete text items and it includes approximately $26 million of discrete tax benefits related to share based compensation, which may vary significantly based on the timing and volume of stock option exercises. Our estimated non-GAAP effective annual tax rate for 2018 is 24%. This rate was reduced from 35% for 2017 to reflect enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Actually. We expect our total capital expenditures will be between $23 million and $26 million for the year. Total depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $62 million, including approximately $40 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to John for his further comments.
John Marr: Thanks, Brian. Our second quarter results again met or exceeded our expectations by most measures. We again achieved solid double-digit revenue growth, even in subscriptions made up a higher percentage of new software contracts. And this was our 27th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. We're pleased that we've been able to grow earnings significantly while we're funded major incremental, R&D initiatives and absorbed in acquisition that is dilutive in the short-term. As we previously discussed, we significantly increased our R&D spend over the last two years with the number of projects across the company. We continue to be pleased with the progress on these initiatives and while there is near-term pressure on margins from the higher spend, we're confident that these investments are smart, and we'll produce solid returns and further strengthen our competitive position. We believe the investments we're making in our New World Public Safety solutions are starting to affect decisions in the marketplace. And we're factor in new business this quarter. Including meaningful wins in Summit County, Ohio, in the Wyoming highway patrol In Q2, we also launched our Tyler EAM product. This enterprise asset maintenance solution provides a complete view of an organization's assets from procurement to maintenance to retirement, as well as citizen engagement and represents a major R&D effort to expand our product offering. As we approach the 90-day mark since the acquisition of Socrata and Sage on April 30th. We remain enthusiastic about these most recent additions and continue to be impressed with the talent and passion of their teams that now part of Tyler. Integration of their operations as well as their products and services is well underway and the results in Q2 met or exceeded our expectations. Just a few weeks ago, Tyler announced the launch of Socrata Connected Government Cloud, a revolutionary approach to internal data sharing. This solution will empower government workers to access a single source of data and securely share analysis, visualizations and performance measures across multiple departments and programs. Considering our year-to-date performance together with our current positive outlook for the second half of the year we revised upward our full year earnings guidance. We’re pleased that our outlook has strengthened even after considering the dilutive impact of our second quarter acquisitions. Steven, we’ll take questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Peter Heckmann with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.
Peter Heckmann: Good morning everyone thanks for taking my questions. Brian on e-filing we kind of seen the revenue plateau there in the last few quarters can you remind us about the go live schedule where you’re going to see some relatively larger projects go live here before year end?
Brian Miller: Yeah, we talked broadly over the next couple of years that we expect e-filing revenues to move from so the current $50 million level to the $75 million annual wise range and that takes place over as I said over the course of next couple of years. There are some go live schedule throughout the remainder of this year and onto next year particularly in some of the California counties where we’ve been doing implementations of the underlying Cage Management Systems in those e-filing implementations follow that. I don't really have the specifics of exactly how those falls of the timing become somewhat fluid in the short-term, but again over the next couple of years we expect e-filing revenues to grow by approximately 50% from where they are today.
Peter Heckmann: Okay, that’s helpful. And then as a follow-up, just the non-subscription backlog, if my math is right was up about 4% year-over-year I would have thought maybe the growth have been a little bit higher given the mix, but as the mix continues to move towards that subscription, how do you feel like if affects kind of your organic growth rate over the next four to six quarters?
Lynn Moore: Well, in the short term, an increased mix of subscriptions obviously puts pressure on organic growth because we don’t get the upfront license revenue recognition. So, that does gives us a little bit of headwind there. We do expect that overtime that subscriptions were increase as a percentage of our revenue mix, but as you see in the past they can be very lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. So, we’re pleased that we continue to grow both sides of the business both the license and the subscription side and we’re happy to acquire new customers whichever way they want to come to us and we certainly manage the ups and downs in the short-term organic growth as we continue to build that overall backlog.
Peter Heckmann: Okay, thanks. I’ll get back in the queue.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Alex Zukin: Yeah hey thanks guys for taking just a couple of questions here and congrats on another solid quarter. so, I want to start maybe on Socrata I guess I wanted to ask given the strength of the bookings I think Lynn you mentioned strongest bookings in two years. how much of that is due to the product being kind of brought to the broader Tyler salesforce versus just the Socrata salesforce and how should we think about the opportunity to potentially significantly accelerate the books of growth of that business as well as leverage Socrata to actually improve some of the sales cycles on other product lines given kind of some of the higher level selling that happens with that product?
Lynn Moore: Yeah, sure Alex, I think the high bookings is a function as much of the strategic pivot that they did a couple of years ago and really the release of the Socrata Connected Government Cloud that pivot, they -- originally Socrata was more of an open data company. The pivot to move and internal data sharing, the release of that. Certainly, joining Tyler brought some enthusiasm, I think brought some stability. And so, I think that was helpful, but these were deals that were likely somewhat in the queue ahead of time, I don’t know that we had a major impact on them other than like I said bringing the stability, the Tyler name and the vision for what they had already created and what we’re going to do together. You’re right on integration with Tyler products. It’s something we’re focused on right now. In the near-term, we’re really focused on probably some of the what I would call more low-hanging fruits, some of the connectors to our products. In July, we released a product called Open Finance, which was in conjunction with Munis and that’s already been well received. I’d expect a few more of those products to come out probably in the next quarter.
Brian Miller: But Alex, in Q2 there were really no Socrata sales through the Tyler channel.
Alex Zukin: Got it. That’s helpful. And then maybe on New World, another I guess product where you had a particularly strong quarter with that extremely large deal. Can you speak to maybe what’s driving that success, how does the pipeline look given that this is a 4Q weighted business and maybe talk about your confidence in that pipeline and those deals and how it’s changed maybe over the last quarter?
Lynn Moore: Yeah, sure Alex. We had -- some accounting was the largest deal as I mentioned earlier, largest deal in certainly, probably last 10 years for New World Public Safety. I think it’s really response to our investments and all the work that we’ve been doing in the last 2.5 years since we’ve acquired them. We’ve made significant investments in their CAD, in their RMS, Mobility just got released this year. All of those were key in some accounting deal, as well as the Wyoming Highway Patrol deal that I mentioned earlier. Those were big license deals, some accounting was about a $2 million license, Wyoming Highway was about a $750,000 license. So, I think it’s just the reception to what we’ve been doing and what we -- what I think we do really well which is develop our own products, get out there and we’re doing a really good job selling. The pipeline for the rest of the year looks good. You are correct, there is -- it tends to be more heavily weighted in Q4. There is a number of deals that we’re chasing that we’re going to have to close and it’s always a little bit of herding cats at the end of the year, but we like what we see in the pipeline for New World Public Safety.
Alex Zukin: Got it. And then if I could just squeeze one more. With SaaS becoming a greater proportion of the mix, you guys have made changes on contract durations for new customers. Can you talk about maybe a, why you’ve made those changes, what does that do for you guys in terms of being able to maybe increase some of the price points earlier in the contracts and what impact that’s going to have on bookings? Thanks.
Lynn Moore: Yeah. Over the last year or so, we have changed sort of our standard terms for new SaaS deals, generally those are now initial three-year contracts. In the past five years it was more of the standard and sometime back seven years was we even frequently had. We prefer to have a little bit shorter initial term contracts to give us flexibility with pricing down the road to respond to potential changes in costs and changes in the customers’ operations. And you see that in this quarter where the average term of a new SaaS deal moved down from I think 5.2 years last year to 4.2 years, this year. So, that does have some optical effect on total bookings in backlog because you’ve got a smaller initial total agreement coming into the backlog. But because we continue to see very, very high customer attention, the same or if not higher in our SaaS customers is our on-prem customers, we don’t believe we need to push for very long initial terms but prefer to keep those three-year standards on new deals.
Alex Zukin: Great. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Ho with William Blair & Company. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Ho: Hi, good morning. And let me echo the congratulations as well. Just wanted to maybe start out with -- and maybe some of the investments that you’re making, can you give us an update of sort of where we are in terms of that and how much of that is maybe contributing to the strong organic growth so far?
Lynn Moore: Well, these are kind of ongoing projects, they don’t necessarily have beginnings and ends. Some of them are new products, but most of them are incremental investments or I guess elevated investments in some of our core products. So, even something like an EAM that we spoke of, obviously is a new product that the teams created, but the team will largely stay in place and we'll continue to invest in the technology and the functionality of that application going forward. The early release is kind of probably the first three releases will take that to independently competitive position. Elevated investments and things like GAO, and New World Public Safety research are kind of significant projects that are at a high level and maybe back off at some point in the future. But there is a lot of just small incremental investments and things like executive time and the core products, technology and functionality certainly Sage and Socrata will have incremental investments in their integration and into our broader systems. So, basically, we look at it as having added a lot of heads to different products that we felt could be impactful to our competitive position and catalyst of future growth and we’re starting to see that. We had even marginal bends upward in our growth rate are encouraging to us and we feel are sustainable and that we can grow on those incrementally. But, you won’t see a reduction in these heads, these are not a temporary thing. This is really probably pulling forwards heads from two or three years out into the current spend to take advantage of those opportunities in the marketplace and we'll go into them and then we will see our R&D grow at a lower rate than our overall spend and kind of grow back into it is the way I'd encourage you to think about it.
Jonathan Ho: Got it. That’s helpful. And then, just from a win rate perspective, you've anecdotally talked about New World improving here, but is there anything that you can quantify for us in terms of how that win rate may be picks up from here or hasn’t evidenced in the most recent set of wins.
Lynn Moore: Win rates, it improves quickly as you know and probably quicker than we could have expected, and our real focus was on, this is sustainable, and it has been - so their win rates are pretty good. They can pick up further, But, I think the broader growth for them, they had a leadership position. I don't know I am not sure it's a narrow segment of the marketplace, but certainly not, the entire marketplace or as a significant size. So, geographically and more importantly the size of the clients is, broadening that addressable markets base and applying what is now a good win rate against a broader marketplace. I think we will see the growth over the coming few years.
Jonathan Ho: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Berg with Needham & Co. Please go ahead.
Scott Berg: Hi, everyone, Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, I have two, they both can generically around Socrata, when this is probably for yourselves since you made the comments. Best bookings in the quarter, just wanted to if you can help us impact that a little bit, was it ASP driven, just large area ASP, may be a number of deals relative to what they've seen recently or your certain types of products or GAO, just want to try to maybe understand what that best quarter kind of looks like for them?
Lynn Moore: Yes, sure. I think it's a little bit of both. I don’t think it was targeted in a one specific geographic area. It was also a combination of a couple of the deals signing out for a longer time. I think I have mentioned that there were some couple of five-year terms involved. It's really a function of the work they have been putting in the last couple of years into this Socrata -- it’s across the board, it was both number of deals, size of deals, term of deals, nothing one think specifics, Scott.
Scott Berg: Got it. Helpful. And then question for you Brian on the impact of Socrata in the quarter, I can do the math on the revenue side, that’s pretty easy and obviously only acquisition of the quarter. But, can you help us to understand maybe from a bookings perspective, what was organic versus inorganic in that number.
Brian Miller: Yes. Bookings were in the $7.5 million range from Socrata. So, that would be the inorganic part. I’m sorry 5.7.
Scott Berg: Thanks, Lynn. Helpful. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Kirk Materne: Yes, good morning everyone. Congrats on the quarter. I guess my question, I was actually just curious around some of the contracts that you guys have been selling on a subscription basis. Is there any commonality just around why people are moving in that direction, whether it’s the size of the constituency, whether either some regions that are more comfortable or sort of moving to a subscription model. I was just kind of curious, I am guessing it more idiosyncratic than that on a customer-by-customer basis. But just curious if you are seeing a trend on that front.
Lynn Moore: I think it’s just government market, local government markets slower to embrace these changes. So, for years we were – our migration was slower than the commercial market you might fall. The comfort level with this is growing, the awareness of it has grown and they are just embracing. The question earlier on the impact on growth really it’s been if we could design the migration by from a timing standpoint this has been a really good one, right we had pretty good reception 10 years ago, 12 years ago when we launch this, it's slowly and incrementally build therefore the cannibalization of licenses in the profitable business model we have has been slow enough to not overly impact that and seeing this continue to slow grow is really work well for our model and that’s what we see going forward. Geographic or even across products, I don’t think there is anything – it’s pretty consistent. I think in recent quarters maybe over the last year we have reported that we have seen more larger contracts in this area, early on it was more of a mid-range kind of play and we have seen more of the large clients move to a SaaS model, so that seems to be if there is any change it’s on the high end.
Kirk Materne: Okay and...
Brian Miller: Just add to that. I think the other thing is in the increased bookings and subscription model is that we have added more pure SaaS solutions like Socrata and in the Courts and Justice area, Modria and research and e-file of those growth – the growth of those offerings has also been high and that’s helped caused that mix to go up.
Kirk Materne: Okay. And you guys obviously noted that your win rates are up in the public safety area. I was just interested when you look at the pipeline at the RFP so do you see coming is there any real change in the broader market, I guess from your view John, Lynn. Just in terms of what you would have expected, I am just wondering whether or not the broader sort of economic lift we are seeing is sort of helping or encouraging some of your customers to make faster decisions or decision maybe they are waiting on for a year from now? Thanks.
John Marr: I don’t think – we have talked in the past that the 08, 09 economic issues were deep enough to affect us, but it’s rare, I don’t know that economic issues we could say are – to much of what’s going on with us. The market is good, it’s a little lumpy right now a couple segments were a little late on RFPs and in that kind of leading indicators, but others were very strong and so across the board it's pretty good and our general outlook is positive there was some lumpiness on the internal numbers inside, but again generally, it’s pretty strong, but probably not impacted by economic issues at this point.
Kirk Materne: Okay, great. That’s it for me. Thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tim Klasell, with Northland Securities. Please go ahead.
Tim Klasell: Yes, hi. My questions are around the Socrata acquisition. First, the large deal you mentioned. Is that common in the pipeline, or is that sort of look forward - should we expect to see more of those or is that a little bit of an abnormality if you will? Thank you.
Lynn Moore: Yes, Tim, I think Socrata historically has been focused on what they call the go 500 which is the sort of the larger tier local governments and state and fed. I think you’re going to continue to see some of that, I think some of what Tyler brings is our client base, so you’re going to see a little bit more mix as we push this out throughout our client base, but I think you’re going to continue to see a good mix of that, this quarter not only did they have the Texas DIR which I mentioned the City of California emergency services, they also did a smaller dealer with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. They are playing in all kinds of different markets, and we're excited about are the markets that we're going to bring to them.
Tim Klasell: Okay, good. And then on Socrata, has their win rates picked up, and is this giving you as part of Tyler. Is this giving you comfort around maybe doing more of these - I'm going to call for Tyler that the non-traditional acquisition of more of a technology and paying the bill, but higher multiple for a younger company. has it gives you more confidence that maybe this should be in your acquisition quiver if you will or in your acquisition pipeline. Thank you.
Lynn Moore: Yeah, I guess I would say, we're going to continue to be focused on the things that we do well. What we really liked about Socrata was the complementary nature to Tyler's business. As you say, a little bit out of our wheelhouse, but at the same time really a glove and hand compliment. The vision that we have and where we're taking the company towards the connected communities vision is something that Socrata fit just perfectly with. We look at acquisitions regularly, we look at all types of acquisitions. I don't know that I would expect us to do something significantly outside of our current wheelhouse. And again, I would consider Socrata a little bit different. It really it was a good complement and part of our overall strategic growth.
Tim Klasell: Okay good. And did the win rate, did that get affected or have you noticed any change with the Socrata being part of the Tyler family?
Lynn Moore: Socrata, their products not really sold through RFP. They do a good job selling, that's what we're going to do. We've only had them 60-90 days now. What we expect to do is we expect to be able to push this through our customer base and then they're going to continue with their sales force and continue to do things that they have been doing. So, I'm not sure win rates are as appropriate as more as just there is just going to be continuing to add on sales.
Tim Klasell: Good enough. Thank you very much for that insight. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Oliver with Baird. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks. This is Matt [ph] on for Rob this morning. I had one follow up on Alex Zukin's question earlier on New World Public Safety, the nice deal wins sited in the prepared remarks Summit County Ohio and Wyoming. Were those deals competitive, and maybe who you ultimately went up and won against there?
Lynn Moore: Yeah, sure. Both of those deals were highly competitive. Summit County had been out for a long time, it's a deal we have been chasing, certainly a larger deal as I mentioned earlier, large contracts that ever signed. I think to John's comments, it's an example of them also expanding their addressable market. TriTech was involved in the Wyoming deal that we won recently. Off the top of my head I'm not sure who the players were in the Summit County, but it was very competitive.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, that's helpful. And then on Socrata, it sounds like the contract links are increasing there the one in the state of Texas CRR. I think you said contract length of five years. I don't know if we've heard this, what is the average contract length for a typical Socrata deal more of the average not the longer one.
Lynn Moore: I think generally, their portfolio is made up of one-year contracts. I think it's still little bit early, we're actually encouraged by some people winning longer-term. I think it helps proved the stability of the product and what it can do strategically for our clients. But typically, they're one-year contracts.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brent Bracelin with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Brent Bracelin: Thank you for taking the question here. I wanted to do one more question on Socrata and that was specifically given you said that there were no Socrata deals or sales through the -- channel win. Do you expect Socrata to be sold more broadly through this type of channel? And maybe just touch on the sales cycle. Is it different than your sales cycle.
Lynn Moore: Sure Brent. I'd expect Tyler sales to start occurring this quarter like I mentioned earlier. We've released a product called Open Finance, which was in conjunction with Socrata and that released July 1. We're currently working on those integration plans, we're both on a product standpoint and a sales standpoint. It's going to take a little work internally. But I believe those sales will start coming in this quarter and certainly in Q4 and continue to build as we get into next year.
Brent Bracelin: In the sale cycle of Socrata is it different than your other products?
John Marr: Yeah, it's a big segment here so I think their high end direct sales some of those maybe longer, it’s a newer product, it’s a newer concept, it’s typically not something that replacing are done, it’s a new initiative, so they could be longer, but I think as we go into and move into the traditional Tyler clients, a lot of that will be true, our insight sales channel and into our existing customer base and I think those will generally be non-competitive, non-RFP deals that will go through our insight sales channel and I would think that'd be shorter processes. And the same is true for Sage that these will differentiate us and help us in the new business, new name market, but I think the volume over the next two or three years will be into our install base and they’ll tend to be to a relationship that it exists in a non-competitive, non-RFP process.
Brent Bracelin: Very helpful. My last question is really around the industry. I know you touched on it a little bit, but just personally property tax is certainly paying a lot more today than that was one, two, three years ago. You know how the Supreme Court ruling, where Nexus changes and so you now are going to see online sales taxes, all of that should help the budgets of local government. So, walk me through just how you look of the health of the budgets of local government and is the appetite to modernize higher now than it was in the last one or two years or not, it’s just - this is just a slow-moving kind of market any color there would be helpful.
John Marr: To be fair, we can't have it both ways. So, we’ve always said, we are not very economically sensitive in our market place. I mentioned earlier the 08-09 issue was deep enough that it did affect us. I really think that’s the only time in the last 30 years that something got to that point where there was a meaningful impact on our marketplace. So, right now we’re in kind of modest wins in the marketplace and as we said everything we do is essential, everything has to be done. There is an appetite to do it well in the used technology to enhance productivity and cost and we benefit from that but it’s the healthy market, it’s better when the economy is good but it’s not a big dramatic shift really in that demand. We expect it to be steady. Everything we do again is essential and there is a lot of older systems that need to be replaced and they’ll be replaced really regardless of the economic conditions. When the economy is good obviously they can move those forward or at least do them on time and really what we saw in 08-09 was that weakness pushed some things out but still occurred so if you look back at us historically we had a flat year at that time a couple of lower growth years and then we had some higher than trend level years as the catch up occurred. Property values are a primary funder of local government and therefore our solutions in most cases, there are some obviously distressed cities and counties around the country, but in most cases almost every year there are more parcels than there were in the previous year, and in most cases, the values over the long-term continue to go up, so your taxes due and their budgets due and their ability to afford our systems benefits from that. Sales taxes generally in cities sometimes large cities, sometimes we have sales tax, but generally sales tax are a state revenue thing and then so as we've said, we can’t have both ways but our revenues that directly fund local government property tax as utilities , fees, fines, these sorts of things tend to be very steady and not as influenced by economic swings, state being income in sales and federal being predominantly income, those are the things that obviously swing and have greater variances based on economic conditions. Local government does get revenue sharing generally one of the last things that’s touched because it goes to education and sewer and public safety and things that are not politically nobody wants to touch politically, so generally they are one of the last things to get touched but the direct revenues are a property tax as utilities and those things that we all pay regardless of what kind of year we had.
Brent Bracelin: Very clear. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Matthew Spencer [ph] on for Pat. Thank you for taking our question. Just big picture, what’s the biggest challenge facing the IT departments of state and local governments today?
John Marr: Probably transition of resources, a lot of brain drain going on that -- probably the biggest impact of that on us of what we call a flip, so conversions from on premise to SaaS. So, there's a lot of resources that are reaching retirement. And as they move out, it's a catalyst for people to say, hey, we don't have the experts that we've relied on all these years, employment market is difficult, limited and the compensation they can provide for what is really a broad set of skills. And so that would be maybe the biggest thing. Obviously, security is a big deal for everybody right now. And if you just Google it, and you can see, a lot of different hacks, number of ransom situations. And I think our timing on Sage is really, really good. And again, through our installed sales channel, where we have an established relationship, we're trusted partner, we think that's a need that we can help serve for our clients and will further enhance the stickiness of our relationship with our clients.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Schappel with Benchmark. Please go ahead.
Mark Schappel: Hi, thank you for taking my question. I do have a question on Modria, the solution was initially thought to be a potential 2019 revenue event and I was -- John, I was just wanting based on your early experience with the product in Nevada, whether you believe we'll be hearing a lot more of that solution with respect to new deals around that time frame?
John Marr: Around what time frame sorry?
Mark Schappel: 2019?
John Marr: Yes. No, I think the direct channel and what they would have been doing on their own, which will continue as strong as Lynn said, we're not a direct impact on that those are the resources that have been there and will continue to be there. The evolution of the product and what's been released recently are things that obviously we're underway, I think they were small venture back company, that some uncertainty around that and the Tyler brand and presence in the marketplace, along with that financial stability enhances that, and I think we'll continue to see them do well there and probably do better than they would have with the benefit of those things. The real incremental revenue will come as we start to drive that through our install channel and into our customer base, which as Lynn said, is beginning at this point in time, we'll start slowly and build from there. So certainly, we hope and expect that 2019 would see higher revenues and we'll watch the run rates, it's all occurring, it's all SaaS. And I think you'll see those recurring revenue run rate certainly grow in 2017 and beyond.
Mark Schappel: Okay.
Lynn Moore: And Mark as it as it relates to Modria. There is a lot of excitement in the market about that. I kind of view similar to e-filing in that, in the sense that e-filing was something that came along and started fundamentally transforming the way courts operate. And I think Modria has that potential down the road. But you mentioned Clark County, that's one of our greatest partners with C&J, they are initially filing client. They did just finish a pilot project out there in three courts. It was a parenting plan contract and parenting plan courts where they that's really divorces children. And by all accounts at 8 was very well received, we had certain out or over 50% of litigants use the Modria solution and the numbers are used the Modria solution for a full outcome was high for approximately almost half. The other ones that used it to certainly will down the issues to where a quarter, a mediator only had to decide on a few issues that was also high approaching that same number. So, the excitement still seems to be there. But it is a change in the way course to business. So, it will probably start slow, but momentum is starting to build, and I would expect to see continued revenue growth at a Modria in 2019.
Mark Schappel: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Liu with B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead.
Kevin Liu: Hi. Good morning. I was just wondering how much of a revenue uplift do you expect from your New Mexico e-file business with the adoption of research. And could you talk about what sort of interest levels you're seeing from your existing e-file customers for that product?
Brian Miller: Yeah. Research is in New Mexico about $250,000 a year initial contract. We have -- as I mentioned, that’s our third state to adopt Research behind Illinois and Texas. We have active discussions with a number of other states and counties throughout the country that use our e-filing solutions and our Odyssey customers. And we do expect to see additional adoption of that over the coming year. Those contracts really are the fee that the state is paying us, or the courts are paying us for their research capability. We have additional opportunities from adding value-added services that we contract directly with the attorneys for that are on top of those amounts, there would be more transaction or subscription-based numbers. Those are in the early stages of getting into place. And because those are also sort of new offerings that haven’t existed in the market before, it’s a little hard to predict exactly what those are. But we expect over the next couple of quarters to start to see some history on the added, value-added attorney services and start to see how that revenue stream would build as well.
Kevin Liu: Got it. And just one quick question on the margin side of things. Your services and recurring gross margin expanded nicely from the first quarter. Should we think about this as kind of more gradual expansion overtime or is it similar to kind of your R&D investment where there is a fair amount of investment going on right now given the opportunity you see in the market?
Brian Miller: I expect that to be an overtime thing. Margins in the long run will continue. We believe we have significant margin expansion opportunity. And the subscription side of the business, particularly as it grows, and we get passed the initial implementations and get into the out years with these incremental subscription customers, they become more and more profitable. So, we do expect over the long run to see expansion in margins in the short-term obviously impacted by the increased investment in R&D and the lumpiness of license revenues.
Kevin Liu: Okay. Thanks for taking the questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Charlie Strauzer with CJS Securities. Please go ahead.
Charlie Strauzer: Hi, good morning. Just one quick question 0:03:01.3 on the SaaS subscription comments that you guys have had. If you look at the kind of the RFPs that are coming out today versus maybe five years ago, are you seeing a much greater amount of kind of requirement for SaaS-based offering or cloud-based offering going forward on these RFPs?
John Marr: It’s still very few pure SaaS RFPs come out. Occasionally that occurs and when it does, sometimes SaaS companies have been in there pre-selling and driving it. But that’s still a limited bit of the market. Generally, they are looking for a solution and they almost assume that it would be an on-premises solution and through the process, through Tyler and maybe through other exposure, other vendors they learn more and more about the SaaS offering and migrate in that direction. So, initially that’s not necessarily their intention and they kind of move in that direction. As we’ve said before and it continues to be the case, it’s not an all unusual that we’re selected as a vendor and they then look deeper into SaaS versus on-prem and it’s a subsequent decision as to which way they’re going to procure the system. And as Brian said earlier, we know SaaS was higher, we like to model ourselves, we’re successful with it. But really the long-term value of these clients is significant to us either way and we’re really glad for the business in a relatively non-biased way and have to get the business either way.
Charlie Strauzer: And John, when you think about the turning existing customers from license to SaaS, how much of that is driven by some of the kind of the user conferences year-over-year versus kind of just traditional self-guide knock on the door showing it to them?
John Marr: Well, their awareness is enhanced by both the participating. They use a conference or connect. User groups. There is a lot of user action in groups that that use the current [indiscernible], but our significant inside sales channel and their job is to have a relationship with that client and as I said earlier, whether they have got a big infrastructure investment that’s on the horizon, whether there is going to be significant turnover in that talent, through these relationships we’re very aware of when those catalysts will flip or coming and where they are making the more, what their options are. That’s really what that relationship is and what drives what we refer to what these flips and it’s a pretty steady business. The relationship with clients buy our solution, use it, get comfortable with us, we become a trusted partner, we have the benefit of licensee and then some number later they flip the SaaS that’s just a great customer relationship for us over the long-term and that something we see a lot of.
Charlie Strauzer: Great, thank you very much.
John Marr: Sure
Operator: At this time, there appears to be no more questions, Mr. Marr I’ll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.
John Marr: Great, Steven. Thank you. Appreciate everybody participating in the call today. If there are any further questions, feel free to reach out to Lynn, Brian and myself. Thanks again for your interest and have a great day.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Hello, and welcome to today's Tyler Technologies First Quarter 2018 Conference Call and Webcast. Your host for today's call is Mr. John Marr, Chairman and CEO of Tyler Technologies. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, May 3, 2018. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Marr. Please go ahead.
John S. Marr - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Thank you, Robert, and welcome to our First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. With me on the call today are Lynn Moore, our President; and Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like for Brian to give the Safe Harbor statement. Next, Lynn will have some preliminary comments. Brian will review the details of our first quarter results and update our 2018 guidance. Then I'll have some final comments and we'll take your questions. Lynn (sic) [Brian] (01:08)?
Brian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Thanks, John. During the course of this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information and may include projections concerning the company's future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. And are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We would refer to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the requirements of ASU No. 2014-09, Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, utilizing the full retrospective method of transition. Prior year amounts have been restated from previously-reported amounts to reflect the impact of the full retrospective adoption of Topic 606. We will provide details of the restated annual results for 2016 and quarterly results for 2017 in an 8-K filing next week in conjunction with our 10-Q filing. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Lynn?
H. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Thank, Brian. We put together a strong start to 2018 with our first quarter results. As total GAAP and non-GAAP revenues grew almost 11%. License and royalty revenues were $23 million, up 5%. Subscription revenues paced our growth with a 23% increase. Total recurring revenues from maintenance and subscriptions grew 13% and comprised 65% of total revenue. Since 2010, we have achieved greater than 20% growth in subscription revenues in 31 of the last 33 quarters. On April 30, we completed the acquisition of Socrata, Inc., a Seattle-based venture-backed technology company focused exclusively on accelerating the shift to digital government. With this acquisition, Tyler clients in every public sector vertical including justice, public safety, ERP financial and community development will have the opportunity to make their data discoverable, usable and actionable, while potentially including data from other jurisdictions to make analytics even more powerful and meaningful. The data-as-a-service solution will go beyond typical analytics to help local government understand procedural bottlenecks and create predictive models that will assist in improving government operations. Socrata is the industry leader in open data and data-as-a-service solutions for local government, providing cloud-based data integration, visualization, analysis, and reporting solutions for state, local and federal governments, as well as internationally, to improve their performance, increase accountability, gain better financial insights and extend citizen engagement. Founded in 2007, Socrata employs approximately 150 people. Socrata brings a roster of marquee Tier 0 and Tier 1 clients such as the Michigan State Budget Office, the Utah Department of Transportation, and general administration offices for several states including Texas, New York, Illinois and Pennsylvania and the cities of Los Angeles, Dallas and New York. With a robust cloud-based data management platform and a suite of data conceptualization applications, we expect to help find solutions to the challenges faced by governments in a significant way using big data. The acquisition will allow the business to tailor its solution to the needs of the public sector verticals we serve and achieve continued market growth potential. And Socrata employees and clients will benefit from our broad reach across the public sector space. Also on April 30, we acquired Sage Data Security, leading experts in cybersecurity. Sage offers a suite of service that's supports an entire cybersecurity lifestyle -lifecycle including program development, education and training, threat detection, technology testing, advisory services and digital forensics. Sage currently delivers three primary offerings to approximately 240 clients in the healthcare, financial, retail, education, and government sectors. The acquisition of Sage will allow us to provide our public sector clients with unique cybersecurity services that further protect their investment in Tyler solutions. Sage's nDiscovery offering pairs well with our solutions and allows us to provide additional value to our clients to manage cyber-attacks and data security issues as cybersecurity threats grow in scope and sophistication. Back to the quarter, subscription bookings made up a higher percentage of new software deals in the quarter compared to last year's first quarter, both in terms of the number of contracts and total contract value. We're pleased that we achieved double-digit revenue growth even with that new contract mix. Bookings comparison between quarters is somewhat skewed as in Q1 of 2017 we signed a $20 million contract with the State of New York for our tax solution. Our largest new license deal of the quarter was with Anchorage, Alaska for our iasWorld Appraisal & Tax solution, valued at approximately $3.6 million. We also signed a new license deal with the Northern Territory in Australia, expanding that relationship by adding our Odyssey Courts & Justice solution in additional courts down there. Other significant on-premise license deals signed during the quarter, each with a total contract value of $1 million or more included multi-product arrangements with Peoria, Illinois for our Munis and EnerGov solutions; Carson City, Nevada for our Munis, EnerGov and ExecuTime solutions; the Harrisonburg-Rockingham Emergency Communication Center in Virginia for our New World Public Safety, Brazos and SoftCode solutions; and Bedford County, Virginia, for our Munis and EnerGov solutions. As well as licensed deals for our Munis solution with the Pittsburgh Public Schools, the second largest school district in Pennsylvania, and the cities of Newton, Massachusetts, and Bentonville, Arkansas. Significant new SaaS contracts in the quarter included deals for our Munis solution for the cities of Gresham, Oregon; Fishers, Indiana; and Upper Darby Township in Pennsylvania. We also signed notable SaaS arrangements with Fresno County, California, for our Eagle Recorder solution and with the city of Rancho Cordova, California for our EnerGov solution. Finally, we signed an amendment with the Minnesota State Court Administrative (sic) [Administrator's] (8:03) Office, a current state-wide Odyssey client to include our Odyssey Supervision solution. Now I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on results for the quarter and update our annual guidance for 2018.
Brian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Thanks, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. I'm going to provide some additional data on the quarter's performance and update our annual guidance for 2018 and then John will have some additional comments. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. These measures excludes write-downs of acquisition-related deferred revenue and acquired leases, shared-based compensation expense, the employer portion of payroll taxes on employee stock transactions, and amortization of acquired intangibles. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We have also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financials and Annual Report tab schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. GAAP revenues for the first quarter were $221.2 million, up 10.7%. On a non-GAAP basis, revenues were $221.4 million, also up 10.7%. Revenue growth was strong, considering the higher percentage of subscription agreements in our bookings this quarter. Subscription revenues for the quarter increased 23%. We added 122 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 26 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $25 million in total contract value. In Q1 of last year, we added 92 new subscription-based arrangements and had 17 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $25.8 million in total contract value. Subscription clients represented approximately 63% of the number of new software contracts in the quarter, compared to 45% in the prior year quarter. While subscription contract value comprised 40% of the total new software contract value signed this quarter, compared to 29% in Q1 of last year. The value-weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter and Q1 of last year was 5.3 years. Transaction-based revenues from e-filing and online payments, which are included in subscriptions, increased 19.5% to $16.5 million, from $13.8 million last year. That amount includes e-filing revenue of $12.5 million, up 19.9% over last year. Annualized total non-GAAP recurring revenues for Q1 were $572 million, up 13.2% from last year. Cash flow from operations was $44.6 million compared to $48.2 million last year, down 7.4%. Free cash flow, which is calculated as cash from operations less capital expenditures, was $35.7 million, up 26%. Capital expenditures declined 55% due to the completion of our Yarmouth office expansion. Our CapEx for the quarter was $8.9 million including approximately $890,000 related to real estate, compared to total CapEx of $19.8 million in Q1 of last year, which included $7.8 million related to real estate. We ended the quarter with $307.2 million in cash and investments and no outstanding debt. Days sales outstanding in accounts receivable was 88 days at March 31, 2018, compared to 82 days at March 31, 2017. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $1.2 billion, up 16.8%. Backlog included $334.7 million of maintenance compared to $297.6 million a year ago. Subscription backlog was $467.9 million compared to $378.3 million last year and includes approximately $139 million related to fixed-fee e-filing contracts. Our bookings for the quarter, which are calculated from the change in backlog plus non-GAAP revenues, were solid at approximately $195 million, an increase of 9.5%. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1 billion. Our software subscription bookings in the first quarter added $4.6 million in new annual recurring revenue, up 17.8% from $3.9 million last year. For comparison, if all of our new subscription contracts had been under license arrangements, we estimate that they would have represented additional license bookings of approximately $5.7 million for the first quarter. Note that historic backlog and bookings numbers will also be restated to reflect the retrospective adoption of Topic 606. We signed 33 new contracts in the first quarter that included software licenses greater than $100,000 and those contracts had an average license of $387,000. Compared to 36 new contracts with an average license value of $707,000 in the first quarter of 2017, which included the $20 million contract with the State of New York. Our guidance for the full year of 2018 is as follows. We expect 2018 GAAP revenues will be between $933 million and $949 million, and non-GAAP revenues will be between $939 million and $955 million. We expect 2018 GAAP diluted EPS will be between $3.34 and $3.44 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock option exercises on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect 2018 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $4.73 and $4.83. For the year, estimated pre-tax non-cash, share-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $55 million. We expect R&D expense for the year will be approximately $58 million to $60 million. Fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between 40 million and 40.5 million shares. GAAP earnings per share assumes an estimated annual effective tax rate of 10% after discrete tax items and includes approximately $26 million of estimated discrete tax benefits related to share-based compensation, which may vary significantly based on the timing and volume of stock option exercises. We estimate the non-GAAP annual effective tax rate for 2018 will be 24%. This rate was reduced from 35% for 2017 to reflect the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We expect our total capital expenditures will be between $22 million and $25 million for the year. Total depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $64 million, including approximately $41 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to John for his final comments.
John S. Marr - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Thank you, Brian. Our first quarter results met or exceeded our expectations. We achieved solid double-digit revenue growth, even as subscriptions made up a higher percentage of new software contracts. Margins were in line with our expectations, as we began to ramp up our discretionary R&D investment we outlined at the beginning of the year. We are increasing our R&D spend on a number of projects company-wide in 2018. And R&D expenses is expected to increase by approximately 23% to 27% over 2017. We are underway and making good progress with several of these initiatives. Although the higher R&D spend pressures short-term margins, we are confident these investments further strengthen our competitive position and drive meaningful addition to future revenues. We are excited about the acquisitions of Socrata and Sage. Both of these companies bring Tyler a wealth of valuable expertise in areas that are top-of-mind for the public sector entities: data analytics and cybersecurity. We welcome their clients and employees to the Tyler family. We will leverage our sales organization and customer base to drive growth at Socrata and Sage that will – that we expect to exceed our overall revenue growth rates. While Socrata will be dilutive to earnings for the balance of 2018, we expect it will be accretive in 2019. We've updated our full-year guidance to include the operations of the acquired businesses for the last eight months of 2018. Our current outlook for Tyler's core business is positive, and we're pleased that our guidance for the non-GAAP earnings per share is unchanged, even with the acquisition dilution. Finally, we want to thank the nearly 5,000 clients who attended Connect 2018, our annual user conference, last week in Boston. Clients took part in over 1,000 classes over 54 educational tracks, and we continue to share with them our vision of connected communities and the progress we've made on that since last year. Now, Robert, we'll take questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. As a courtesy, we ask that you limit yourself to one question at a time. Please know, however, that there will or may be an opportunity later to re-enter the question queue. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. The first question comes from Brent Bracelin of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Brent Bracelin - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. One for John and one for Brian, if I could here. John, with the acquisition of Socrata, with the investments you've made in the Public Safety products over the last year, what's the broader strategy around Tier 1, Tier 0 cities? Walk us through your appetite. Are you getting kind of pulled into that environment or do you see an opportunity to kind of disrupt the status quo in those larger city environments?
John S. Marr - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: No, not really. Obviously we do creep up into the Tier 1 and Tier 0 marketplace as we move forward and that helps us expand the addressable markets we're working within. Courts & Justice probably has the biggest presence, doing very large cities, large counties and state-wide implementations, as you know. And we'll continue to kind of creep in that space but it is not a high-priority initiative for us. The deals below that level are much more product-oriented and less project-oriented and as you get into very large Tier 0 deals, they take on a life of their own. There's a lot of product expansion issues and, again, they come to be very service-intensive and more project-oriented. We do prefer product-intensive implementations where the license fees are a higher percentage of the engagement or the subscription fees and the post-implementated run rates, recurring run rates are higher as a percentage of the overall contract. That's what drives our model in a way that's most productive for us. So, again, we'll continue to inch in that direction, but it'd be a mistake to think that that's the highest priority for us. Socrata, obviously, has a strong presence there. They'll continue to pursue that with their direct sales resources but Tyler's role there will be able to productize it even further, make the – what are typically APIs that they have with various different applications in these areas, make those interfaces more seamless and ready out-of-the-box, lower service deliverable, and take the success they have had in the very large governments and drive that down into the mid-tiers where we have a bigger presence.
Brent Bracelin - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Very helpful. And then, Brian, just as you think about kind of the R&D investments this year, you do now have two acquisitions and those bring some engineering talent as well. Does this give you more flexibility to moderate kind of your investments in R&D this year and leverage some of their engineering teams? Or are you working on different projects and that's not the way we should kind of think about the flexibility you have on R&D this year.
Brian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: I think it's more the latter. I think both Socrata and Sage's R&D talent is fully focused on their initiatives. Certainly, there would be integrations with Tyler products and as we continue to tie those together that will be added to their plates. But I don't think we expect those to change our R&D spend or the projects that we already have underway pre-acquisitions.
Brent Bracelin - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Rob Oliver of Baird. Please go ahead.
Rob Oliver - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Guys, on Socrata, just curious for some more color around the product integration plan. I think – we are the new folks here, but I think according to our math it's the largest deal you guys have done since New World, so – and that was a separate product area. This is going to be more an integration on top of your existing products. So, just want to understand kind of how we should look for that product integration pathway. Thank you.
John S. Marr - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Socrata typically is application-agnostic. So, they typically go into sites and run over all kinds of different applications. Obviously, we have a strong presence and they're out there and we've gotten to know each other. And so many Tyler clients are Socrata clients as well and have already done that interface work. We will, as we go forward, as I said to the earlier question, we will take what a typical – typically application interfaces that have to be put in place during any implementation. And with the Tyler application, certainly our larger platforms make that more of an out-of-the-box interface that works more seamlessly and eliminate that need on a site-by-site basis. We'll still do those types of interfaces to non-Tyler applications. And sites will be able to interface and have a user experience that addresses all of their applications, whether they're Tyler or not. But it'll enable it to be much more ready, lower implementation service needs, and make it more viable in the mid-range accounts where it's been most successful historically than higher accounts.
Rob Oliver - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks, John. I have a couple more, but I can hop into the back of the queue. Thank you, guys.
Operator: The next question comes from Peter Heckmann with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.
Peter J. Heckmann - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Morning, everyone. Apologize if I missed it, but on Sage, I'm inferring that the annualized run rate revenue is close to $15 million. Is that about right? And I would assume it'd be somewhere around neutral to slightly accretive on an annual basis?
Brian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: No, Sage's revenues are in the $7 million to $8 million range. And it is roughly neutral to slightly accretive.
Peter J. Heckmann - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. So in terms of then what you're adding on the annualized basis to Socrata, I think you said in the press release it was $25 million of run rate revenue, but it sounds like you're thinking on an annualized basis, maybe something closer to $30 million?
Brian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. Their last fiscal year was $25 million. And so, yes, it'd be more in the $30 million range this year.
Peter J. Heckmann - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Got it. Got it. Okay. And then, just real quick, could you give us an update on the application you've developed in Illinois for searching court filings? And whether or not that is at a point where you think you could market it to other states?
H. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, Peter, this is Lynn. That – we're still – we're finalizing that for research, the research product for Illinois. It's targeted to go out the last half of this year and go live. We do think it's fairly portable. It will – I think it will fairly be easy to move from state to state. But you should expect to see results from that later this year.
Peter J. Heckmann - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Great. I appreciate it.
Operator: The next question comes from Alex Zukin of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Alex J. Zukin - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe, Brian, a couple for you? You mentioned as a percentage of bookings over the past few quarters, subscription has gotten to be maybe a little bit north of your expectations on a pretty continuous basis. And I guess my question is what is the expectation for the full year at this point? How confident you are in that projection? And I'll stop there for a second.
Brian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Well, it bounces around a lot from quarter to quarter, and the mix is – some of it is somewhat random. Although, as we've said in the past, we do expect in the long-term to continue to see a shift towards subscription. Last year, for the full year, it was about, in terms of contract value, 63% license-based and 37% subscription. So actually this quarter, although it was higher than last year, it was still reasonably in line with that. The fourth quarter typically has a higher license mix with a higher level of business for Public Safety, which is almost exclusively a license business. And certainly large contracts, which tend to be more license-based, affect that. And in this quarter, the revenue mix didn't include any of the mega contracts. It was much more normal bread and butter kinds of contracts. So we have a range of expectations for the year, and I'd say they generally encompass something – a mix that's slightly below the last year's numbers in terms of the percentage that were subscription to a few points above that in terms of the overall mix. I guess the midpoint would be somewhere around a similar mix to last year. So, for the full year, when you take into account larger contracts that may come in during the year, as well as the second half of the year, Public Safety surge, we'd expect sort of a modest expansion in terms of the mix that comes in as subscriptions.
Alex J. Zukin - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Got it. And then on free cash flow, I think for the quarter it was a little light of kind of our expectations or consensus. So, I know it's not a number you guide for, but I just wanted to understand maybe what was different. Anything in collections? Or how should we think about free cash flow for the balance of the year from a growth perspective?
Brian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: It's mostly related. The lower cash from operations and the change in working capital is mostly related to a higher balance of unbilled revenue. You will see some movement in that and between unbilled and deferred revenue with the switch to Topic 606. So there's some sort of changes on the back-end going on there. But the total increase in unbilled revenue is primarily related to just the specific billing terms on several contracts, particularly some larger contracts, where we've been able to recognize revenue prior to being able to bill it in accordance with the contract terms. That will all turnaround, we think, a fair amount of that during this year. So we still expect – and obviously, our CapEx for the year is projected to be about half of what our CapEx was last year. So, we still look to see a nice increase in cash flow for the full year.
Alex J. Zukin - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Got it. Is it possible just to get a sense for how – what was the impact of that unbilled in the quarter in terms of revenue recognized but cash flow that was not billed?
Brian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Well, unbilled – let's see. Unbilled was – see, our unbilled receivables at March 31 were about $65 million. At December, it was about $52 million. So, there's about a $13 million increase in our unbilled receivables.
Alex J. Zukin - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Perfect. Thank you, guys.
Operator: The next question comes from Scott Berg of Needham & Company. Please go ahead.
Scott Berg - Needham & Co. LLC: Hi, John, Lynn and Brian. Congrats on a good quarter. I have one and a follow-up. They're both pretty brief. John or Lynn, wanted to see if you wanted to comment a little bit on the expansion deal in the Northern Territory of Australia. I assume they're pretty pleased with the initial implementation that's led to this one, but just broader speaking, how do you reflect on any potential international efforts with the success of that initial contract?
H. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. Hey, Scott. It's Lynn. Yeah, I think, all in all, our first toe in the water down there, I think, has been quite a success. We got them up running, up live, on time, extremely happy. So what you see here is they've actually expanded some additional court types, which I think reflects our execution down there. It is, as you know, it's a fairly small state in Australia, but getting off the ground and being successful there was certainly very important. It's our first real international foray in the Courts area. I do think there are some additional opportunities in Australia. I think there will be some coming up in the next 12 to 18 months, perhaps sooner, and I think we're going to be well-positioned there by virtue of the fact of how we did perform down in the Northern Territory.
Scott Berg - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. Then just a brief follow-up for Brian. With the revised guidance that includes the two acquisitions, I was kind of surprised your R&D expense didn't increase from the prior guidance. I assume each of those companies was at least spending a little on R&D combined, which have -probably would have made your number go up and maybe your guidance just is now going to be on the high end of that range versus maybe on the lower end before. But just wanted to comment a little bit on integration efforts there because I thought there'd be a fair amount, at least in the short term.
Brian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yes, and both of those, obviously, just closed a couple days ago. And so, we really haven't – although their earnings contributions and revenues are included in the guidance, I don't think we revised the R&D. We don't expect there to be any incremental R&D in total, but their R&D really hasn't – those numbers haven't been pulled out and added into that guidance. So that guidance we gave is really sort of Tyler, ex the acquisitions. They're reporting – they didn't necessarily report R&D the same way we do. So we'll update those numbers. But in total, we don't expect to add significant resources as a result of the acquisitions.
Scott Berg - Needham & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks. Helpful. I'll jump back in the queue.
Brian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: The next question comes from Jonathan Ho with William Blair & Company. Please go ahead.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to see if you could maybe update us in terms of the R&D investments this year and maybe what milestones we should be looking for in terms of the outcomes for those investments?
John S. Marr - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Well, they're pretty broad, Jonathan. And they're certainly by the kind of investments that roll out over time. So they're across many applications and many different functions. It can be features, it can be upgrades in user experiences. It could be working on new interfaces, certainly a lot going on around Nexus, Alliance and connected communities. So, it'd be a long list of different things. Certainly, Public Safety which has really been underway at an elevated level for two years is starting to show and release more of what they've been working on. So that's pretty ready. You saw our release this past quarter on EAM or enterprise asset management. So there's really a number of different applications that probably every quarter that there's a new release in some application every quarter or so that there's an upgrade in the demonstration on products that we're presenting. So it will be a consistent release of new features, new functions, better technology, better user experiences. And I think we think it's already impacting some decisions, both decisions themselves, whether or not we win a deal, as well as whether or not someone includes EnerGov or someone includes ExecuTime or EAM or other applications that we have developed with the intention of making these deals bigger to begin with or to sell them back through the installed base.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Kirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC: Thanks very much. John, maybe you mentioned with Socrata a lot of your customers already are using them. Can you just talk about, is that – is the buyer the same person? Meaning, when you think about the buyers for the applications, which would, I think, more likely than not be in the IT function, does Socrata sort of pull you guys up to another level within some of these state and government institutions in terms of the decision makers? Can you just talk about that conceptually, just in terms of how you think that could benefit you if at all from this combo?
John S. Marr - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, no, it's a good question. And – this is early and this is definitely an atypical deal for us. It's – we're more out ahead of it. This is not as essential as a payroll system or a court system, things we typically focus on. So we think we're out ahead of this. There's a strong player in the market in Socrata that we felt fit very well with us. Obviously, we have the most content on the backside of this and it makes a lot of sense. But admittedly, this is earlier stage than what we typically do. I think the answer would be both. Certainly, on the technology side, it's a lot of the same people. So, the IT leadership in the government that would be certainly involved in buying application software is going to be involved in that as well. But as you move away from that, instead of being led by application management users, this will get into a mayor's office, this will get into a governor's office, this will get into a little more of that side of the business, which is good for us. Our exposure historically has been with tax collectors and treasurers and accountants and judges and policemen and the people that run these applications along with the IT people and this will cross over into the executive offices. It's certainly got more of a citizen facing appeal. With our Nexus, Alliance and connected community strategies that pull all of our different back-office solutions together, I think that's a good thing. So again, it'll be a gradual – this is a long-term investment for us, but it will process over into the executive side of governments, and I think that's a good thing when you look at the comprehensive Tyler objectives.
Kirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC: That's very helpful. And then one for Brian. Brian, when I look at Socrata and Sage, could you just give us a little bit of an overview of the – how the revenue – the composition of the revenue, meaning subscription versus license versus professional services for those two companies, split up however you want. But I was just kind of curious of how we should see that contribution sort of roll on to the income statement? Thanks.
Brian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, I don't have the exact mixes, but Socrata is heavily weighted towards subscriptions. They are a pure cloud business, hosted at AWS, and it's around 90% subscriptions. And then there's a small professional services revenue stream along with that. As John talked about earlier, those are typically not big service engagements related to those implementations. Sage is also a mixture of subscription-based for their in nDiscovery services, which is their lead product, as well as professional services that go along with that around the cybersecurity services that we provide. So it's a little bit more of a mix, but both of them are primarily subscription-based businesses.
Kirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC: Great. Thanks very much, and congrats on the acquisitions.
Brian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Mark Schappel with Benchmark. Please go ahead.
Mark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. John, could you just speak to the growth rate of the Public Safety business in the quarter? And if I recall correctly, the plan was to punch it up to about 9% this year from about 6% to 7% last year. And based on what you're seeing in the pipeline here, I was wondering if you could give us some indication whether that's on track?
John S. Marr - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: It's on track. It might be on the lower end of the range of expectations we had. After an acquisition, there really were a lot of moving parts related to different revenues and things that almost make it difficult to get very good comparisons. So they're kind of working through those things. The reception's been very good to the investments we're making. The customer satisfaction referencability has clearly improved significantly, and we're pleased with all of those things. But again, I think we are working through some transitional issues that have made the growth rate a little more stubborn for a little bit longer. But at this point, the leading indications of the win rates and the improvement in the competitive position and then, again, stability in the customer base and their ongoing revenues make us very confident that they'll see accelerated growth in the coming quarters.
Brian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: And their business is really, as we've talked about in the past, heavily weighted in the second half of the year. So it's difficult to draw a conclusion from just the first quarter. As John said, we're generally on track for the full year with – in line with our expectations.
Mark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Zach Cummins with B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead.
Zach Cummins - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So with Socrata anticipated to be dilutive to 2018 and you're still maintaining your prior R&D guidance for your core Tyler solutions, can you talk about if there's any anticipated cost savings? Where those, any of those, may be coming from for you to maintain your prior pro forma EPS guidance?
Brian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: I think the biggest difference, clearly, we communicated that Socrata would be dilutive. And with us maintaining the same guidance, clearly there's some outperformance in other areas of the business, and those are not isolated in any one area. But effectively, the core Tyler business is performing a little stronger for the full year and making up for the Socrata dilution. It's not a lot of dilution. It's in the – I'd say in the $0.05 to $0.10 a share range. And, again, that's the dilution offset by outperformance across the rest of the business.
Zach Cummins - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Great. That's really helpful. And then just one other quick question. I saw that Socrata kind of – they have a small federal government business. I know Tyler has historically been focused on the state and local level, but if opportunities on the federal side were to present themselves, would you be interested in pursuing any of those?
John S. Marr - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: With Socrata or with our other applications?
Zach Cummins - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Both, I suppose. With – would you be more aggressive in pursuing federal opp6ortunities with Socrata and then would Tyler, with their core business, be open to pursuing some if they became available?
John S. Marr - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: With both these acquisitions, we're going to be careful to make sure that they continue to execute on what their core strategies were. So their traditional markets, which are a little different than ours in both cases, their direct sales resources will continue to focus that – on that and develop it. So in the case of Socrata, certainly, their direct resources will continue to pursue federal deals. At some point in time, down the road, those relationships certainly could be something that's interesting on our application side and we're always looking to expand our addressable markets as we go forward. So I wouldn't look for that to be a high priority over the next, say, 12 to 24 months, but certainly further down the road, it could be.
Zach Cummins - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: All right. Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: The next question comes from Patrick Walravens of JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
Patrick D. Walravens - JMP Securities LLC: Great. Thank you. And let me add my congratulations. So, John, I heard a mention of embedding sort of more AI, machine learning kind of functionality and having that helps solve some problems for your customers. So, I would love to hear a couple examples of where you think that would work. And then, I'd also love to hear your thoughts sort of at a broader level – I mean, your software runs governments and police departments, so it seems to me that making sure that any AI you put in reflects human values and justice and fairness and accountability and that kind of thing is a lot more important than for most software companies. I'd love to hear your thoughts on that, too.
John S. Marr - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. Well, again, all these things are somewhat early to us but we – you're right. Sat through our Courts & Justice and our Public Safety presentations at Connect last week in Boston and there's no question that the track we were already on with connected communities and now putting Socrata out in front of that, that our ability to take different information and different data that's in these systems and integrate it and present it in ways that are more actionable and provide the kind of information that city, county and state leaders would use to make decisions. But also businesses and citizens that are interacting with those communities as well. So, a lot of those specifics are to follow. But I think there's an exciting opportunity there and I think this will accelerate our connected community strategy and bring it to constituents that traditionally we didn't serve.
Patrick D. Walravens - JMP Securities LLC: And Brian, can I just ask, so how should we think about sort of margin expansion once we get – and I know you're not going to want to be too specific, but – and once we get past 2018?
Brian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yes. We said long-term that we continue to expect over, say, a multiyear period, maybe a four-, five-year period, a rolling period that we believe that if we're growing this low double-digit range, 10%, 11%, 12%, that we should over time expect to see an average of, say, 100 basis points a year or more of operating margin expansion. Clearly, that's being pressured this year and we're – our guidance is below that in terms of actually it's a little bit of contraction with the increased R&D spend, all of which is expensed in our financials. But we still believe that longer-term model of 100 basis points a year on average. Now, whether we get all the way back to that after 2018 in the first year is yet to be seen, but we could expect to perhaps outperform that beyond that. So, if you're looking out over the next few years, we'd expect that to be the target.
Patrick D. Walravens - JMP Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: At this time there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Marr, I would like to turn the conference back over to you for any closing remarks.
John S. Marr - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Robert, and thank you all for participating on our call today. If you do have any further questions, feel free to reach out to Lynn Moore, Brian Miller, or myself. Thanks again. Have a great day.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Hello everyone. And welcome to today's Tyler Technologies’ Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2017 Conference Call. Your host for today's call is John Marr, Chairman and CEO of Tyler Technologies. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded today, February 22, 2018. At this time, I would like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Marr. Sir, please go ahead.
John Marr: Thank you, Jaime. And welcome to our fourth quarter 2017 earnings call. With me on the call today, are Lynn Moore, our President; and Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like to Brian to give the Safe Harbor statement. Next, Lynn will have some preliminary comments. Then Brian will review the details of our fourth quarter results and 2018 guidance. Then I'll have some final comments, and we'll take your questions.
Brian Miller: Thanks, John. During the course of this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information, and may include projections concerning the Company's future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Lynn?
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. We are pleased with our results for the quarter, which provided the strong finish to 2017. We returned to double-digit revenue growth for the quarter with total GAAP revenue growth of 13% and non-GAAP revenue growth of 12%. We also achieved solid margin improvement as our non-GAAP operating margin rose 120 basis points to a new high. License and royalties revenues also reached to new high and exceeded $20 million for the first time ever. Subscription revenue was once again strong growing 26%. Total recurring revenues from maintenance and subscriptions grew 14% and comprised 64% of total revenue. Bookings for the quarter were very strong up 37%. For the year, bookings grew 15% compared to 2016 and our quarter end backlog grew 18% to just over $1.1 billion. Bookings were robust under both our license and subscription models, but then as expected, our new business mix in the fourth quarter shifted back toward a higher proportion of license deals than in the second and third quarters. Subscriptions represented about a third of the total new software contract value in the fourth quarter. The mix was impacted somewhat by a large state wide Odyssey contracts, as well as seasonally strong bookings for our public and safety solutions, which are typically on-premises license deals. Our largest new license deal in the quarter was the state wide Odyssey Courts & Justice's software contract with the state of Kansas Judicial Branch, valued at approximately $21 million, including a multiyear maintenance agreement. This represents our 14th state Odyssey arrangement. Other significant on-premises license deals signed during the quarter, each with a total contract value of $1 million or more included multiproduct arrangements with Marion County, Florida for our Munis, EnerGov and ExecuTime solutions, Norman, Oklahoma, for our Munis and EnerGov solutions, Fredericksburg, Virginia for our Munis iasWorld, EnerGov and ExecuTime solutions and Henry County, Georgia, in the Atlanta Metropolitan area, which signed contracts valued at $3.6 million for our New World Public Safety, Brazos and SoftCode solutions, as well as our Munis and EnerGov solutions. We had a very active quarter in the public safety market with the highest quarterly total contract signing since we acquired New World in 2015. Significant New World public safety license deals included the Cities of Orlando and Tallahassee, Florida, Elk County, Pennsylvania and Clayton County, Georgia, located in the Atlanta area. Clayton County also signed a significant license contract for our EnerGov solution and the Visalia Unified School District in California signed a major new contract for our Munis ERP solution. Significant new SaaS contracts in the quarter included multi-product deals for our Munis and EnerGov solutions with the cities of Wilmington, North Carolina and Wellington and Riviera Beach in Florida. We also signed notable SaaS arrangements with Fontana, California, and Muscogee Creek Nation in Oklahoma for our Munis ERP solution and with Edison, Illinois for our new world ERP solution. Finally, we signed a five-year $13 million extension of our state-wide e-filing contract with the State of Oregon, which is converting to a fixed fee arrangement. Now, I'd like to Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and provide our annual guidance for 2018.
Brian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017. I'm going to provide some additional data on the quarter's performance and provide our annual guidance for 2018. Then John will have some additional comments. In our earnings release, we’ve included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. These measures exclude write-downs of acquisition-related deferred revenue and acquired leases, share-based compensation expense, employer portion of payroll taxes on employee-stock transactions and amortization of acquired intangibles. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the investor relations section of our Web site under the financials and annual report tab, schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. GAAP revenues for the fourth quarter were $217.9 million, up 12.7%. On a non-GAAP basis, revenues were $218.1 million, up 11.8%. Subscription revenues for the quarter increased 26.1%. We added 83 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 19 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $44.4 million in total contract value. In Q4 of last year, we added 61 new subscription-based arrangements and had six on-premises conversions, representing approximately $18.4 million in total contract value. Subscription clients represented approximately 42% of the number of new software contracts in the quarter compared to 30% in the prior year quarter, while subscription contract value comprised 33% of the total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 19% in Q4 last year. The value-weighted average-term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 5.8 years compared to 5.6 years in last year's fourth quarter. Transaction-based revenues from e-filing and online payments, which are included in subscriptions, increased 28.2% to $16.3 million from $12.7 million last year. That amount includes e-filing revenue of $12.5 million, up 29.8% over the last year. The growth in e-filing revenues was primarily driven by the ramp-up of e-fling and research solutions in Illinois. Annualized total non-GAAP recurring revenues for the fourth quarter were $563 million, up 14.2% from last year. Our GAAP effective tax rate was significantly impacted by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act bind in the December, mainly due to the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new corporate tax rate, which reduce our tax provision for the year and the quarter by approximately $21.6 million and reduced our full year tax rate by 13.4%. In addition, our GAAP tax rate includes significant excess tax benefit from stock option exercises, which reduced our tax provision for the year by approximately $40.6 million and reduced our full year tax rate by 25.1%. As a very profitable company with nearly all of our operations in the U.S., we expect that our effective rate going forward will reflect a significant reduction as a result of the new lower federal tax rates. Cash flow from operations was $53.4 million compared to $51.8 million last year, up 3%. Free cash flow, which is calculated as cash from operations less CapEx, was $48.1 million up 10.2%. Our CapEx for the quarter was $5.3 million, including $4.9 million related to real estate compared to total CapEx of $8.2 million in Q4 of last year. Cash flow for the quarter was negatively impacted by the timing of milestone billings associated with certain large contracts, which resulted in a higher than normal level of unbilled receivables, as well as by higher federal tax payments that resulted in a higher prepaid tax position at year-end. We ended the quarter with $249.7 million in cash and investments and no outstanding debt. Day sales outstanding and accounts receivable was 94 days at December 31, 2017 compared to 93 days at December 31, 2016. In Q4, we repurchased 2,600 shares of our common stock at an average of the $169.93 per share. For the full year of 2017, we repurchased 44,496 share of our common stock at an average of $148.62 per share. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was a record $1.1 billion, up 17.6%. Software-related backlog, which excludes backlog from appraisal services contracts, was $1.1 billion and 18.4% increase. Backlog included $279.9 million of maintenance compared to $242.7 million a year ago. Subscription backlog was $459.2 million compared to $364.1 million last year and includes approximately $148 million related to 60 e-filing contracts. Our bookings for the quarter, which are calculated from the change in backlog plus non-GAAP revenues, were approximately $290 million, an increase of 36.8%. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1 billion, a 14.8% increase which is a new annual high. A new metric that we are now providing is the annual recurring revenues of new software subscriptions. Our software subscription bookings in the fourth quarter added a total of $7.1 million in new annual recurring revenue, up 155.5% from $2.8 million last year. For the full year, we added $24.9 million as the annual recurring revenue from software subscriptions, up 61.1%. For comparison, if all of our new subscription contracts had been under license arrangements, we estimate that they would have represented additional license bookings of approximately $7.8 million for the fourth quarter and $33 million for the full year. We signed 48 new contracts in the fourth quarter that included software licenses greater than $100,000, and those contracts had an average license of $468,000 compared to 57 new contracts with an average license value of $406,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Our guidance for the full year of 2018, which reflects the preliminary estimated impact of the adoption of ASC 606 effective January 01, 2018 is as follows. We expect 2018 GAAP revenues will be between $912 million and $928 million and non-GAAP revenues will be between $913 million and $929 million. We expect 2018 GAAP diluted EPS will be approximately between $3.65 and $3.75, and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock option exercises on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect 2018 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be approximately $4.73 to $4.83. For the year, estimated pretax non-cash share-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $49 million. We expect R&D expense for the year will be approximately $58 million to $60 million. Fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between 40 million and 40.5 million shares. GAAP earnings per share assumes an estimated annual effective tax rate of 11% after discrete tax items, and includes approximately $26 million of discrete tax benefits related to share-based compensation, which may vary significantly based on the timing and volume of stock option exercises. We estimate the non-GAAP effective tax rate for 2018 will be approximately 24%. This rate was reduced from 35% for 2017 to reflect the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This rate is based on Tyler's estimated annual GAAP income tax forecast adjusted to account for items excluded from GAAP income in calculating Tyler's non-GAAP income, as well as significant non-recurring tax adjustments. The non-GAAP tax rate used in future periods will be reviewed periodically to determine whether it remains appropriate in consideration of factors, including Tyler's periodic effective tax rate calculated in accordance with GAAP, changes resulting from tax legislation, changes in the geographic mix of revenues and expenses, and other factors deemed significant. We expect our total capital expenditures will be approximately $22 million to $25 million. Total depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $59 million, including approximately $35 million of amortization of acquisition intangibles. The actual impact of ASC 606 is obviously subject to a number of variables and uncertainties, including the mix and timing of new contracts and specific terms contained in individual contracts. For comparison purposes, under the prior ASC 605 basis, our guidance for 2018 would be as follows: GAAP total revenues would be expected to be in the range of $918 million to $934 million; non-GAAP total revenues would be expected to be in the range of $919 million to $935 million; GAAP diluted earnings per share would be expected to be between $3.75 and $3.85; and Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share would be expected to be between $4.81 and $4.91. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to John for historical further comments
John Marr: Thank you, Brian. This was another very strong quarter for Tyler, and we're pleased that we reached the high end of our earnings guidance with our highest quarterly non-GAAP operating margin ever. But the year we exceeded the upper end of our initial earnings guidance even as we faced a significant revenue headwind with higher than expected level of subscription in our new contract mix.  Looking back to 2017, we’re particularly pleased with the progress we made in the public safety area. We significantly expanded our presence in the market with the New World acquisition in late 2015. In 2016, we laid the ground work for that business, investing in the client support organization, developing a strong roadmap for Tyler Reliance and our Integrated Public Safety and Courts and Justice Solution and strengthening our sales organization and process. Those efforts showed tangible results in the market in 2017. We are progressing very well with major development projects that are adding features and functionality to strengthen our competitive position and enable us to compete effectively at the upper end of the public safety market. The market is viewing our strategy positively. Although, growth in our public safety division was well below our blended company rates in 2017, our public safety win rates and the number of new clients added during the year more than doubled. We also have had success in selling additional Tyler solutions, such as our Brazos e-citation solution into the New World client base. The public safety space has a number of good competitors, but we have a focused long-term strategy and we believe Tyler has unique advantages that will enable us to continue to build momentum and accelerate growth in the coming years. Public safety is certainly not the only area for our business where we’re investing at high level and product development initiatives. As we outlined at the beginning of last year, we ramped up our R&D spend on a number of project companywide in 2017. And R&D expense increased approximately 10% to $47.3 million in 2017. As we previously discussed, we have an ongoing white space analysis through which we identify gaps in our product suits and prioritize opportunities to improve the competitiveness of our products, broaden our offerings and expand our addressable market. In many of these cases, we consider bill versus by scenarios. While we continue to pursue strategic acquisitions in many M&A process, especially those that are banker led, we’ve seen transactions take place at valuations that are often well and excess of the level we consider reasonable. We always expect to pay fair prices for our acquisitions. But over the years, we believe we've excised discipline and patients when it comes to making the right decisions on acquisitions. Our cash flow is robust and growing, and will be enhanced by the reduction of our tax rate starting this year. In addition, with the completion of the expansion of our Yarmouth office, our 2018 capital expenditures will be approximately half of the 2017 level. Our balance sheet is extremely strong with $249.7 million in cash and investments, and no debt at year end. Against that backdrop, we have identified a number of internal development projects that we believe offer high potential to help drive growth and achieve our product objectives, and we’ve made the decision to incrementally increase our discretionary investments in internal product development. As Brian noted in our guidance, we plan to increase our R&D expense by 23% to 27% in 2018 to a total of between $58 million and $60 million. While the incremental expense is small relative to our cash flow, all of our software development is expensed. So the short-term earnings effect is more meaningful. These new discretionary investments stand our products suites including ERP, planning, regulatory maintenance, courts and public safety. Some of these projects will add features, functionality and technology to enhance our current products and improve our competitive position. Other projects will broaden our offering with new products that will drive new revenue streams. In addition, we are adding resources to our enterprise development group, which focuses on Tyler wide development initiatives that further our connected communities’ vision. Our singular focus on the public sector help having a deep understanding of our market, anticipating client needs and innovating through long-term vision, such as connected communities have been Tyler’s strength for many years. And we're confident in our ability to continue to make both organic and external investments that will further our strategy and drive long-term success. We have a solid plan for 2018. There is some noise around the numbers with accounting changes from ASC 606. Looking at our 2018 guidance under ASC 605 accounting comparable to 2017, our non-GAAP revenue growth is just over 10% at the midpoint of our range and our GAAP EPS growth at the midpoint under 605 is 24%. We look forward to building on our fourth quarter with an acceleration of revenues and earnings growth while ramping our R&D investments to drive future growth. Now, Jaime we will take questions.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we’ll begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. And our first question today comes from Kirk from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.
Kirk Materne: John, I guess the first question I had is for you just on the R&D increase. It seems like it's somewhat opportunistic for you guys to try and take advantage of your position in the market, and the fact things are going well. But I'm just curious. Is this the new norm, this level of spend on an absolute dollar basis? And should -- after we up level this year, should that -- should the incremental growth on R&D normalize back to be in line with revenue or potentially slower than revenue growth as we think about 2019?
John Marr: It's a great question, Kirk and it's hard to answer just because we don’t want to handcuff ourselves going forward. I appreciate that now for a couple of years, we've talked about incremental R&D spend that’s discretionary and widens the moat in terms of our leadership position, and at the same time, indentify some new opportunities and broadens our addressable market. That happened last year and we’re reinforcing and maybe even raising the bar a little bit this year. I generally believe what we’re doing is moving investments that could happen over a longer period of time forward, and adding heads. We certainly add it a lot of heads last year of public safety that could have been done over a longer period of time, but we felt we’re on a position to make those investments and we felt they were important to do. And this year, we’ve identified similar opportunities across the suite of applications that we think are very good investments for us to make. You combine that with looking at the market today, and as you said being opportunistic. And we're not buying a lot of our stock back, we're not doing a lot of M&A,that certainly could change at any time. But we're in a very strong position to make these investments, and we think it's the right thing to do. It'd be my expectation that again these are moving headcount and investments forward; and will create some lumpiness in the R&D spend; and that we'll grow into it; and we'll achieve the same margins that we've always expected to. But I'd be cautious, because if we see great opportunities in the future that we believe deserve funding, then we'll fund. So again, a very good question and we'll certainly be as transparent as we can be going forward. We certainly see higher margins and we believe they're completely available to us today. But we think these are the right investment levels for Tyler to have at this point in time.
Kirk Materne: And then for Brian, just how should we think about the tax -- lower tax rates, again your cash flow. Meaning are there any -- obviously EPS is going up, it's on a lower non-GAAP tax rate. Does that flow directly through to the cash flow number? I guess, I am just trying to get a sense on how should we think about operating cash flow growth, next year?
Brian Miller: Yes, the reduction in the tax rate generally does flow through to cash taxes. So that starting point of going down from roughly 35% to 24%, before the discreet items from stock option exercises, which is a less predictable number but also a cash number, should flow right down to our cash tax provision as well.
Kirk Materne: So should I think about operating cash flow growing roughly in the same range as EPS next year, is that a fair way or a decent starting point?
Brian Miller: Yes, I'd say that's a pretty decent starting point.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Kinstlinger from Maxim Group. Please go ahead with your question.
Brian Kinstlinger: Can you talk about your top two or three priorities in terms of product set that you plan to employ the increased R&D budget?
John Marr: Well, this year, Brian, different than last year I would have answered public safety, obviously, that we elevated that specifically and the elevation there was disproportionate to other areas. Although, there were again number of discretionary heads added across the other areas as well. This year it's broader, so I can't give you two or three that stand out, it's definitely spread out across significant -- most of our primary applications. There's a fair amount happening at Munis and those are across the board, these functions, technology and innovation really all across the board. So there aren’t one or two lead projects, it's really a distribution ahead across the different applications that we think all make sense.
Brian Kinstlinger: And then my second question is, you mentioned bookings for public safety were the strongest since acquiring New World, and I think you doubled the number of client wins and your win rate. So how far along are you in a process of improving the competitive positioning, being able to bid on larger contracts, and having a more consistent win rate as opposed to maybe this is one quarter maybe two quarters of solid wins?
John Marr: The first result is improved win rates in that traditional market, and we've already seen that that actually are pretty consistent with win rates. There’s really been about three quarters now that we’re seeing something in 50% to 100% improvement in there win rates. So that’s we’re cautious to believe whether or not that sustainable. But certainly, those results are very encouraging. The second phase of that is to broaden the addressable market space, namely moving up in the larger jurisdictions and that’s a process. We don’t all of a sudden set the bar at jurisdictions that are several times the size with traditionally been competitive, we’ll gradually grow into that space, and that’s happening. I think we will see -- you will never know for certain, which deals you would have or not would have won historically. But I think we’ll see deals in the first half of this year that will reflect a more competitive position in the larger jurisdictions.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Zukin from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead with your question.
Alex Zukin: First, couple of questions just on the guidance, on the same track of as the previous question for public safety. Can you talk about what your guidance for 2018 implies for growth in that business versus the corporate average and compare that to 2017 as well.
John Marr: It will again be modestly below the blended Tyler rate. So the win rates experienced in the marketplace are still somewhat leading indicators, but those manifesting themselves in the P&L the back it up are still a little ways out. So we anticipate that public safety to actual recognize revenue this year, will again be modestly below the overall Tyler blended rate.
Lynn Moore: This is Lynn, just to supplement that. I think there were still some headwinds coming out of the acquisition that are being overcome or that have been overcome by our public safety division. And I think that you see that has an impact as well on the slightly below Tyler rate. But we expect that in the future to catch up and accelerate, and be in line or actually help drive the growth rate going forward.
Alex Zukin: And I guess what types of indicators are you guys looking for? Because you’re talking about, over the next couple of years, for this rate to be well ahead potentially the corporate average. So what do you need to see, or has anything changed over the last three or six months to influence that opinion?
John Marr: Well, it takes so while. It’s taking probably three years by the time we're done from the beginning through this year for things to settle out. So when we get the company, churn rates were higher and they don’t stop overnight, they are coming down. Tyler generally experiences almost zero, very, very low churn, so that’s an initiatives that has to settle out and is improved on. Wining this business and improving backlog to work from is happening. Again, that leading indicator is reinforced by their experience in the marketplace. And the last thing to happen is that actually shows up in the financial results. And I think we're looking at later this year and early next year, we’ll start to see their overall top line growth rate accelerate to and then beyond Tyler’s overall rate. And I think that will driver higher margins. The margins are lower now than when we acquired them based on these discretionary investments that we’re making. And we think they will go back to where they were over the next 12 to 18 months certainty.
Alex Zukin: And then the other item around guidance. Could you give us a sense for, given the mix shift to subscription in 2017 was a bit ahead of your expectations. Can you talk about how you’re handicapping that for 2018? Do you feel like you need to take a more conservative approach to this given just the dynamics in the industry of your drive to cloud? And help us get a sense for how you’re thinking about that?
John Marr: Yes, I think we’ve definitely take into account in our planning process. The mix doesn’t impact each of our business lines equally. We had warrants and businesses that are on POC, so it doesn’t impact it. But in our larger areas in Munis, we certainly budgeted in a higher than traditional adoption rate, I wouldn’t say it's meaningfully higher, but it's certainly higher. And that's two add a little more conservative into our plan.
Brian Miller: Clearly, as we've talked about a number of times, the mix is lumpy and it varies quite a bit from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. It's also interesting to note that for 2017, the mix between licenses and subscription and new deals based on dollar volume 63% license, 37% subscription, was exactly the same as it was in 2015. So over that three year period, it's shaking out to be the same. And we do expect that over the long-term there’ll be more of a shift, but our -- the midpoint of our guidance assumes a fairly similar mix to what we saw in 2017. And as you've seen we've widened the range a bit on our guidance, which also gives us a little more room to accommodate to various outcomes that we could do.
Alex Zukin: And then just the last one from me and this is a bigger picture questions. But John, given the breadth of the portfolio increasing, given the incremental investments you’re making in R&D. Could you -- I mean we're not now looking for a long-term guide here. But just give me your comfort level for a time horizon that you anticipate being able to maintain double-digit revenue growth. Is this something you think you can do over the next five to 10 years? Is this something that could start to dip a little bit over the next couple of years? Just trying to get a sense of that long-term durability?
John Marr: Well, certainly all those things could happen. We dipped down here this past year just below the double-digit level for the year. We're pleased in the fourth quarter we comfortably get back in the double-digits. As we said in the call, the midpoint of our guidance for this year is a little bit above 10%. We believe that the investments we’re making and the things we're doing are helping to curve that backup. And everything we're doing, these investments we’re making and everything we do in the marketplace is to bend that curve backup and get it comfortably above 10% again. And all indications to us are that that's very reasonable. I don’t know for certain where the growth rate will be three years from now. But we think we have this core growth rate as to weigh the company work. If you take nearly zero attrition; and you take price increases; and you take tail of the on-premise sales we sell and the contribution to recurring revenues there; if you take the deals we know about on the e-file horizon, there are already customers; you look at the SaaS business and those run rates; that puts out about an 8% or 9% growth rate for the overall company here. And so I think that’s absent any major change in the industry or our position in the industry is our core growth rate is the way we look at it. And so these incremental investments and these things we’re doing, which are a big focus ours and where we’re spending a lot of a discretionary money we’re spending are all about adding that other 2%, 3%, 4%, to get you to the traditional growth levels where we know our model works very, very well. We believe that we’re doing those things that will make that happen. And so we think, I don't know about 10 years, but I think as you look over the next five years that we have a reasonable likelihood to perform in that area.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Ho from William Blair and Company. Please go ahead with your question.
Jonathan Ho: Just wanted to start out with maybe some thoughts around what you're seeing in the pipeline of opportunity for 2018 and just your general feel for the environment. And whether that is maybe having an impact in terms of your desire to make those additional investments?
Brian Miller: The pipeline and the markets behave very well. The deals are robust. And yes, we certainly believe that making these investments will be received well by a good marketplace that has the capacity to reward us for that. Having said that, we’ve invested through challenging times before. I mean some of the best investments we’ve made historically were during the 2009, 2010 weakness in the markets, because a lot of our competitors didn't and they looked it at the other way and said this is a soft market, why would we want to be investing at this level. And when we came out of that time, we experienced couple of very high double-digit growth years, catching up on the business that had been deferred. So I do think the market is strong right now and I do think we won't have to be patient to get a return on these investments. But really Tyler historically has invested in these products throughout up and down markets and I think that's worked well for us.
Jonathan Ho: And then just as a follow-up. Can you talk a little bit about the competitive landscape? And are you seeing any shifts there, particularly around the public safety markets?
Brian Miller: There aren't any significant shifts. We said in the prepared remarks, that's a good marketplace, there're strong competitors there. No markets are easy and I think sometimes when we achieve high market share, people think it might be a little less challenging than it is. There're certainly good competitors across the board in those marketplace. And while we get good results, we fight pretty hard to get them and nothing is to be taken for granted. Public safety though, I would say, what happened in tax, what happened in courts where we really became a dominant leader in a pretty short period of time, it's less likely to happen there in that shorter period of time. As we said, we believe Tyler has some unique advantages and we know we'll invest and execute over the long term. And ultimately, we'll be rewarded with a strong leadership position. But there's strong players in that place, and they're not just going to turn away. So I think this will be a long process to continue to improve our position in that marketplace.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Berg from Needham and Company. Please go ahead with your question.
Scott Berg: My question Brian is for you around cash flows. If you look at your operating cash flow margins, you're actually down a little bit year-over-year versus '16, and I think it's all working capital related. But does some of that kind of unwind here in '18, or will these be maybe slightly compressed from what we've historically seen?
Brian Miller: I think the factors that we pointed to earlier, the increase in the receivables much of that un-billed related to billings, milestone based billings on some large some large projects we have going on and the timing of those and the prepayment in taxes before we really knew what the level of option benefit we would get in Q4 was, both of those really turn around in 2018. And as we’ve also stated very much lower CapEx in 2018, roughly half the level they were this year. So I think the cash flow margins do improve in 2018.
Scott Berg: Then my follow up for you there, John or Lynn is, you guys can talk all year about the success you’ve had in public safety area, and plenty of questions asked about it today. But you guys enrolled a new theme run connected communities at our conference last year. And I’ve been enamored with it because I get the long term vision of how the products come together, I get the R&D investments and how that will drive that. But are customers understanding what that vision looks like, is that actually impacting a better win rates across your products last year.
John Marr: I think customers definitely do see the value in that. We certainly rolled that out at our user conferences. There is a lot of excitement around it. As we said before, it’s a long term process. I don’t know if that specifically isn’t impacted win rates to date. I do expect that it’s going to impact win rates going forward. Whether or not one jurisdiction and its neighboring jurisdiction and their options are between Tyler and other product, and we’re the next jurisdiction and the benefits of those two will bring, if they go with Tyler and they can be connected, both in public safety and then from their court system, that’s the value that we can bring that nobody else can. We're actively working on that. We talk about it. I don’t know that we’ve specifically seen that as driver in the win rates. I think the driver in our win rates really has been the focus we've done so far as we talked about in prepared comments of shoring up the customer references, doing things on the customer side, as John mentioned, to eliminate some of the churn, all the product investment, the new features and functionality. I think that coupled with the strength of Tyler behind it, the vision of Tyler alliance is, its creating excitement around public safety. And I do think that over the next few years, that’s going to help be the deciding factor in a number of deals that this Tyler alliance vision that you're also excited about.
Brian Miller: It’s also a always a number of things that affects a decision. So it will always be hard to isolate the primary reasons. So we certainly think that contributes to our position in the marketplace. But I would say tangibly what we’re seeing are a lot of multi Tyler suite applications, and a lot of the names that Lynn referred to in the remarks were multi suite applications, Munis and EnerGov, Munis and Muni-Court and then starting to see public safety and Odyssey deals. And no question, people see the incremental value to one Tyler application to another based on our more comprehensive vision.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brent Bracelin from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.
Brent Bracelin: Question I had was wanted to circle back to the subscription business. If I just look at revenue mix, its biggest one year increase in revenue mix from 19% to 20% of the mix now since 2014. I think it’s down 42% of software backlog. So as you think about that mix shift this year, is there a preference within local government where you’re starting to see this shift slowly increase more or is there a dynamic here where you’re including e-filing revenue in that subscription mix that just e-filing growth is the bigger factor driving a mix shift on that subscription side? And then I have one follow-up.
John Marr: It's definitely broader than e-filing. Munis this past year had a much higher mix, not only higher mix in names the average value of SaaS deals was up significantly. Though, it's pretty broad and it's crapped up into the higher size deals, that maybe the biggest change from previous years as the average deal size was significantly higher. So I think it's fair to say that it's not surprising, government is a little later to adopt this type of delivery than other industries. And I think it's moved for real. And in the stay, I'm not sure that it can get a little ahead of itself in the middle of this past year and maybe it’ll settle down a little bit before it accelerates again. But I think what we’ve expected a long-term gradual shift is exactly what we're experiencing.
Brent Bracelin: So there is still some volatility around the mix trends, but net-net it does sound like that large deal shift. It seems to be the biggest cut change you’re seeing now versus maybe a couple of years ago you weren’t seeing that. As a follow-up to that on the maintenance side, Brian, we saw maintenance growth slowed to 9% year-over-year. I think that's the lowest growth rate in maintenance since we've seen, and at the end of '13 early '14. What are the drivers there to reaccelerate maintenance? Are there some price increases you can flow through? Obviously, as you see the mix shift to subscription, you no longer get the incremental benefit of maintenance. So just trying to think about how we should level set the maintenance growth profile over the next couple of years in an environment where you are seeing a mix shift to cloud?
Brian Miller: Well, clearly that mix shift does affect the maintenance line. It's certainly more than offset on the subscription line, but it’s a combination of more of a new business coming in the cloud. And so again, more than on the subscription line and less new maintenance, as well as the flip to the conversions that we have, and those continue at a steady but pretty pace of the number of customers each quarter that are currently on-premises paying maintenance that move to our subscription model and move to the subscription line, typically at 2x what they were paying in maintenance. But it does have a negative effect on the maintenance line. So those two things together really what have slowed the maintenance growth. And I think again based on the current mix that 7.5% to 8% growth in maintenance is what you should expect. We do get annual maintenance increases so we work very hard to be very consistent with those and to provide significant value associated with those annual maintenance increases through our evergreen model. And that hasn’t really changed. So we're not seeing really a difference in the way where pricing maintenance increases and our attrition remains very, very low on the maintenance side. So no real changes there, it's really more just a mix of new businesses driving a lower maintenance growth.
Brent Bracelin: So as we think about maybe some downward pressure on the maintenance growth profile over the next few years maybe, the metric when you would look at and is maintenance plus subscription growth rate. I think you referenced that as what growing 14%. So it’s probably the better proxy to look at on a blended basis going forward.
Brian Miller: Yes I would say so. And we are -- I'd say, we’ve always able to add the numbers up. So we're pointing towards that metric and getting the annualized, referring to the annualized recurring revenues of those two combined is something you have to look at.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Schappel from Benchmark. Please go ahead with your question.
Mark Schappel: Brian, first question for you, I have another question on the product mix, in Q4. Was the shift to subscriptions, was this driven by just market preferences in your view, or were there some internal policy or sales incentives that were being offered?
Brian Miller: It's really market driven. Generally, sales reps are compensated very similarly for the same deal, whether it's a subscription or a license deal and our pricing structure has not changed, so we haven't really changed the pricing to try to drive new customers to one model or the other. I'd say that to the extent we are able to do that, we would have a preference towards the subscription model, but we do believe that in most cases, we have a fairly limited ability to push that new customer one way or other. So it's really primarily market driven.
Mark Schappel: And then John as a follow-up. Any update on the success you're having with respect to the relatively new online dispute resolution solution?
John Marr: Lynn is close that, I'll let him take that.
Lynn Moore: Mark, it's pretty small acquisition but it's an acquisition that we think has a lot of interest around the country. And we've already had significant interest in our client base. We’ve had a number of jurisdictions who have agreed to sign up for some pilot court systems. We've agreed to some pricing on that. I do think it's something that it does have excitement, like a lot of things that we do, it's going to take some time. It's going to take some time for those revenues to build and grow. But we're looking at something that could, as part of transforming the way justice is done, certainly at certain levels of justice. I think it's a new efficient way. And I think particularly some of our larger more progressive clients are ready to embrace this and roll it out. So it's going well, but like everything else, it's slow. I don't expect significant or meaningful revenues in the near term. But over the long term, like a lot of our growth initiatives, we expect that it's going to add significant revenues at a little higher rate and add incremental growth to Tyler.
Operator: Our next question comes from Peter Heckmann from D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead with your question.
Peter Heckmann: Brian, could you just give us a quick update, I know it's a small number. But Microsoft royalties recognized in revenue this year, and then any anticipation of a material change in that relationship in 2018?
Brian Miller: Revenues were relatively flat this year. And as we've seen, it's not really material number, but our total royalties for the year, not including our direct channel, were $3.7 million, last year they were $3.4 million, so not a big movement there. I think I'd like Lynn speak to the relationship and any changes there. Although, there haven't really been any significant lately.
Lynn Moore: No real significant change. Royalties, I think they’ve increased in the fourth quarter. Our relationship with Microsoft is still good. And I would say, there is no material change at this point.
Peter Heckmann: And then if we could maybe shift gears to the state wide deal for e-fillings. Congratulations on Kansas, looks like there is some others in the queue. Can you talk about how many dates have now made an award for an e-filling project, how many those has Tyler won, and the few cases where you’ve lost, whether there maybe some particular issue around technology or anything else that may have pushed decision away from Tyler.
John Marr: There is a lot of different categories there, so there’s not a short answer. There are mandatory state wide deals, those are obviously the ones that are fully up the scale and we can see there’s good visibility on the number, where they are click based or fixed contract based on click. And then there is others that is part of the contracts, but they’re not fully on line yet. But generally, our expectation is that all of our existing significant clients will have e-file and some of them will come up with mandatory and we’ll see the spike right off of that, and we like those obviously and some will take time as we have to drive adoption rates over that long term. I think we’ve really only lost one significant deal at that level, say in the last five years. So our position is very strong and you're going to occasionally lose a deal based on relationship or pricing, or things that we can’t change our model to, to embrace without jeopardizing our overall strategies. So very few losses and again only comes to mind that would have been significant.
Lynn Moore: And we ever a presence in e-filing in 16 states and I believe all but four of those are state wide, so some California, Georgia, Ohio, we do not have state wide, it’s a county-by-county presence we have there.
Peter Heckmann: And then just last follow up on e-filing. Do you see any increase in tendency or preference on the part of states or counties to move towards fixed fee rather than a transaction fees for e-filing?
John Marr: I guess so. We've seen a few of them, we've done it. So people know it’s an option. I would stress that you don’t want to over-emphasize the difference, because they’re just looking for better visibility and something we know the government have to budget and that’s what they looking for. So it really tough is just doing the math and putting the number to it that is within the mid range of what would occur. So we're a subscription based and pretty much a quick base organization on that and that’s our model. But if somebody says, hey look, we’ve got a lot of history here, we can see, we know the range, as this, lets negotiate something that’s fair to both sides, obviously, will be a good partner and do that. But we’ve seen more people take us up on that and it gives better visibility to client in the west.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Liu from B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead with your question.
Kevin Liu: Just a quick follow up to that last question. So for the deals that on e-file that you have seen move to more to fixed fee. Has that generally been with your annual terms fairly flattish relative to what you were doing on a quick basis or do you see any increase or decrease in that rate?
Brian Miller: Generally, very-very close unless their experience changes dramatically, it’s relatively flat. Now renewals are good for us, because we have a lot of cost brining up the initial engagements and while that's been recovered, so flat renewals are not necessarily a bad thing for us.
Kevin Liu: And then just one other question you talked about the research product you introduced last quarter. Any sense for how traction for that is building within the marketplace and what's been your experience in terms of how much of an uplift you think you can get from an e-file customer if they adopt that?
John Marr: I don’t think we have enough data points yet to point to where that uplift is going to go. We're still at the stage where we’re rolling this out and there is excitement in terms of, for example, Illinois, where we announced it in terms of being fully turned on and fully utilized. We haven't hit that yet. So that's something that we're going to watch overtime. And there is some interest and we've talked before about other states we’re interested in this product, and we think that it's a good driver. But we don’t have enough data points yet to give you more guidance on that.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Tim Klasell from Northland Securities. Please go ahead with your question.
Tyler Wood: How does the backlog duration look? And then going into 2018, will this be converting into revenue at a different rate than what we've seen previously? Thanks.
Brian Miller: As we've pointed out over the years, the percentage of our backlog -- although, our backlog continues to grow significantly. There is more and more long-term backlog in that number with more subscription arrangements, which are typically I think we said 5.8 years in duration and the new bookings this year, and the multiyear e-filing arrangements, all of those things and as well, some of the large software deals that are multiyear implementations. So that percentage of backlog to be delivered even if the dollars to be delivered in the next year coming out of backlog or larger the percentage is smaller. So at year-end, it's right at 52% of our backlog of that $1.1 billion is expected to be delivered in the next 12 months, and the balance to be delivered over as long as the next seven years in some cases. And that's come down over the last few years. So last year going into 2017, it was 61% of our backlog, log was expected to be delivered in the next 12 months. And so there is much more long-term visibility in the existing backlog.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Marr, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.
John Marr: Well, thank you, Jaime. And thank you all for joining us on the call today. If you do have any additional questions, feel free to reach-out to Brian, Lynn or myself. Have a great day.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that we’ll conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your lines.

Operator: Hello, and welcome to today's Tyler Technologies Third Quarter 2017 Conference Call. Your host for today's call is John Marr, Chairman and CEO of Tyler Technologies. [Operator Instructions]. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, October 26, 2017. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Marr. Please go ahead.
John Marr: Thank you, and welcome to our third quarter 2017 earnings call. With me on the call today, are Lynn Moore, our President; and Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like to Brian to give the safe harbor statement, next Lynn will have some preliminary medicaments, then Brian will review the details of our third quarter results and 2017 guidance. Then I'll have some final comments, and we'll take your questions. Brian?

Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Lynn?
Lynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. Tyler executed very well in the third quarter and delivered solid earnings that were in line with our expectations. Even as we experienced a high level of subscriptions in our new business mix, we achieved the highest quarterly non-GAAP operating margin in our history at 29.2%. Subscriptions was, once again, our fastest growing revenue line, up 22%. Within subscription revenues, e-filing revenues rose 26%, including our first revenues from research Illinois.  Going back to the beginning of 2010, our subscription revenues have grown more than 20% in 30 of the last 31 quarters. Total recurring revenue from maintenance and subscriptions grew 14% and comprised 64% of total revenue. Bookings for the quarter declined 8% on a digital comparison to the third quarter of 2016. Bookings in last year's third quarter included approximately $72 million from the 4-year extension of our e-filing contract with Texas.  Compared to bookings, excluding the Texas e-file renewal, bookings this quarter rose 24%. Our quarter-end backlog grew 12% to nearly $1.1 billion. Similar to the second quarter this year, our mix of new software contracts had a high proportion of subscription arrangements, with cloud contracts comprising about half of our new deal mix. The total contract value of new software subscription contracts signed in the quarter doubled in value from last year's third quarter.  Our largest new subscription deal signed in Q3 included Clayton County Schools in Georgia for our Munis ERP and ExecuTime solutions, valued at approximately $7.5 million; contract with Island and Independent for all Munis ERP solution, each valued at approximately $5 million; contracts with Tennessee, New Mexico and Summer County Schools in Tennessee for our Munis ERP solution, a multi-suite arrangements with New Mexico for our Munis ERP, EnerGov and Tyler instant manager solutions; and Kyle, Texas for our Incode ERP solution.  Significant on-premise licenses deals signed during the quarter, each with a total contract value of $1 million or more included multi-suite arrangements with Georgia for case management, Incode ERP and solutions; Dover Delaware for our Munis ERP, ExecuTime, EnerGov solutions along with appraisal services; County Georgia for Public Safety and solutions; and County North Carolina for our Munis ERP and EnerGov solutions. We also signed significant on-premises license deals for on Public Safety solutions with Kentucky and Burlington County New Jersey and licensed contracts for our Munis ERP solution with Washington, Odyssey Texas and Paris Louisiana.  I mentioned earlier that our subscription revenues for the third quarter included our first revenues from research Illinois, which is an extension of our e-filing solution. During the quarter, we signed an amendment with the administrative office of the Illinois Courts, a current state-wide e-filing customer, for our first research portal. Under the 4-year, $12 million contract, Tyler is providing a web-based portal that provides immediate and secure access to consolidate database of case information. The solution provides a simple, consistent way to view and obtain case records and documents from counties across the state. It integrates with multiple case manager systems to share that information and provides an efficient way for attorneys, judges and other constituents to access important case records and documents at any time and on any device.  The contract also gives us the ability to offer additional value-added features and services, and we expect to offer additional attorney services on a subscription or transaction fee basis in the future. We will look to expand our research offerings into other states where we provide e-filing solutions. Research and our online dispute resolution offering, both provide attractive, long-term opportunities for recurring revenue growth and margin expansion.  Finally, our bookings this quarter included extensions of our state-wide e-filing contracts with courts in Indiana and Minnesota, with Minnesota converting to a fixed fee arrangement.  Now I'd like to Brian to write more detail on the results for the quarter and our updated annual guidance for 2017.
Brian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2017. I'm going to provide some additional data on the quarter's performance and update our guidance for 2017 and then John will have some additional comments. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. These measures exclude write-downs of acquisition-related deferred revenue and acquired leases, share-based compensation expense, the employer portion of payroll taxes on employee-stock transactions and amortization of acquired intangibles. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. GAAP revenues for the third quarter were $214.1 million, up 10.1%. On a non-GAAP basis, revenues were $214.4 million, up 8.4%. Software license and royalties revenues were essentially flat as our new software contract mix had a high proportion of subscription deals for the second conservative quarter. Subscription revenues increased 21.6%. We added 94 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 15 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $42.5 million in total contract value.  In Q3 of last year, we added 50 new subscription-based arrangements and had 18 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $22.7 million in total contract value.  SaaS clients represented approximately 49% of our new software contracts in the quarter compared to 28% in the prior year quarter. This is the second consecutive quarter that the number of new SaaS deals was essentially a 50-50 split with traditional license deals.  SaaS contract value comprised 51% of the total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 29% in Q3 last year. The value-weighted average-term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 5.8 years compared to 5.6 years in last year's third quarter.  Transaction-based revenues from e-filing and online payments, which are included in subscriptions, increased 22.9% to $15.4 million from $12.5 million last year. That amount includes e-filing revenue of $11.9 million this quarter, up 25.8% over last year. Cash flow from operations was $92.8 million compared to $79.2 million last year, up 17.2%. Free cash flow, which is calculated as cash from operations less capital expenditures, was $85.2 million compared to $71.6 million.  Our CapEx for the quarter was $7.6 million, including $3.6 million related to real estate compared to total CapEx of $7.6 million in Q3 of last year. We ended the quarter with a $186.3 million in cash and investments and no outstanding debt. Day sales outstanding and accounts receivable was 87 days at both September 30, 2017 and 2016.  Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $1.1 billion, up 12.2%. Software-related backlog, which excludes backlog from appraisal services contracts, was $1 billion, a 14.2% increase. Backlog included $260.5 million of maintenance compared to $236.2 million a year ago. Subscription backlog was $419.1 million compared to $337.5 million last year and includes approximately $130 million related to 60 e-filing contracts.  Our bookings for the quarter, which are calculated from the change in backlog plus non-GAAP revenues, were approximately $246 million, a decrease of 7.5% from Q3 of 2016. We had a difficult comparison to last year's third quarter, which included the e-file Texas renewal of approximately $72 million. Excluding the e-file Texas renewal from Q3 of 2016, bookings grew 23.6%. We also saw a handful of deals push out of the third quarter because profits were delayed in areas affected by hurricanes, Harvey and Irma. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $932 million, a 10% increase.  Note that we have posted a spreadsheet detailing our quarterly bookings calculations on the Investor Relations section of our website at www. under the Financials and Annual Report tab. We signed 32 new contracts in the third quarter that included software licenses greater than $100,000, and those contracts had an average license of $381,000 compared to 58 new contracts with an average license value of $362,000 in the third quarter of 2016.  As noted earlier, significant increases in our clients choosing subscription arrangements versus on-promises license contract resulted in the decrease. Our revised guidance for the full year of 2017 is as follows. We currently expect 2017 GAAP revenues will be between $840 million and $848 million, and non-GAAP revenues will be between $841 million and $849 million. We expect 2017 GAAP diluted EPS will be approximately $3.46 to $3.52 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock option exercises on the GAAP effective tax rate under ASU 2016-09. We expect 2017 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be approximately $3.86 to $3.92.  For the year, estimated pretax noncash share-based compensation expenses is expected to be approximately $38 million. We expect R&D expense for the year will be approximately $48 million to $49 million. Fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between 39.3 million and 39.6 million shares. GAAP earnings per share assumes an estimated annual effective tax rate of 14% after discrete tax items and includes approximately $38 million of discrete tax benefits related to share-based compensation. We estimate the non-GAAP annual tax rate for 2017 to be approximately 35.0%. This rate was lowered from 35.5% to reflect the estimated benefit of the R&D tax credit not expected at the beginning of the year. Beginning in 2017, Tyler is adjusting its non-GAAP financial income using a tax rate equal to Tyler's annual estimated tax rate on non-GAAP income. This rate is based on Tyler's estimated annual GAAP income tax rate forecast, adjusted that account for items that excluded from GAAP income in calculating Tyler's non-GAAP income as well as significant nonrecurring tax adjustments. The non-GAAP tax rate used in future periods will be reviewed periodically to determine whether it remains appropriate in consideration of factors, including Tyler's periodic effective tax rate calculating in accordance with GAAP. Changes resulting from tax legislation, changes in the geographic mix of revenues and expenses and other factors deemed significant. We expect our total capital expenditures will be approximately $53 million to $55 million for the year, including approximately $24 million related to real estate. Approximately $16 million of our 2017 CapEx is related to our cloud business, which includes hosted SaaS solutions and e-filing, including assets to accommodate future growth.  Total depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $50 million, including approximately $36 million of amortization of intangibles. Now I'd to turn the call back over to John for his further comments.
John Marr: Thanks, Brian. This was another strong quarter for Tyler, and we're pleased that we met our earnings expectation with our highest quarterly non-GAAP operating margin ever. We achieved these results even while facing a revenue headwind from the second consecutive quarter, in which, we've had a high level of subscription contracts and our new contract mix. As we noted earlier, approximately half of our new software contracts this quarter, both in terms of the number of deals and the total contract value, were cloud-based subscription arrangements. The total contract value for new SaaS software contracts of $36 million was double that of last year's third quarter and included 8 new SaaS contracts valued at more than $1 million each. Although the increase in cloud sales over the last two quarters is a headwind to short-term revenue and earnings growth, these new cloud contracts will drive higher recurring revenues going forward. We're pleased that so many of our new clients are selecting Tyler's solutions, whether they choose to run on-premise or in the Tyler cloud. Our win rates and bookings remain good, reflecting an active market in a strong competitive position. There are variety of factors that influence an individual client's decision on whether to purchase a license and run on-premise or enter into subscription arrangements with us. And we believe that in most cases, we have a limited ability to direct that decision. We're certainly happy to win new clients regardless of which model they choose, and we clearly have the strength to manage any short-term pressures on revenues and earnings that come with a shift toward more subscription business.  While this is a second consecutive quarter with a meaningful shift in the mix of new business towards subscription, we do expect them mix to vary significantly from quarter to quarter. We're also pleased with the continued momentum in our subscription revenues from e-filing and other transaction-based offerings. We've continue to add new e-file clients and our extending our relationships with courts and attorneys by adding new capabilities and services such as research and online dispute resolution. We're gratified that our e-filing clients continue to renew and extend those arrangements often well before the expiration of the initial terms as Minnesota and Indiana have recently done.  As we've discussed previously, we are investing at a high level in product development initiatives, particularly respect to enhancing our public safety products to improve our competitiveness and broaden our addressable market. These projects continue to progress on-schedule, and the marketplace is reacting favorably to our vision for public safety in the Tyler Alliance.  Finally, our thoughts and best wishes for a speedy recovery are with more than 800 Tyler client sites that were affected by hurricanes, Harvey, Irma and Maria. I'd also like to express my appreciation to the many Tyler professionals who've gone the extra mile to support these clients.  Prior to each storm, our disaster recovery team proactively reached out to the 269 Tyler clients with contracted disaster recovery services that were in the path of a storm, including sites like independent school districts in Texas and the government of the United States Virgin Islands. Our teams continue to work with the affected clients to make sure they can continue to manage their critical business processes. Lynn and I have heard from a number of clients who complemented Tyler on our dedication and performance to these disasters in our performance in situations like these make Tyler a trusted partner for local governments.  Now I'll be happy to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Kirk Evercore ISI.
Stewart Materne: John, wanted to follow up on the last comment you made to serve on the split or the decisions of clients going either for SaaS or license, and I'm sure Brian has some thoughts on this. But I guess 2 questions around that. When you guys think about the lifetime value of the client, does it change if go SaaS? Meaning, are you gaining not only more revenue dollars, but more gross profit dollars over say, a 5 or 10-year period if they go with the license option? And then Brian for you. When you're contemplating guidance in the fourth quarter we think out to 2018, is 50% sort of the new baseline that you're going to use just to, I guess potentially be a little bit more, I guess conservative around that? I think understand I guess I'm just trying to get your thoughts on how you're thinking about integrating that into your guidance process?
John Marr: Sure. Well, we certainly think that the long-term value of our clients is very significant regardless of how they become a Tyler client. Our maintenance agreements are substantial in dollars and in probably the highest margin revenue that we have as a company. So maybe unlike some industries or companies, the delta between on-premise and cloud is probably narrower with us and again, in some other places. Given the attrition is incredibly low, that the annual dollar volumes pretty high and the incremental cost to support clients is not that significant. So long-term value of on-premise traditional clients is very high and certainly approaches cloud clients. There is short-term pressure obviously on revenues as was seen in the second half of this year, and that adoption seems to be higher. There is no question if revenues are higher going forward, the incremental revenues are mostly attributable to the cloud itself, our facilities and the people that manage those facilities and the investment on those. There are high capital investments in hosting these clients, in incremental headcounts to support those clients as well. So revenues are significantly higher after the initial engagement between 50% and 100% higher depending on the arrangement. The margins on the incremental revenue would be lower than on the base maintenance agreement because of those capital investments and the additional headcount. But the incremental value probably after say, the fourth year or so is greater for cloud customers.
Brian Miller: Yes, on your question regarding guidance. Certainly, in the short term, it's a little bit more of a specific identification buildup of that guidance. So as we look out over the next quarter, most of the deals are pretty far in the pipeline and fall either in the SaaS category or in the license category, and we know where that is. There are always some that decide pretty late in the process and even a handful that will select a Tyler very late in the quarter, but haven't decided yet, which model they're going to adopt the software under. So that kind of accounts for the range of revenues and earnings in the guidance. It's a little clear looking out to the next quarter than what it be for the year. And so that's why we start out the year with a fairly broad range. And I think that given our experience both -- with recent quarters and looking at the pipeline, we believe we'd expect a higher percentage of SaaS in next year's number, but our range of guidance will take that into account that underlying assumption, I would expect would have a higher percentage of SaaS in it.
Operator: Our next question will come from Ken Wong of Citigroup.
Kenneth Wong: May be to put a finer point on Kirk's question in terms of guidance in the subscription mix. I know that's can't be a fairly broad range, but should we expect kind of those deals that are on the going forward? You guys perhaps maybe put those in the cloud camp versus the perpetual camp? Just maybe help us kind of think through what you guys seeing there?
John Marr: I think that the deals that we don't know, which way they're going to go. Probably, we put a higher proportion of those in the cloud category given more recent experience. So I don't know that 50-50 is the new norm, but it's probably a little bit above where the norm will be. But, yes, we would expect that trend would continue towards more cloud business.
Kenneth Wong: And I guess..
Lynn Moore: And I think Ken, this is Lynn Moore. I think it's important to note too is that a lot of times, it's not so much on the they may got with an RFP. And throughout the process, its geared towards on-premise, and it's oftentimes not until the very last minute during contracting that decision is made. And I think to echo Brian's comment, I don't think 50-50 is something we will be the new norm. I do think over the last, if you sort of look at trend line over the last, I don't know few years, it's certainly is ticking up, but there will be variations quarter-to-quarter, but it does make it a little difficult for us to predict some of these deals.
Kenneth Wong: Got it. And then maybe a follow up on new world. You guys talked about being able to compete for kind of higher tier deal once you get some added functionality and kind of build-out capacity on that product. Are we still on track for for that to be a fiscal '18 type event in terms of getting all that capability into the product?
John Marr: It's a long process. So there is no kind of switch in terms of when all of a sudden we play in larger sites. The win rates have already elevated, which is pretty impressive that in the short period of time, both we've delivered. And I think the expectation and the credibility what's underdevelopment is already affecting decisions pretty significantly. The win rates are meaningfully elevated from where they were. And it will be a creep up more than splash into a new tier of sizes. So to answer to your question, yes, I would expect we'd have some deals that are in the higher range than what we would have had next year, but it won't be as if all of once we become a leader in that particular space that could be a multiyear process to achieve that.
Operator: Our next question will come from Brian Kinstlinger of Maxim Group.
Brian Kinstlinger: I wanted to dig into the Illinois contract just announced this morning. It seems like in the value to customers is pretty high and differentiates you from your peers. So what's the process now for selling this offering into other states? I know you're really talking to other state customers and the sales cycle look like? And then I have a 1 follow up?
Lynn Moore: Yes, Brian. I think one thing that's important to note about this research Illinois is that it's a new recurring revenue stream, both in delivering the portal itself, but also in attorney services. It's an investment that we've been making for some time. We talk a lot over the years about making discretionary investments either internal expensed R&D or new acquisitions. And this is one of those areas we're certainly happy to see start seeing the benefit. It was originally sort of constructed for the County by County states, which as you know, there is 10 County by County states throughout the country, but we are also seeing some interest in some of them more consolidated unified states. I think the value proposition for the unified states is not as high, but there is interest there. We are talking with some of the states right now, something that actively pursuing. It's a revenue stream that we're excited about. We look forward to. But just like as John mentioned in our Public Safety deals, you know the markets, you followed us for sometime, things takes some time, but it is something that we look to expand throughout other states where we have a presence.
Brian Kinstlinger: Great. And then my follow up. Is the $3 million price based on volume mix because is a price for what essentially is a portal or piece of software?
Lynn Moore: Yes. It's a fixed price. And it's really based on the size of the state and the volume of the e-filing. I don't want to go into more specifics there, but yes, it's just a fixed fee.
John Marr: And then there would be potentially additional -- the value-added services to attorneys would be on a transaction or a subscription kind of basis. So those would be more volume driven.
Operator: Our next question will come from Brent Bracelin of KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Brent Bracelin: Brian for you. I wanted to go back to the subscription model impact. Here are 2 specific questions. One is, as you think about the 2 segments, where subscription headwind would have an impact, it looks like software license revenue and software services are the 2 segments that were most impacted. I think that's 31% of the business. Is that the right way we should think about if a customer moves to subscription, those 2 segments will be impacted going forward? And then I have 1 follow up.
Brian Miller: Really, mostly just the license line. The services are really pretty much the same regardless of which model the customer implements under. In the past, we originally -- in the earlier days of the subscription model, a lot of clients bundled the services into the subscription arrangements, that now virtually all of them contract for the services separately and pay those as they incurred. So there is not really a difference between the 2 models on this services line. It's really just lower license revenues and higher subscription revenues.
Lynn Moore: And maintenance. So maintenance revenues are recognized in the first year to generally carved out of the license fee, but you would see a modest reduction in maintenance, a larger reduction in license fees and then an uptick in the recurring revenue on the subscription side.
Brent Bracelin: Completely make sense there. And then just as a follow up. Typically, as you kind of see these transitions from perpetual to kind of subscription, we also see a build up of a deferred revenue on the balance sheet. And looks like deferred revenue was actually down 2% sequentially. It was up only 3% year-over-year. Walk me through the components of the subscription revenue and potential buildup on the balance sheet? Why decline sequentially this quarter even with the mixed shift? And how should we kind of think about the components there of what would -- I would normally think would be a of deferred revenue?
John Marr: Yes, it's just seasonality. So by far, the largest renewal cycle for maintenance is June, July. They in June and pay in July usually. That's a big fiscal year calendar event for local government in most states in the country. So you get a huge renewal. That's a big spike in the deferred revenue and then you had 3 months runoff from that. So that's the sequential decline, but year-over-year you won't see that.
Brent Bracelin: Just more maintenance timing related of those renewals to do with subscription mix?
John Marr: Yes. Subscription renewals. Right. That's correct.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jonathan Ho with William Blair & Company.
Jonathan Ho: I just wanted to start out with a question around Harvey and Irma. Whether you could maybe give us a sense of the magnitude of the impact from some of the deals that were delayed there and perhaps the timing on when could be potentially recognized?
John Marr: Yes. It was a handful of deals, maybe a half a dozen or so in specific sites that we were pretty far in negotiations and would expect them to signed in Q3 3 and they pushed into Q4, really doesn't effect the year number. It's a little bit of an effect on Q3, and it's probably in the order of $5 million, $6 million of total contract value.
Jonathan Ho: Got it. And then on -- in terms of the SaaS headwind, I just wanted to maybe understand if you guys could give us some preliminary thoughts on how we should be thinking about 2018 revenue growth? I know you guys don't really give guidance on this early on, but may be that will be helpful for us just to understand how to think about that for next year?
John Marr: That will be the next call, Jonathan.
Brian Miller: Yes. We'll wait for the next call to give guidance for '18. There is never just because of the new year comes in, it doesn't all of a sudden indicate some big pivot and growth rates. We've talked about a number of different investments we're making to accelerate the growth rate. We're happy with the research Illinois ideal as an indication of the new revenue stream that was one of many investments we're making that we believe will accelerate that growth rate overtime. All of these are long-term processes, so that we'll have few of those things kick-in, at least modestly next year and hopefully contribute to a trend in that direction. But again, a new year won't bring any significant change in growth rates, but I think over the next several years, that the investments we're making and some of these acquisitions we've done that are more strategic of nature, we're convinced will contribute to an acceleration of the growth rate overtime.
Operator: Our next question will come from Tim Klasell with Northland Securities.
Timothy Klasell: First question. On the hurricane side. Clearly, that impacted a lot of your customers. And has that caused may be a more rapid change inside of what they're thinking maybe going to a SaaS-type delivery given the more robust back-office nature of having hosted? Are you seeing more of your customers think about going to SaaS faster because of that -- because of those events?
John Marr: I think it's too early to probably know that. There are literally still recovering obviously. I think your point makes sense that we have multiple cloud facilities. They have from one to the other. And I think the level of redundancy and availability that we can provide is elevated from what an individual site can do for itself. So we may see that, but I think it's certainly too early to know at this point in time. We do offer disaster recovery services to on-premise clients and that's what we referred to in the prepared remarks, where we've had a number of sites to disaster. We have their databases and their applications. We retrieve those regularly so that they are fresh, and we're to spend those up to rapidly and give them availability. And so we did have a number of those occur. So we do have services to make them or to provide them with higher availability. But I would agree that the availabilities is greater than cloud, and we may see that influence decisions, but it's too early to tell.
Timothy Klasell: Okay. Great, great. And then sort of related question. Your conversions from on-premise to SaaS have been occurring at a fairly steady rate recently. Is there anything that you would see that might change that to either elevated or to decrease it? And is it normally sort of continues to be a -- at the time of a big systems upgraded, any of that changing? And sort of for you Brian. If that were to accelerate, what would be that -- what would be the financial impact and you sort of walk us through that?
John Marr: I don't think there's a big change. It's been pretty steady. If there is a change, it might be a modest uptick. I don't see it declining. It is available in or Tyler offers the cloud basically on all of our enterprise apps now, whereas not too many years ago, it was on originally more Munis and some of the others. So the uptick could come from just more availability across our enterprise applications. So it would probably up some light, but I don't think you'd see a real significant shift there. But we've obviously still got a much larger on-promise customer base than cloud-base, and I think overtime that will happen. In terms of the catalyst for it, you're obviously with their applications when they switch over to the cloud, there is 2 major catalyst. One is our turnover or usually retirement, and leadership in the IT side that's been maintaining the system. We're now a trusted partner. And as they bring in new professionals, they want us to play a larger role and reduce that exposure. And the other catalyst would be often that it's time for a major investment in their hardware infrastructure, and they can minimize that and basically justify the higher spend with us by not having to basically reinvest in their own facility.
Brian Miller: And the financial impacts. What the new hosted or subscription rate is for previous on-premises customer certainly vary depending upon how they've been a customer. But typically, it's an uplift of anywhere from 50% to 100% over what they were paying in maintenance. So it's a significant increase in the revenues to us. But the customer would also find deep value in that given that they would have jobs that wouldn't have to fill or hardware they wouldn't have to replace. So it's a strong value proposition for both of us.
Operator: Our next question will come from Charlie Strauzer bit CJS Securities.
Charles Strauzer: Couple of questions for you. I one question and really on the newer offerings like the research portal and some of the e-filing's as well in the competitive environment that you're seeing there, the kind of different competitor that are going up against in those areas. And are you seeing more competitors coming into the marketplace given your success there?
Lynn Moore: Yes, Charlie. This is Lynn. I don't know the competitive landscape is changed significantly. I think too when you look at the research Illinois portal, that's a totally new offering. That's a new offering we going back couple of years had thought about, had invested in. You really need to have the strength and capability that we have with having our court systems in either in the state-wide deals or in the county by county as well as our e-filing system. So that to me is a little bit of a unique opportunity right now.
Charles Strauzer: Do you the proprietary advantage like the research portal given you said that you have the court system in place? Are you basically hosting all the data or the documents, or is a something that's a glaring software on top of existing infrastructure there?
John Marr: I think the competitive advantage is our competitive advantage throughout the entire courts sector and us being the trusted and preferred e-filing vendor and part of what we're trying to do with this like to all clients try to continue to drive more and more volume to maintain that competitive advantage. So that's not to say that aren't competitors out there that could potentially get into this market like everything else we keep our eyes out for that. But I think right now competitive advantages really our strength in entire offering.
Brian Miller: And what it enhances our offering and makes it that much more comprehensive. So we have a case management system and then we have the e-file. Could they use someone for something like research? Yes. But we already -- we don't have the partnership. We have access to the information, we certainly have an advantage. The online dispute resolution, which would be new to us as well. And as we can -- our objective is as we add, there are not just new revenue streams, there are incremental value and creative campaigns of relationship that our customers are going to look to as a good partner.
Operator: Our next question will come from Alex Zukin of Piper Jaffray.
Aleksandr Zukin: I have just a few. Maybe first for John or Lynn. Can you guys talk about the performance in the quarter versus your internal expectations for -- on a bookings basis? And particularly, what drove this strength if wasn't expectations in light of a couple of million business getting pushed out of the quarter due to the hurricane?
Lynn Moore: These quarters are fluid, and this is a quarter where the performance is good, late in a lot of these deals came in. SaaS deals do come with multiyear arrangements. So help elevate bookings in backlog. And so that mix drove that to some degree as well, but win rates remain elevated. They've improved in some of the areas that we're investing. And the volume of that was pretty good. And we expect that to continue in this quarter, RFP activity and win rates that we would project over those support this continuum.
Aleksandr Zukin: Got it. And you start -- I know you guys are cautioning us against this, but if you start drawing a trend line into the mix. The incremental mix of business going into subscription basis versus license or perpetual. Bigger picture question, over the next three years as -- while conversion activity may not change, if the net new customers coming in are coming in in the cloud modality, how does your financial profile either your margin CAGR or you margins or your earnings CAGR or your top line CAGR start to look or change over the next 3 to 5 years versus the previous 3 to 5 years if this is more of permanent mixed shift?
John Marr: I really think it's more a function of adding some lumpiness. And being a little light on revenue this quarter and then not occurring in next quarter. But I really don't think the top line growth rate over, say the next 3, 4, 5 years or margins will be significantly different. Obviously, if we are going to stay at that elevated level, there will be some lumpiness. And so the growth rate will be a little lighter in those quarter's. And then obviously, those new revenues -- those new elevated run rate revenues start to contribute and you benefit from the outside. But you're definitely not talking about more than say 100 or 200 basis points on the revenue side and then we talked earlier on the margin side, margins are pretty similar. License and maintenance margins pretty high. So it's hard for cloud revenues to exceed those. So I don't think there would be an impact on margins.
Brian Miller: And if you remember, license revenues are only 8%, 9% of our total revenues. We already are very heavy on the recurring revenues and have and more new recurring revenue streams there. So the impact on the short-term growth is still relatively modest.
Aleksandr Zukin: Got it. And then may be on Brian, you mentioned the CapEx investments for the incremental cloud capacity for fiscal '17, is there a way to get the sense of how we should with fiscal '18 just given this mixed shift?
Brian Miller: We did have some investments this year that were in our data centers and capability -- infrastructure capability around our cloud business that was to support future growth. So there was a little bit of investments sort of so ahead of growth. So we're working through our capital plans for next year, but I think generally those would -- those investments would grow in line with the revenue growth.
Aleksandr Zukin: Got it. And then last one from me on the research portal product. Is there anyway to quantify maybe the incremental TAM for this product if you were able to sell it all of your existing e-file customers? And is it possible we sold the dollar of e-file, how much of a dollar research would represent as incremental after that opportunity?
Brian Miller: Kevin, I think at this point, it's still new and emerging revenue stream. Like I said -- like we've talked about before, it's not just the portal itself, it's the opportunity also to offer some services directly to attorneys. The market still new. There's -- we talked customers certainly receptive. I do think the value proposition is -- will be different for the states that already have a unified system versus the County by County states. And so we're still looking at all of there.
Operator: Our next question will come from Kevin Liu of B. Riley and Co.
Kevin Liu: Just one question from him. As your more of your business shifted toward SaaS. Can you just talk about what sort of newer term that impact that has on your services business? And as you look kind of longer term, if you do the mix get towards this 50-50 type mix, would you expect that to kind of reduce the need for hiring on the consulting side going forward?
John Marr: Not really. The vast majority of the servicers are application related. Converting their systems, implementation, project management, training, those really don't change at all. There are obviously would be a small segment. Things they do from a system standpoint that we do in our facility. So there could be a modest shift from maybe the last 5% of the professional services we delivered to the site that we actually performed the data center as an internal function. But certainly, the vast majority of the services are related to the application. And we still need to convert their systems, train them, show them how to use those systems and support that process. And that doesn't change very dramatically based on where the system resides.
Kevin Liu: Got it. And just one quick follow up on kind of e-filing services or the research portal. Some of these newer attorneys services that you might offer, would those also subject to or more in the County by County states, or do you think it will apply pretty broadly across your entire Courts & Justice for e-filing basis?
Lynn Moore: No. I think they would apply in every state. These of services that would be marketed directly. I think there are states who have the -- who already have a unified system that still have an interest in this portal. And we have -- that would be something that would be tried to push toward throughout the entire client base.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question will come from at Pat with JMP.
Patrick Walravens: I was trying to asked a little bit about the software bookings. So question I've been getting not sure how to answer it. So they were down 6% in Q3, and I get there was a difficult comp of 41% last year. But in Q2, you grew booking 16% and you also had a difficult comp, right of 37% last year? So I'm just wondering how was this quarter different than last quarter?
John Marr: It really relates more towards the big deals. So what comes -- what big deals they were in the previous quarter. Last year's third quarter, on the software side had a bigger number of not megadeals, the deals in $1.5 million to $5 million range. Obviously, some of those came in SaaS model this year.
Patrick Walravens: And Q2 didn't have big deals of last year?
John Marr: Q2 of last year.
Patrick Walravens: Last year. Because that comp was almost as big, right? That was a 37% software bookings.
John Marr: Talking on the software side or total bookings because…
Patrick Walravens: Talking on the software side.
John Marr: I don't know of that top of my head what was the comp was in Q2 '16 after looking into little further.
Patrick Walravens: Okay. It was 37%, but -- okay. And then my second question is bigger picture, which is -- so right now, the cloud-based business that's all entirely hosted data centers, right?
John Marr: One of them is completely hosted in our own facility and one, facility managed it.
Patrick Walravens: Okay. So what are the prospects for using third-party clouds, obviously what are the prospects for using third party.
John Marr: Very active -- we watch it very closely, actively monitor what's available on those sites and what the cost are. Currently, we still feel that we provide greater value, more flexibility. We think our clients like the fact that everything from our support people, our software engineers and the people managing the host of facility are all integrated into one solution and that still drives value. We do certainly believe that overtime hosting facilities can become more generic and more of a commodity. And the potentially the kind of weather size could potentially deliver the same service at a lower value, and we won't be that when that point's reached. So again, we monitor very actively. And we continue to think at this point in time, that there are advantageous to us continuing to host those facilities, but we don't have some aversion to doing this at other facilities when that appropriate.
Operator: At this time, there appeared to be no more questions. Mr. Marr, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.
John Marr: Great. Well, thank you, and appreciate everybody joining us in the call today. If you do have any further questions, feel free to contact, Lynn Brian and myself and will be happy to work with you. Have a great day.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

Operator: Hello, and welcome to today's Tyler Technologies Second Quarter 2017 Conference Call. Your host for today's call is John Marr, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, July 27, 2017. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Marr. Please go ahead.
John Marr: Thank you, Will, and welcome to our second quarter 2017 earnings call. With me on the call today are Lynn Moore, our President; and Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like for Brian to give the safe harbor statement, next Lynn will have some preliminary comments and Brian will review the details of our second quarter results and 2017 guidance. Then I'll have some final comments and we'll take your questions. Brian?

Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Lynn?
Lynn Moore: Thanks Brian. Tyler performed at a high level in many respects in the second quarter and earnings were in line with our expectations. Total GAAP revenue growth was nearly 11%, all of which was organic, and non-GAAP revenue growth was just over 8%. Subscriptions was our fastest growing revenue line, up 21%. Total recurring revenue from maintenance and subscriptions grew 16% and comprised more than 62% of total revenue. Bookings for the quarter were strong, increasing 14%. For the first half of the year, bookings were up almost 18%. Our quarter-end backlog reaching new milestone at $1 billion, up 17% over last year's. Our largest contract for the quarter was a multi-suite deal with Cook County, Illinois for our Odyssey Court Case Manager and Brazos' e-Citation solutions valued at $36 million. Other significant multi-suite arrangements during the quarter included: SaaS contracts with Santa Fe, New Mexico for our Munis and EnerGov solutions; and Nampa, Idaho for our Munis, EnerGov, ExecuTime and Tyler Notify solutions; as well as a traditional license contract with Bartlesville, Oklahoma for our Munis and EnerGov solutions. We signed our 13th statewide Odyssey course contract with the state of Vermont. The deal is valued at over $6 million and includes e-filing under a transaction based arrangement. We also expanded our Odyssey footprint into 2 additional new states, with a SaaS contract for court case management with St. Tammany Parish in Louisiana and our first e-filing contract in the state of Alabama with Jefferson County. Notable new contracts for our New World Public Safety solution included: license arrangements with Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, Kendall County 911 in Illinois and Hamilton Township, New Jersey. We're pleased with the progress we've made with our competitive position in Public Safety. Through the first six months of 2017, we've added as many new clients for New World Public Safety as we did for the full-year of 2016. For our iasWorld Appraisal & Tax solution, notable contracts included: an $8 million SaaS arrangement with Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; as well as major SaaS contracts with Scott County, Minnesota; and the Massachusetts Office of Information Technology, as well as a traditional license contract with Augusta, Georgia. For our Munis ERP solution, we signed notable license contracts with: Berkeley, California; Harnett County, North Carolina; Kirkland, Washington and the Berkeley County school district in South Carolina. In addition, our Munis ERP solutions signed notable SaaS arrangements with Glendale, Arizona and Milford, Connecticut. For our EnerGov solution, major contracts included a license deal with Fort Myers, Florida and a SaaS agreement with New Hanover County, North Carolina. Now I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our updated annual guidance for 2017.
Brian Miller: Thanks Lynn. Yesterday Tyler Technologies reported its results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2017. I'm going to provide some additional data on the quarter's performance and update our guidance for 2017, then John will have some additional comments. In our earnings release, we've included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. These measures exclude write-downs of acquisition-related deferred revenue and acquired leases, share-based compensation expense, the employer portion of payroll taxes on employee-stock transactions and amortization of acquired intangibles. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. GAAP revenues for the second quarter were $209.1 million, up 10.7%, all of which was organic. On a non-GAAP basis, revenues were $209.4 million, up 8.1%. Software license and royalty revenues decreased 2.5%, as we saw a high level of SaaS deals signed in the current quarter bookings' mix. Subscription revenues increased 20.5%. We added 105 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 37 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $49.8 million in total contract value. In Q2 of last year, we added 74 new subscription-based arrangements and had 18 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $31.3 million in total contract value. SaaS clients represented approximately 51% of our software contracts in the quarter compared to 34% in the prior year quarter. This is the first time the number of new SaaS deals was greater than the number of traditional license deals. SaaS contract value comprised 39% of the total new software contract value signed this quarter, compared to 26% in Q2 last year. The value-weighted average-term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 5.2 years compared to 5.6 years in last year's second quarter. Transaction-based revenues from e-filing and online payments, which are included in subscriptions, increased 18.6% to $14 million from $11.8 million last year. That amount includes e-filing revenue of $10.6 million this quarter, up 18.8% over last year. Cash flow from operations was $1.4 million compared to $19.5 million last year. The decline is primarily due to the timing of payroll and income tax payments. This year, we had one more payday in Q2 than we did last year. Also last year, we had lower-cash-estimated tax payments in Q2, as we carried a large prepaid tax balance in 2016 from the prior year. Free cash flow, which is calculated as cash from operations less capital expenditures, was negative $8.9 million compared to $14.3 million in last year's second quarter. Our CapEx for the quarter was $10.3 million, including $4.7 million related to real estate, compared to total CapEx of $5.2 million in Q2 last year. We ended the quarter with a total of $92.6 million in cash and investments and no outstanding debt. Days sales outstanding and accounts receivables was 101 days at June 30, 2017, compared to 100 days of June 30, 2016. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $1 billion, up 17.3%. Software-related backlog, which excludes backlog from appraisal services contracts was $988.7 million, a 19.6% increase. Backlog included $266.7 million of maintenance compared to $235.1 million a year ago. Subscription backlog was $382.4 million compared to $258.9 million last year, and includes approximately $101 million related to fixed-fee e-filing contracts. Our bookings for the quarter, which are calculated from the change in backlog plus non-GAAP revenues, were approximately $288 million, an increase of 13.8% from Q2 of 2016. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $952 million, a 24.1% increase. Note that we've posted a spreadsheet, detailing our quarterly bookings calculations on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.tylertech.com/investors under the Financials and Annual report tab. We signed 25 new contracts in the second quarter that included software licenses greater than $100,000, and those contracts had an average license of $842,000, compared to 38 new contracts with an average license value of $573,000 in the second quarter of 2016. Our guidance for the full year of 2017 is unchanged from our previous guidance. We currently expect 2017 GAAP revenues will be between $844 million and $854 million, and our non-GAAP revenues will be between $845 million and $855 million. We expect 2017 GAAP diluted EPS will be approximately $3.26 to $3.34 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock option exercises on the GAAP effective tax rate under ASU 2016-09. We expect 2017 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be approximately $3.83 to $3.91. We expect that, as in most years, earnings will be stronger in the second half of the year than in the first half, with the greatest sequential increase in earnings coming from the second quarter to the third quarter. For the year, estimated pretax noncash share-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $37 million. We expect R&D expense for the year will be approximately $48 million to $50 million. Fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between 39 million and 40 million shares. GAAP earnings per share assumes an estimated annual effective tax rate of 20% after discrete tax items, it includes approximately $29 million of discrete tax benefits related to share-based compensation. We estimate the non-GAAP annual effective tax rate for 2017 to be approximately 35.5%. Beginning in 2017, Tyler is adjusting its non-GAAP financial income using a tax rate equal to Tyler's annual estimated tax rate on non-GAAP income. This rate is based on Tyler's estimated annual GAAP income tax rate forecast, adjusted to account for items excluded from GAAP income in calculating Tyler's non-GAAP income, as well as significant nonrecurring tax adjustments. The non-GAAP tax rate used in future periods will be reviewed annually to determine whether it remains appropriate in consideration of factors, including: Tyler's periodic effective tax calculated in accordance with GAAP, changes resulting from tax legislation, changes in the geographic mix of revenues and expenses and other factors deemed significant. We expect our total CapEx will be approximately $53 million to $55 million for the year, including approximately $24 million related to real estate. Approximately $16 million of our 2017 CapEx is related to our cloud business, which includes hosted SaaS solutions and e-filing, including assets to accommodate future growth. Total depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $50 million, including approximately $35 million of the amortization of acquired intangibles. Now I'd like to turn the call back to John for his further comments.
John Marr: Thanks Brian. The strength in our bookings again this quarter reflects, both an active local government software market and our competitive strength within that market. As we noted earlier, second quarter bookings rose 14% over last year. Bookings included the $36 million Odyssey Contract with Cook County, as well as the one other license contract and three SaaS contracts that were each valued at over $5 million. As we noted earlier, the business mix included an historical high level of new SaaS contracts. The total contract value for new SaaS contracts of $45 million was 45% greater than our previous high quarter. The contract mix put pressure on our recognized revenues and margins. And we're gratified that we were still able to achieve earnings in line with our expectations, and that our guidance for the full year is unchanged from that we issued in April. As we've discussed previously, we are investing at a high level in product development initiatives, including major projects that will enhance our Public Safety products and increase their addressable market. We're pleased with our progress on these projects. Some of the new features were included in releases this quarter, and we believe that these initiatives are beginning to affect decisions in the marketplace. Now we'll take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first questioner of today is going to be Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray.
Alex Zukin: I wanted to ask the first question, just can you talk about what drove some of that cloud deal strength in the quarter? And do you see this as a new trend that you feel you have start taking into greater account, when you do annual guidance at the beginning of the year? And then I have 1 follow-up.
John Marr: At this point it's probably anecdotal and hard to know if it's a shift or a trend. It's certainly certain significantly elevated from our historical run rates. As we have said, about 50% of the names compared to historically, or for a number of years now, in the 30%, 35% range and about 40% on the dollar. So it's a significant jump. Looking at the pipeline, it's somewhat elevated, but that's probably not going to be sustainable, we'll have to see over time. As you probably know, we don't really put a lot of bias in the way we market our products. So we offer most of our products, hosted as well as traditionally deployed, nonpremise. And we are happy to capture the clients either way. So this is a market-driven preference that we experienced in this quarter, but it's a little early to know if it's a big shift.
Alex Zukin: I guess John, just a follow-up on that question. Given there could be a greater ROI for your customers as they are able to take some of their on-premise spend away when they purchase a cloud solution from you. But you guys don't price it any differently. Is there then, room for you guys to think about different pricing structures and dynamics, if this trend does incrementally increase?
John Marr: You could, and I know a lot of companies do. We really have chosen not to and don't have plans to change that. Again, we just think the long-term value of a client, traditionally deployed or hosted, is significant enough that we're very happy to capture the new clients either way. And by showing preference towards one, you could be adding a little bit of the hurdle to the other. You want to remember that - a much higher percent than what we realize in terms of the mix, go out to bid for traditional on-premise solutions. A lot of our wins for hosted solutions, started with our fees for traditionally deployed, and as they went through the process and learned more about our cloud offering, they actually switched. In fact, it's not at all uncommon for someone to select Tyler in the procurement process and yet, not have decided if they're going to keep it at their site or put it in our facility and then make that decision subsequently. So again, our focus is on putting the software forward, our reference abilities forward, our presence in the marketplace - the Tyler brand - and we're happy to get the client either way.
Brian Miller: And Alex, this is Brian. Just to be clear, while we don't have a particular bias in how we sell it, there is a difference in the pricing between a traditional on-premises and the cloud model. And the cloud-model pricing does take into account our - the hosting component of that. So it is a different pricing model.
Alex Zukin: And Brian, may be just on that - sticking on that same point. Can you walk through maybe the implications to cash flow, when a customer does go with the cloud product in terms of the way that you bill, collect and how you see that flowing through this year?
Brian Miller: Sure. Well with the traditional on-premise license deal, we typically collect a bill, a significant portion of the license upfront and the rest of the license may be billed on various terms, either milestone-based or time-based. But there's a significant upfront collection on the license and then, the services are paid over the periods that the services are provided. And then there's a maintenance stream that's typically annually in advance and the revenue recognition maybe a little different there, in some cases it's percentage of completion accounting where that license revenue recognition is spread over an implementation period. In most deals, the license revenue recognition follows the billing under the current rev rec rules. In a SaaS deal, typically the payments are either annually or quarterly in advance. Most deals are, the whole contract amount is recognized and billed pro rata over the term of the agreement. Some clients pay their services separately and those are over the implementation period. So generally, the cash flow is much more front-end loaded on the license deal and with a smaller recurring fee and the subscription deal is spread pro rata over a - on an average of about 5 years today, but can be anywhere from 4 to as much as in some cases, 7 or 10 years. I don't think - I think the shift this quarter will affect cash flow a bit this year, if not terribly dramatic, but it'll have a few million dollar impact on our free cash flow this year, a bit on cash flow. And $200 million range is not going to be a sort of a game changing situation.
Operator: And the next questioner today is going to be Brian Kinstlinger with Maxim Group.
Brian Kinstlinger: On NWS, the increased number of customers, I think, is a clear evidence of the impact of the investments you're making, but I'm curious how long do you think it will be before NWS can move upstream and compete on larger deals effectively?
John Marr: That's a good question. I'd say that we're very pleased that we're already impacting win rates. And the difference between what they were and what they are is significant enough to attribute that, certainly, to the investments we're making. So we're pleased with that. But it's a good observation that we're still focused on, generally, the same addressable market that they have been traditionally and it would really be, kind of, Phase II of that, which is an important part of their growth strategy to broaden that addressable market including moving upstream. The full impact of these investments is a 2, 2.5 year process that we're, maybe, approaching the first year of right now. So again, it's probably another year to 18 months before we fully realize that. And that'll be a gradual ramp up, right? You'll win some deals. You'll install them. Some people want to see the product. Some people want to be able to go to a number of sites that are up and running, so they will be early adopters and then they will be a process before we're probably looked at as a regular contender in that marketplace. So I suspect, again, it's a ramp-up one year from now to three years from now.
Brian Kinstlinger: Follow-up, kind of a number of questions, kind of longer term thinking. I think you're putting about $6 million annually into the upgrades and you're almost entering your second year of that. What happens once those two years are done, the $12 million have been put in, are you going to reallocate those resources? Are you going to slow spending? Is it going to drop? We had a similar situation a while back with Dynamics, where there were some confusion about what would happen after those investments were made as well.
John Marr: Yes, well Dynamics would be an exception to my answer basically, which would be that, historically, when this project was planned, there is the option to redeploy or reduce headcount. My expectation would be and my experience would tell me that, that's probably not what will happen. Preferably, we'll get the impact that we're starting to see on win rates broadening the market presence and we'll be a bigger, busier company and we'll chose to keep those heads where they are and continue to invest. And our revenues will grow, certainly, at a much accelerated rate over our growth and R&D spend. So we'll effectively catch up with it. We'll see leverage in that. We'll benefit from that. But if we're successful, and we're capturing significant wins in the marketplace, I doubt we'll reduce headcount. I think it will just grow at a significantly lower rate than overall revenue growth.
Operator: And the next questioner is going to be Scott Berg with Needham & Company.
Scott Berg: I have got two quick ones. John, the first one is, maybe, it's for Brian. Just wanted to go back to the SaaS, the subscription mix for the quarter relative to your guidance 3 months ago. Was the SaaS mix in the second quarter in line with your expectation? Because you're maintaining guidance for the full year might suggest that, just want to kind of understand how you viewed the second quarter a few months ago?
Brian Miller: I'd say the mix is marginally more heavy this quarter towards SaaS then we would've probably included in our plan. Certainly, we make adjustments along the way. There're a lot of puts and takes. And as you see, we have historically done a pretty job of managing cost to keep in line with the revenues. But yes, I'd say that this is a higher level than we would have expected. And as John said, a lot of times, even in the current quarter, we have deals that we've been awarded that we're not sure which model they'll go with. So that's why we set a range at the beginning of the year on the revenue side that's fairly broad and, typically, narrow that as we get later in the year when there's a little more certainty around it. But I said, the mix is a little more heavy toward SaaS. And as a result, while we've kept the same revenue range for the year's guidance, I'd say as we sit here half way through the year, I'd expect, it would be challenging to hit the high end of that range, that we're - again, there's a lot of business to be won in the second half of the year. But I'd say, it would be a challenge to get to the top end of that range today.
Scott Berg: And then my follow-up would be around the Public Safety business in the quarter. Your win rates in Q1 were very high for that business relative to what they were last year. Wanted to see what you guys are seeing in trends in the second quarter, don't expect 71% win rates in the first quarter to be sustained in the second quarter, necessarily. But any commentary on what that business look like? And maybe what your pipeline strength looks like going into the second half of the year?
JohnMarr: They were very close in the second quarter to what they were in the first quarter. So win rates are very elevated now over a six-month period of time over what the previous run rates were. The pipeline is good. So those are definitely leading indicators, they don't convert to revenues overnight. And certainly, our investment in those products, and in the organization in general, it is not a significant contributor to margin and revenue and earnings growth but we certainly have confidence that, that will accelerate as these sites come online so probably next year.
Operator: And our next questioner of today is going to be Tim Klasell with Northland Securities.
Timothy Klasell: Just a quick follow-up on Scott's question. You've mentioned that might be a little hard to or challenging to hit the high end of guidance for the year. Is that just solely because of some of the shift towards SaaS or is there anything else out there we should be aware of that might be contributing to the challenges in hitting the high end of the guidance?
John Marr: I don't think SaaS, by itself, but the mix is responsible for everything in our numbers. No question, it's a very elevated adoption rate and certainly affects revenues and margins in the quarter and we'll see how it goes forward. It's certainly a meaningful part of the story. But no, it's not the whole thing. I think in some of our businesses that experienced very high growth rates over the last three years, namely Courts & Justice, there's a little bit of a digestion period going on, executing on those contracts, addressing certainly the success of those sites and the customer satisfaction. So there's a little opportunity cost to digesting those sites, investing in our relationships with those, in terms of opportunity cost, in terms of current revenues and earnings. All of these divisions have strong outlooks. Their pipelines look good. Their competitive positions look good and while there's a pause in some of the growth right now, that isn't mix-related. All of them have expectations for accelerated growth in the second half and into '18.
Timothy Klasell: And then from both you guys, maybe John, the - I hear the - in User Conference you dove a lot into creating, sort of call it the common look and feel across as much as of your product line as you can. And I'd certainly see how that can provide leverage over time. What sort of feedback are you getting from customers? Is that entering into the conversations yet of, sort of the future of where you're taking this and how you can leverage it? Or would that be a little bit too early to start hearing that feedback from the customers yet?
John Marr: Probably a little early. It's a vision, it's a commitment and an investment that's going on. There are some early deliverables that support and add credibility to the strategy, and customers are excited about that. If you were at the conference, you saw that, it was very well received. There's always a trick when you're in this process. What we have, that's deliverable, referenceable, we can take people to sites and show them is winning. That's a leader in the marketplace and so while we'll talk about this vision and the strategy and we're anxious to share the early deliverables to lend that credibility to it, you also want to remain focused on what you have that you can touch and feel and see today that wins. So it's a little of both. But it is early and I think, over the next couple of years as more and more of the evidence is deliverable, it'll play a bigger role in the decision process.
Operator: And the next questioner is going to be Brent Bracelin with KeyBanc.
Brent Bracelin: First for Brian here, is really on the guidance for the second half. Guidance does imply that you're going to see acceleration in growth. I guess the question here is, with not a lot of visibility into whether those awards are kind of perpetual or a SaaS cloud, but what's the confidence you can see in growth? What's baked into your assumption, relative to the second half acceleration relative to mix of kind of SaaS, do you expect it to stay the same, decline? Help us understand, in order to see an acceleration, what are you assuming on the mix side for subscription SaaS?
Brian Miller: Well, I'd say that the range of guidance is still fairly wide and that takes into account a wide range of SaaS cloud versus traditional mix. We expect that, that mix will fall within range but within the range on the margin is where there's a little less visibility. Certainly, we have a lot of visibility, there are a lot of deals in the pipeline that are very clearly going to be license deals or very clearly going to be SaaS deals. So I'd say we have a strong confidence as we - the same level of confidence that we normally do, going into the second half of the year in being within that range. But we have chosen not to narrow the range, at this point.
John Marr: The visibility on the growth is pretty clear. So a majority of the growth comes from maintenance and subscriptions. So those are highly visible and under contract. You have got growth, we've had good license sales. We've got growth from new customers. We've got increases. Our biggest renewals are right now, at the end of June and early July, so we get increases in those. And then the good SaaS sales over the last several quarters support that. So that's highly visible growth and I think the variance that could occur on new licenses is pretty narrow. So I think the visibility for the second half, which is set through our quarterly meetings is pretty strong. There's always some risk and there's always some upside. But I think we've got pretty good visibility on what'll occur in the second half.
Brent Bracelin: And then my second question is tied to just the composition of backlog. Clearly, backlog is growing faster than revenue and really wanted to understand is the mix of backlog by product changing much, or is it relatively balanced across ERP, Court & Justice, Public Safety? Any color, relative to as you look at the backlog versus the revenue mix today, is there a shift relative to those buckets?
Brian Miller: I don't think there's any fundamental shifts going on there. Courts & Justice, obviously, signed into some extent our Appraisal & Tax business on the software side, typically signed larger contracts that are executed over a number of quarters, in some cases a number of years. So there, backlog --the percentage of our total backlog that they make up typically is outsized related to their percentage of our revenues just because of the nature of their project. And then Courts & Justice also has the e-Filing backlog and we have several significant fixed price e-Filing arrangements including Texas, and Illinois and Indiana that are in the backlog as well. So to the extent that C&J has the larger projects, they have a bigger percentage. And then ERP, which is the biggest component of our revenues, has a similar sized backlog and their bookings have continued to grow at a nice pace and those 2 would be the pieces that make up the majority of the backlog.
Brent Bracelin: And my last question is really around the Modria acquisition. Could you walk through logic there, the hole that it fills, and as you think about when that could start to contribute to some new RFP award momentum?
Lynn Moore: Sure, Brent. This is Lynn Moore. As a management team, we're always looking for ways to find areas for incremental growth and I think this is one of the things - one of the investments that we do. We make some internal investments. We look at some acquisitions, some that are more mature than others. Some that are a little more early stage, and I think that Modria sort of fits that bill, more on the early stage. I think courts right now, they're very interested in a couple of things. They are interested in really streamlining their processes, particularly, the smaller courts. There's a lot of clogs and logjams going on. They're also very interested in expanding further their access to justice programs. So the online dispute resolution is something that we've gotten a lot of interest from our clients already. We have a number of courts who are interested in looking at some pilot programs. I'd say those things will be in the more, again, the smaller courts - traffic, family law, small claims, it's probably where that stuff will initially rollout. Those types of arrangements will eventually be similar to e-Filing, in that they will be transaction-based or fixed-fee. But as of right now, I wouldn't count on any meaningful revenues in the near term. It's, again, it's something that we've made an investment in. We believe it will drive some incremental revenue growth and margin growth down the road and some early traction in the market, but it's still been unproven right now.
Operator: And the next questioner is going to be Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.
Kirk Materne: First question is for Brian. Brian, just on - you've mentioned $200 million in operating cash flow this year and I know that's not necessarily a hard target, but it obviously infers some pretty steep acceleration in the back half of the year. Could you help us bridge how you get there? I know cash flow is always stronger in the second half of the year and maybe some of the working capital changes this quarter, reverse back in your favor. Could you just walk us through that or unpack that a little bit?
Brian Miller: Yes, sure. And typically what we see is our cash from operations - the vast majority of that in the second half. Last year, we had $192 million of cash from operations and about $130 million of that was in the second half of the year. And the biggest factor there is the timing of our maintenance billings. We have a particularly high maintenance renewal cycle that happens with customers on July 1, tied to a lot of customers' fiscal years. We build that in Q2 and collect that in Q3, which drives really outsized cash flow in Q3 and on into the fourth quarter. So we expect that trend to continue this year and we don't give guidance on cash flow. But - so that $200-plus million of cash from operations is just a directional number. But we also expect that a couple of the factors that I mentioned earlier in the second quarter, the timing of payroll that worked its way out over the course of the year as well as the timing of the tax payments, those will sort out over the year, depending on how our stock option exercise has fallen, what extent we'll be able to take those credits against our future estimated tax payments. But we expect both of those will smooth out over the course of the second half.
Kirk Materne: And then my second question is for John, just on the customers deciding to move or take on a SaaS deal with you all. I'm just kind of curious if there's any commonalities on that front, meaning there are those clients that had skill shortages or they needed a shift more towards an OpEx model versus a CapEx model. I was just wondering if there's any commonality, and if so, do you think that's going to start to - is that something that is sort of permanent in nature, meaning skill shortages across same local governments that are going to help this trend accelerate potentially in the near term. It sounds like you don't think there's anything - sort of that's going to make this persist, but I'm just curious on your thought there.
John Marr: Yes, I don't know that it'll persist at this level, but it does appear that there's a trend towards higher adoption of SaaS. So these are a few things, and I've said before, the catalyst to buy new software and the catalyst to go to cloud sometimes, they're 2 different things. And the timing of those aren't always aligned. So what you're pointing to is kind of a brain drain, which is significant. A lot of long tenured people on the IT side in local government reaching retirement, and as well as the capital investment and infrastructure. Those things drive conversion to the cloud. And we did 37 flips this quarter, which are our traditional clients that move to the cloud, and so that's being driven by that typically. And there seems to be more alignment of those needs along with software needs at the same time, which strives higher adoption. And again, whether that persists at this level or it's just marginally higher going forward, time will tell. The other thing that is driving certainly, the number and not so much the dollar, is a lot of our lower end solutions that may be traditionally weren't offered in a SaaS mode, are now. So far more of our solutions are SaaS and maybe even have benefits by maturing in the cloud and so that's driving higher adoption as well. And that's certainly why the number of accounts is higher, obviously, the dollars are more to attributable to Munis deals and courts deals and the higher ticket items that we sell.
Operator: And the next questioner is going to be Zach Cummins with B. Riley and Company.
Zach Cummins: So I guess, just kind of staying on the SaaS deals. Are they still typically smaller municipalities there choosing SaaS deployments or have you seen some of your larger counties begin to warm up to the idea of SaaS?
Brian Miller: That's a mixture. On average, I would say they're smaller than the average deal. And as John said, we have a number of our smaller clients that we're able to now with SaaS solutions, offer a cost effective model for them to acquire the same level of technologies that some of those larger customers have. So for example in California on courts, we have LA County as in on-primes deployment, the largest county in the country. But the smallest county in the state, Alpine County, which I think it has something like 1500 residents is a SaaS deployment, so they are able to obtain the same basic technology under a cost-effective and manageable model. This quarter, our biggest SaaS deal was with the city of Philadelphia. So a large customer choosing our property and tax - our Appraisal & Tax solution on the SaaS model, but certainly I think 60 of our new SaaS clients were less than $10,000-a-year kind of clients. So we're seeing more of the larger wins, but on average, it's still smaller than the average traditional client.
Zach Cummins: And about a week ago, you've announced the statewide deployment of Odyssey and e-Filing solutions in the state of Vermont. Do you have any other statewide deals that are currently in your pipeline?
Brian Miller: Yes. We don't typically talk about names of customers in the pipeline but there are I think at least 2 states that either formally have an RFP out or have done an RFI or kind of pre-RFP activities for our statewide court case management solutions.
Operator: Our next questioner is going to be Mark Schappel with Benchmark.
Mark Schappel: Just one question. John, I was wondering if you just comment on the level and the quality of the RFPs that you're seeing out there in the marketplace, more specifically, I was just curious if the RFP activity is still high, and that if you're still seeing larger RFPs than you have in the past?
John Marr: Yes, the volume is very healthy. So both, the short term and the mid-term, which would be through early next year and further out, those are all healthy numbers. So if our win rates continue, which we expect them to, then it certainly supports the guidance we have and the accelerated growth we're looking for in '18 and '19.
Operator: And the next questioner of today is going to be Patrick Walravens with JMP Securities.
Patrick Walravens: John, could I drill down just a little bit. You've mentioned spending some resources addressing success and customer satisfaction, can you just tell us a little bit more about that?
John Marr: Yes. When you have pretty high growth, that's certainly Courts have in, very high growth over a three-year period of time, there's always a digesting period following that. And some of those things are not necessarily part of the contract and certainly, Tyler's practice would always be to go back and work with those clients and then identify what's gone well and what needs attention and work with those clients. And there's always - there are always things that you just choose to do, in the interest of customer sat and success and in having the referenceability we're looking for to continue to win in those areas. So some of that investment is unbillable and some of it has - and comes at the expense of the opportunity cost of deploying those resources and billable revenue earning things. So you have some of that, it's very typical. It's the right thing to do, it's a good investment. And so that's a piece of some of the slower growth, or earnings, at this point.
Patrick Walravens: And then Brian, just sort of big picture for us here. So you had a strong bookings quarter. You guys feel good about the business, the RFPs are good. But now it's going to be harder to get to the high end of the range and the stock is down a little bit. So what metrics do you think that investors should be focused on to help see through the impact of this shift to subscription?
Brian Miller: Well, I think, you need to look at a longer period of time than just one quarter. As I've said, this isn't - a higher level of subscriptions is a good thing, a higher level of bookings in any - whichever method they come to us - in is a good thing. And we've had two strong booking quarters in a row. And the trailing 12 months is strong. We do have more larger deals that where that revenue is recognized over multiple years. We've got, again, the subscriptions that are recognized more slowly, but we'll come out of that backlog number and help accelerate revenue growth going forward. So I think you just need to look at the same metrics, but it's hard to isolate on one quarter and put sort of undue emphasis on what happened there. Still, as again, our look for the whole year really hasn't changed. The range - and I'm really talking more about revenues than earnings, when I talk about being challenging to reach the high end of the range. As I've said, we have cost levers and typically do a pretty good job of managing the cost to fit the revenues. So the challenge is more on the revenue side this year. But again, looking at the big picture, I think we feel good about the ability to accelerate that above the current level, as we move into the second half of the year and on into 2018.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question today is going to be a follow-up from Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray.
Alex Zukin: So just some clarifying questions. John, I guess the first one for you. I'm trying to understand, where did bookings land versus your expectations? Because your commentary about strong bookings seems a bit at odds with the commentary about the digestion period in the slower growth. So I'm trying to understand the cloud - the customers deciding to go with cloud shouldn't really - outside of the mix shift question, where did - did the digestion period factor into your outlook, at the beginning of the year or in the first quarter? Help us understand the puts and takes on that.
John Marr: Yes. Some of it's in the model and may be there's a little more of it going on than was in the model. Bookings in backlog will be affected and be elevated as a result of higher SaaS adoption. Those are multi-year arrangements. So more goes into backlog if the contract value is simply higher than in on-premise arrangement, where really it's just the initial engagement that goes into backlog. Multiyear maintenance arrangements are not - they don't exist contractually, so they don't go in. So that will raise the bookings in the backlog a little bit.
Brian Miller: Our guidance at the beginning of the year, which is unchanged, was for a range of revenue growth that was modestly below what we have historically done. So it's just sort of pause in growth, some of which maybe, marginally related to the SaaS shift this quarter. But it was more bigger picture, in terms of as we make investments in things like Public Safety and position that for higher growth going forward, digest some of the growth, the ultra-high growth we've seen in areas like Courts & Justice over the last couple of years. So that was built into our model at the beginning of the year, so this one quarter sort of higher level SaaS adoption is a relatively minor tweak to that.
Alex Zukin: And maybe, Brian, just as another clarifying question. I realize you don't guide to cash flow, but when - I think when I was asking my question, I was specifically asking about free cash flow. So I'm curious, is that $200 million number that you're referencing, is that a free cash flow number or an operating cash flow number?
Brian Miller: Well, I mean, I was referring to cash from operations being north of $200 million. I'm not any more specific than that. So we've said what our CapEx would be in low to mid-$50 million range. So it's a very general number and north of $200 million free cash flow - yes, we'll leave it at that. But I was talking about cash from operations. I didn't say how much north of $200 million.
Alex Zukin: And then just maybe a last follow-up. Given that pause in dynamics, does this give you more confidence at all, and I realize you are not - you have a range for this year, so you're not going to guide for next year. But maybe, just the confidence and the ability to accelerate growth, given the incremental higher bookings and visibility that you guys might have?
John Marr: Yes. I think the combination of the bookings in backlog accelerating, as you'd expect they would, ahead of revenues accelerating is encouraging. The wins and pipeline questions: pipeline is very healthy; win rates remain strong. We're broadening the breadth of the product organically in - as well as some of the acquisitions we've done in recent years. And all of those things together contribute to an accelerated growth rate, which I think we'll begin to see in the second half of the year. As I've said, we've pretty good visibility on that and I think that'll continue into '17 and '18. So if you look at Tyler's growth rate, our current growth rate in this year is below our historical line and you're going to have years below it and years above it. And all indications are that this is simply a growth year that's a little bit on the lower end of the rage, not at reset of the range. And that we would expect it to accelerate in the second half of the year and then, into the next couple of years that we have some visibility on.
Operator: At this time, there appear to be no more questions. Mr. Marr, I'll turn the call back over to you for your closing remarks.
John Marr: Okay. Thank you, Will, and thank you all for participating on the call today. If you do have any further questions, feel free to reach out to Brian, Lynn and myself. Have a great day. Thank you.
Operator: And the conference has now concluded. Thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

Operator: Welcome to the Tyler Technologies First Quarter 2017 Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions]. I'd now like to turn the conference over to John Marr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.
John Marr: Thank you, Claire and welcome to our first quarter 2017 earnings call. With me on the call today are Lynn Moore, our President; and Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First I'd like for Brian to give the safe harbor statement. Next, I'll have some preliminary comments. Brian will review the details of our first quarter results and 2017 guidance. Then, I'll have some final comments and we'll take your questions. Brian?
Brian Miller: Thanks, John. During the course of this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information, that may include projections concerning the company's future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. John?
John Marr: Thank you. We're pleased with our first quarter results which provided a solid start to 2017. Total GAAP revenue growth was 11%, all of which was organic and non-GAAP revenue growth was 8%. Recurring revenues from maintenance and subscriptions led the way with mid-teens growth and comprised almost 64% of total revenues. We're also pleased that we were able to expand our non-GAAP operating margin by 70 basis points, even as we invested at a high level in product development, all of which was expensed. Bookings for the quarter were quite robust with a 25% increase over last year's first quarter to $186 million. We continue to be encouraged by the progress we've made with our New World Public Safety solutions. Run rates are improving and we signed as many new-named clients for New World Public Safety in the first quarter of 2017 as we did through August of last year. Our Public Safety development projects are well underway and on schedule, with the first half of new features targeted for release later this spring. We're confident that these investments will improve our competitive position in public safety, while significantly expanding our addressable market. Our largest deal for the quarter was with the State of New York's Department of Taxation and Finance and the New York State Office of Information Technology Services for our iasWorld computer-assisted mass appraisal solution valued at over $20 million. We also continued to see an increase in the number of new multi-suite arrangements. The number of multi-suite contracts signed in the first quarter was more than double the number signed in last year's first quarter, including SaaS contracts with Anoka County, Minnesota for our iasWorld, Munis and Eagle Recorder solutions; New Kent County and schools in Virginia for our Munis and EnerGov solutions; and Murfreesboro, Tennessee for our Munis Financials and Incode Municipal Court solutions. We also signed multi-suite contracts in Clayton County, Georgia for our Munis and iasWorld solutions; in Orleans Parish, Louisiana for our New World Public Safety, New World ERP and software solutions. Notable new contracts for our Munis ERP solutions included license arrangements with Cobb County, Georgia; Clearwater, Florida; the Lee County, Florida Sheriff's Office; and SaaS arrangements with Athens County, Ohio and Cleveland County, Oklahoma. For our iasWorld Appraisal & Tax solution in addition to the New York State contract, other notable contracts included a SaaS arrangement with Crow Wing County, Minnesota and a license contract with Butler County, Pennsylvania. We also signed significant -- a significant agreement with Chandler Unified School District, Arizona's third-largest district, for our Infinite Visions solutions. Finally, significant contracts for our New World Public Safety solutions included Ulster County, New York; Berkeley, California; Muskingum County, Ohio; and Scranton, Pennsylvania. Now I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and update our annual guidance for 2017.
Brian Miller: Thanks, John. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. I'm going to provide some additional data on the quarter's performance and update our guidance for 2017 and then John will have some additional comments. In our earnings release, we've included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. These measures exclude write-downs of acquisition-related deferred revenue and acquired leases, share-based compensation expense, the employer portion of payroll taxes on employee stock on transactions and amortization of acquired intangibles. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. GAAP revenues for the first quarter were $199.5 million, up 11.3%, all of which was organic. On a non-GAAP basis, revenues were $199.9 million, up 8%. Software license and royalty revenues increased 8.1%. Subscription revenues increased 17.6%. We added 92 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 17 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $25.8 million in total contract value. In Q1 of last year, we added 65 new subscription-based arrangements and had 11 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $28.5 million in total contract value. SaaS clients represented approximately 45% of our software contracts in the quarter compared to 34% in the prior year quarter. SaaS contract value comprised 29% of the total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 43% in Q1 last year. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 5.3 years compared to 6.3 years in last year's first quarter. Transaction-based revenues from e-filing and online payments which are included in subscriptions, increased 16% to $13.8 million from $11.9 million last year. That amount includes e-filing revenue of $10.4 million this quarter, up 17.3% over last year. Cash flow from operations increased 16.6% to $48.2 million. Free cash flow which is calculated as cash from operations less capital expenditures, was $28.4 million compared to $24.6 million in last year's first quarter. Excluding real estate costs, free cash flow was $36.2 million. Our CapEx for the quarter of $19.8 million included $4.9 million related to the expansion of our Yarmouth, Maine office facility and $2.9 million for our new -- for a new office facility in Latham, New York. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 42,000 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $6.2 million or an average price of $147.30 per share. We ended the quarter with a total of $97.2 million in cash and investments and no outstanding debt. Day sales outstandings in accounts receivable were 74 days at March 31, 2017, compared to 69 days at March 31, 2016. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $939.2 million, up 16.1%. Software-related backlog which excludes backlog from appraisal services contracts was $904.6 million, an 18.5% increase. Backlog included $218.8 million of maintenance compared to $191.7 million a year ago. Subscription backlog was $368.2 million compared to $250.9 million last year and includes approximately $108 million related to fixed fee e-filing contracts. Our bookings for the quarter which are calculated from the change in backlog plus non-GAAP revenues, were approximately $186 million, an increase of 24.8% from Q1 of 2016. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $917 million, a 32.3% increase over the prior period. Note that we have posted a spreadsheet detailing our quarterly bookings calculations on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.tylertech.com/investors, under the Financials and Annual Report tab. We signed 36 new contracts in the first quarter that included software licenses greater than $100,000 and those contracts had an average license of $707,000, compared to 30 new contracts with an average license value of $323,000 in the first quarter of 2016. Our guidance for the full year of 2017 is substantially unchanged from our previous guidance. We currently expect 2017 GAAP revenues will be between $844 million and $854 million and non-GAAP revenues will be between $845 million and $855 million. We expect 2017 GAAP diluted EPS will be approximately $3.26 to $3.34 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock option exercises on the GAAP effective tax rate under ASU 2016-09. We expect 2017 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be approximately $3.83 to $3.91. We expect that as in most years, earnings will be stronger in the second half of the year than in the first half, with the greatest sequential increase in earnings coming from the second quarter to the third quarter.  For the year, estimated pretax noncash share-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $37 million. We expect R&D expense for the year will be approximately $48 million to $50 million. Fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between 39 million and 49 million shares. GAAP earnings per share assumes an estimated annual effective tax rate of 20% after discrete tax items and includes approximately $29 million of discrete tax benefits related to share-based compensation. We estimate the non-GAAP annual effective tax rate for 2017 to be approximately 35.5%. Beginning in 2017, Tyler is adjusting its non-GAAP financial income using a tax rate equal to Tyler's annual estimated tax rate on non-GAAP income. This rate is based on Tyler's estimated annual GAAP income tax forecast adjusted to account for items excluded from GAAP income in calculating Tyler's non-GAAP income as well as significant nonrecurring tax adjustments. The non-GAAP tax rate used in future periods will be reviewed annually to determine whether it remains appropriate in consideration of factors, including Tyler's periodic effective tax rate calculated in accordance with GAAP, changes resulting from tax legislation, changes in the geographic mix of revenue and expenses and other factors deemed significant. We expect our total capital expenditures will be approximately $53 million to $55 million for the year, including approximately $24 million related to real estate. Approximately $16 million of our 2017 CapEx is related to our cloud business which includes hosted SaaS solutions and e-filing, including assets to accommodate future growth. Total depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $50 million, including approximately $35 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to John for his further comments.
John Marr: Thank you, Brian. Our strong first quarter bookings reflect both an active [indiscernible] software market and our strong competitive position within that market. As we noted earlier, first quarter bookings rose almost 25% over last year. Bookings included the $20 million New York State Tax Appraisal software deal as well as 2 other license contracts and 1 SaaS contract, each valued at more than $5 million. We're also off to a good start with new business in Q2, as we signed a $36 million contract in early April with Cook County, Illinois, for our Odyssey Court Case Management Software along with our Brazos, electronic citation solutions. With the Cook County contract which is the largest software contract in the company's history, 7 of the 10 largest counties in the country are now Odyssey clients. As Brian detailed, our guidance for the full year is substantially unchanged from what we issued in February. We're also pleased that we expanded our non-GAAP operating margin as well as cash from operations, even as we invest at a very high level in research and development with an increase of 16.5%. We believe these investments will lead to increased win rates and could significantly expand our public safety addressable market and we expect these initiatives will begin to affect decisions by prospects in the coming quarters. Finally, we're looking forward to hosting 5,000 Tyler clients at Connect 2017, our annual user conference, being held May 7 through the 10th in San Antonio. At the conference which will be our largest ever by a wide margin, we will also host investors and analysts at a session on Monday, May 8 from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Central Time. In the investors' session, we will provide an update on our product development efforts as well as a deeper dive on our connected community strategy, including Tyler Alliance and TYLER NEXUS initiatives. If you're interested in attending Connect, please contact Brian Miller for more information. A live and archived webcast of the investors' session and the accompanying slide deck will also be posted to our Investor Relations section of our website. Now Claire, we'll take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Charlie Strauzer with CJS Securities.
Charles Strauzer: Just a quick question. John, maybe you could expand a little bit more and give some color on the pipeline, the RFP pipeline. You've had some nice wins recently. Just maybe some general commentary there. Maybe also some specific color for Australia and Microsoft in the pipeline as well.
John Marr: Sure, Charlie. I will take the general market question and let Lynn comment on the international business. The broader market probably was modestly more robust through the first quarter over the last few months than what we've seen previously. So it's healthy as it's been now, kind of since the recovery. But I would say the uptick in backlog is a result more of slightly more robust market and consistent competitive performance. Lynn, I'll let you comment on the Australian business.
Lynn Moore: Yes, sure. Charlie, this is Lynn Moore. Overall, Australia, as you know, we've got the Northern Territory contract and that implementation is going real well. We're expecting the first go-live for the first module to be in Q4. And our expectation is that Northern Territory will add other product suites, as the implementation unfolds. I think overall, our strategy in international is, we're going to take a very deliberate approach. We have a long term view, sort of like we do everything we do at Tyler. I think international opportunities could provide some meaningful revenues down the road, but I caution about expecting any significant revenues certainly in the near term.
Charles Strauzer: Great. And any commentary at all on the Microsoft initiatives?
John Marr: Not really anything new. It's kind of performing where it is. But -- no, nothing significant going on there.
Operator: The next question comes from Scott Berg with Needham. I'm sorry Scott, Needham has just left the call. We will now pass the floor to Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.
Kirk Materne: John, I was just wondering if you could comment a little bit more on the Public Safety business, in terms of the new developments that you guys are bringing to the market. Do you think that really does much in terms of changing the pace of potential RFPs out there? Or are these products really just about you guys taking your win rates up another notch? I assume you hope it's both, but as we think about the opportunity around that, is it that you guys can maybe start having people rethink the way they're sort of thinking about software in that space? Or is this more about your level of competitiveness in that particular market?
John Marr: Yes, that's a good question and it's an important part of our business now. And the answer is, definitely both. Probably the earliest impact will be to improve our competitive position and our win rates in the market that they have traditionally addressed. But as we mentioned in our comments, we're clearly focused as well on significantly expanding the addressable market. I would characterize their experience historically as kind of the below the top, say, 20% of the market, not that they didn't participate there from time-to-time, but maybe from 20% -- 20 percentile down to 60 percentile was where their solutions were most competitive. And we're doing -- this project clearly has focus on moving up and down to some degree with the product and strengthening the position in geography, where maybe traditionally, they weren't as strong. So it is a long term project and -- but when I say long term, it's not as if all the results are way down the road. They will be incrementally achieved over time. Again, the earliest improvement should be in win rates in the traditional markets. But clearly over the next, say 2, 3, years, we have an eye on expanding the addressable market that they participate in. And then the third part really is also when we talk about NEXUS and Alliance and these Tyler initiatives is to also leverage and take advantage of the fact that we're a very strong leader on the court side of the business and in other parts of the market that are very related to Public Safety. So you could kind of look at it as those 3 different things, improving the traditional market, expanding the addressable market and leveraging the Tyler relationships and the presence we already have in the marketplace with other products.
Kirk Materne: Great. And then just one quick one for Brian. Brian, I realize it's perhaps a little bit early, but just any thoughts on FASB 606 that we should think about with you all as we think ahead. I know it's another year before you guys have to implement this or I guess 6 months. Anything we should think about just in terms of the makeup of term deals that you guys have? Or anything that might be impacted at a high level? I'm just trying to get a sense on where you maybe see some moving parts.
Brian Miller: Sure. We're still working through that. We're well under way with the implementation. We expect to implement it at the beginning of 2018 and do the full retrospect of adoption, so that '16 and '17 will also be restated and conformed to 606.  We have expanded the disclosure regarding the impact in our 10-Q as well. So I'd refer people to that as well for more details and that will continue to expand as we move through the year. I think on the traditional license deals, the biggest impact is likely to be to accelerate revenue recognition somewhat from the way we do it today, where it won't be tied as much to billings and milestones for part of that license that the license would be fully recognized from the softwares delivered, so that would accelerate a bit of revenue. On the SaaS business, don't expect a significant change there. Percentage of completion basis, there may be also some segmentation of those contracts that would potentially accelerate part of the revenue recognition, still working through what that impact will be. And then lastly, the commissions expense and -- which we defer over the -- basically, the implementation period today. There's some indication that, that would likely be amortized over a longer period of time. That's still a little unclear about the practical application of that and we're still working through that.
Kirk Materne: Okay. I realize you've got some time to tighten it all down over the next 6 months, but I appreciate the color.
Operator: The next question comes from Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray.
Aleksandr Zukin: Maybe John, if you take the bookings commentary and you put that against the current guidance, can you maybe talk about the puts and takes on how you think this booking strength can either translate into either a top or bottom line upside in a year?
John Marr: I appreciate that the bookings were very strong. They were not guiding up. Some of the deals are very long term. As you know, larger deals tend to extend over years, rather than quarters. We're encouraged by the bookings. We're encouraged by the competitive position we're in and by the market activity. But the divisions reporting -- weren't reporting color that would cause us to raise guidance at this point in time. But in the long term, it's a positive leading indicator and these development efforts that we have and a lot of different projects we have going on in Tyler are clearly focused on getting the growth rate back to where it's been over the last 10 years or more and we expect to see that. But again, at this point, there wasn't enough strength to raise guidance.
Aleksandr Zukin: Got it. That's helpful. And then as you think about the spend on R&D this year to kind of upgrade the Public Safety product to bring it into larger deals than maybe New World had seen prior, should we expect that investment to kind of crest this year or is that a multiyear initiative at this point?
John Marr: I guess the answer is kind of both there. And, obviously, it will add heads over time as they do more business they'll need more resources to deliver on that business. But the core R&D, the way I would look at it is, kind of a need list that we've put together when we did the deal. We rolled a lot of that forward. So I would say we're -- we kind of have our R&D headcount 2 or 3 years ahead of where it would have been and we would expect that it's crested to some degree, but I caution that. Obviously, if there are very sound investments to be made, we will make them. But yes, we would expect that R&D spend and headcount would now grow at a considerably lower rate than their overall revenue growth rate and, therefore, margins will expand within that division. They were higher when we bought it. This is a conscious decision to make an investment and become a leader in a broader segment of the market than they have participated in historically. And we think that's the right thing to do with this investment.
Aleksandr Zukin: Got it. And maybe one for Brian. If you look at gross margins in the quarter, they were flat year-over-year, slightly down quarter-over quarter and you had a really, really strong, I think, hardware and other gross profit performance. Are we starting to run into any structural limitations to the expansion around the gross margin line, as you grow? Is that -- is the New World having an impact on this? Or is this -- can we see this continue to move up over the course of the year?
Brian Miller: No. We still expect that we have opportunity in gross margin, although our guidance has not really changed from the beginning of the year that we expect that on the gross margin line that we'll be flat to down slightly for the year and the -- on the operating margin, we'll be flat to up slightly. But the long term thesis is still the same that we expect that if we're in this low double-digit growth environment, that we would expect to average somewhere around 100 basis points a year of gross margin improvement and potentially, a little better than that on the operating line. And we expect that, that model holds true on an average basis over a longer period of time.
Aleksandr Zukin: And I guess, Brian, can you just remind us what's causing the gross margin to be maybe flat this year?
Brian Miller: Yes, I'd say some of it is investment in -- additional investments in some of the product development, a lot of it is on the R&D line, but some of it is in the cost of sales line and some of the investments we're making, particularly in New World, as John mentioned, their margin profile was significantly above our blended margin profile and we ratcheted that back a bit with other investments, not just product development investments but investments in their organization to organizationally support growth. And -- so some of those in the operating expense line pulled that down a bit.
Operator: The next question comes from Scott Berg with Needham.
Scott Berg: Can you guys hear me this time?
John Marr: Yes, we can.
Scott Berg: The two questions I have first, John, is on the Public Safety activity in the quarter. You commented that you'd signed as many deals in the first quarter as you did through August last year. Is that a function of pipeline activity being up significantly higher? I know it was up 75% year-to-date last year when you exited December. Or is it more of a combination of improved win rates because customers are seeing product?
John Marr: Probably more win rates. And obviously, there hasn't been a lot of delivery yet, but I think the Tyler story, genuine commitment to this product line, it's been 1.5 years now, they can see the headcount additions and the story we're telling out there. So it's just a little more energy around it. I would also say that these commitments, some of these heads, a lot of them are R&D, but some of them are quality as well. And open support tickets and defects and all of those things have dramatically improved since the acquisition and that's helped on the [indiscernible] side of the business as well.
Scott Berg: Got it. Then my last question is around your comments in the script, John, around the increase in the number of multiproduct deals that you're seeing right now. That's a trend that we've seen in the last couple of years, that's steadily ticking up, but you called it out which I find probably a little interesting there. But are you seeing a specific trend around those deals? Customers packaging, product A with product B, the different modules, probably in the ERP. I'm just trying to get a sense of what you're seeing there and how should we view that going forward? Is this going to be a consistent trend?
John Marr: We hope so and we hope that Tyler plays a big role in causing it to be a consistent trend. Kind of getting away from the quarter and taking a step back and looking at the bigger picture, really in the last 15 years, as you know, we've acquired, we've built products and we've made -- we're in a position where we have a number of individual products that are in very strong leadership positions in this marketplace. But to this point, the level of integration in incremental value add across our different products hasn't been that significant. And we haven't missed that opportunity. We've recognized the significant effort to become a leader in those different areas. We're now really transitioning into-- when we're talking about Alliance and NEXUS, that you'll hear us talk more about as we go forward-- we're entering into the chapter where these products grow much more aggressively together. They kind of Tylerize, if you want to look at it that way and then we add an incremental level of value that otherwise isn't available. Because there really isn't another company that has such a broad range of products. And that's a big part of what Tyler's focused on in the coming years. Also upgrading which might have been just suite applications tucked in, into leadership application, that's a lot of where this R&D spend goes and that will even broaden the addressable market more.  So that instead of just selling a core case management system or a core financial system, that we have those ancillary products around it that add to the size of the deal, allow us to go back and sell into these. So it's really a big part of our comprehensive strategy over the next chapter of the business.
Operator: The next question comes from Tim Klasell with Northland Securities.
Timothy Klasell: A couple of quick questions. So first, a follow-on from Scott's question around New World software and the comparison of this quarter versus the first 10 months of last year. How much of that is, do you think, sustainable? And how much of that was -- obviously, you had some challenges integrating New World software at the beginning. How should we think about this going forward with the new products, the new architecture and the new investments, how can we sort of think about this as far as sort of organic steady-state growth going forward?
John Marr: It was through August, so it's 8 months. But some of it's a soft comp. Right after the acquisition, some softness there both in the market and our competitive position at the time. But it's encouraging, obviously, to see that change rather dramatically. In terms of sustainability, we're encouraged by this as we've said. We're excited about it. We think that having a strong Public Safety application as part of our whole Alliance integrated community, criminal justice area is a big deal for Tyler over the long run. It will be a long process. To grow into the addressable market that we believe is out there for us and to get to the win rates that we're looking at, could be a 4-year process, say. And so I don't want people to be -- set the bar too high. I think we will see incremental results really in quarters not far down the road. But, again, achieving all of that is a long term process.
Timothy Klasell: Okay. Great. And my second one is, this is the second large deal in as many years with Cook County in Illinois. Granted that's a very large county, but are you beginning to see some sales synergies? I know you often have to attack 1 silo or 1 group at a time in a lot of these entities and was that add-on sale sort of synergistic with your prior sale or should we sort of consider all of these as a little bit independent of each other?
John Marr: Well, long term we do, as we've been discussing, want to add this value across different apps and make it in any jurisdiction's interest to add Tyler applications when they're already a customer. I think in this case, other than kind of brand awareness and reputation and the leadership position that we -- we don't have to start off explaining who Tyler is. But other than that, I'd call these independent deals.
Operator: The next question comes from Jonathan Ho with William Blair & Company.
Jonathan Ho: I just wanted to start out with your thoughts around sort of the win rates in the courts area, now that you've picked up both Cook County and Maine. I just wanted to understand, clearly there isn't a negative impact there from your ability to win court cases, but with sort of the understanding that people are doing their due diligence and they are sort of seeing some of the challenges in some of the implementations out there. Are you actually seeing the customers now maybe delay the process at all or at least go through that process and understand more on the implementation side what needs to be done and therefore, that potentially could help you succeed in terms of implementations going forward?
John Marr: I don't know if I'd call it delay, but you can add a step in the process. And we've been incredibly fortunate that, especially with courts, we really haven't had any projects that cut off the rail to much of a degree. And I would call that atypical. In the software industry, most companies, even if they perform at an exceptional level, be the challenging implementations, very complex and it's not at all unusual, that even very well-performing companies will have challenging sites that they have to address. And so we like not having any. We've had a long run, in all honesty where we haven't had any. And we've got a few sites that have some challenges and we feel we're performing well on those sites, but the challenges exist. And we're there as a partner to address those. So again, I wouldn't call them full-blown delays. But sure, they ask about it, we respond. And so it adds a step in the process and it may cause some delay, but not like they put the project on the back burner. In terms of it being something they ought to be aware of and take their implementations seriously. Yes, that is true. Maine, I'm in Maine as many of you know and close to that project and they were already a site that was doing their share of due diligence, very thorough process. But they are aware of this and I think it probably does draw some incremental focus by making sure that they've taken every step they can to be committed to the project, executive sponsorship and fully staffed. And so -- I think most of the sites do this anyways, but sure, it adds some incremental focus to it.
Jonathan Ho: Great. And then just relative to the e-filing on business, can you talk a little bit maybe what systems might be coming online over the course of the next few quarters? And maybe how we should think about revenue growth in that business?
Brian Miller: Sure. I can talk about that. We've talked about growth in the mid-teens in e-filing this year, in that we expect that growth rate in e-filing to pick up somewhat in 2018, 2019. We have pretty long visibility on some of these projects that are either already committed to us, as a number of California counties are, but won't start e-filing until the underlying case management system is live and other places that are doing e-filing on a permissive basis that will move to mandatory at some point and increase the volume and the revenues. Sometimes these timelines are a bit fuzzy. But the general expectation is for mid-teens growth in e-filing this year. And we do have an acceleration in California, as we move through this year and the second half. But most of the growth in California which is obviously a big market, where we have a big presence, comes in '18, '19 and beyond. Illinois is a state that we signed a statewide agreement last year. That has some growth this year, but significant growth next year. The timing of Cook County joining that project which is obviously the biggest county in the state, is unclear at this point and we'll certainly be encouraging that -- to move as quickly as it can. Maine has an e-filing agreement that really will be an '18 event, I'm sorry, '18 and '19 event. So there are a number of those that will come online, but we have solid growth this year, but expect that to accelerate over the next couple of years. And we've talked about that coming close to doubling from the rate we exited 2016 at to the rate over the next, say, 3 to 5 years in the annual run rate to effectively double with that growth.
Operator: The next question comes from Brent Bracelin with Pacific Crest Securities.
Brent Bracelin: Starting with John, you highlighted improving win rates at New World this quarter, could you provide a little more color on what's driving the higher New World win rate? Is this tied to some of the internal things you've done there over the last year? Or would you say there's been a bit of a shift in the competitive landscape? I know there's been a lot of changes there as well.
John Marr: It's a whole range of things. Again, the product releases have not yet really contributed other than enthusiasm and, I think, credibility in the commitments that we're making that there is just more momentum around it in terms of where we're going and the deliverables that will come. I think as I mentioned earlier, that -- our existing customer base and the referenceability has improved. You've seen the investments Tyler is making. You've seen -- there are results there, in terms of quality and responsiveness and that's very helpful. And then I think, the guys around the unit would tell you, the sales execution itself. The messaging, the messaging within the division and around that product strategy, the messaging of the more comprehensive Tyler approach to criminal justice and even right down to product presentations which I think has been partly collaborating with the other Tyler divisions and sharing our own best practices. So it's a range of different things that are all operating at a higher level.
Brent Bracelin: Okay. Very helpful. And then one other follow up for you on kind of this multi-suite contracts. I mean you talked about that doubling. I guess, it's unclear for me, what areas you are seeing kind of the multi-suite wins in? Is this mostly kind of Courts & Justice bundled with Public Safety or is this other areas? And then the second part of that would be, are you seeing any change in local government purchasing patterns, where there is an appetite to do multisystem upgrades, now versus before?
John Marr: Sure. The multi-suites will normally be within the criminal justice area or within what we usually refer to as the enterprise side of the business. But there will be those and are those that cross the 2, but generally within those. The biggest change in purchasing practices is it's a little less of a rigid, formal process. The percentage of deals that actually don't go to RFP is significantly higher, say in the last 3 years. It started with smaller deals, but now it's even grown into the larger deals that there is a little more of, I guess, more just a pragmatic approach rather than a really structured approach. So it gives you an opportunity to shake the deal a little bit more. You go in and you're talking to people instead of responding to very specifically what's part of the deal and decisions shouldn't be made outside of those criteria and other applications often aren't added. I think they're a little more free-flowing and there's still very comprehensive processes on the pretermit side, but a little less formal, little more flexible and it gives them the opportunity to say, "Hey, we really like to add this SoftCode application to our case management project. That adds a lot of value," or "We want to add ExecuTime on the -- on our payroll and resources deal with Munis or something." So the RFPs I think are probably now down around half of the deals we do. And 5 years ago, probably would have been 80% or more.
Brent Bracelin: Interesting, that seems like that would play pretty well into your strength there. Last question from me is for Brian on the operating margins. I know Q1 has historically been kind of the low watermark here throughout margins, if I look back at the last kind of 5 years. But I know you're also investing more in Public Safety. So looking at that op margin of 27.2% this quarter, should we think about that as a low watermark this year that could continue to expand into the second half? Or are there specific R&D investments that might not -- we might not see as much upside to the margin expansion this year?
Brian Miller: I think it's kind of a first-half, second-half thing. So I think the first half -- and we talked about that a little bit in the comments on the guidance. I'd say the first couple of quarters look more similar to each other and then there is a step-up in the second half of the year in terms of the earnings R&D does step-up; it's not at its peak level yet, so we're still adding heads there. So that -- a number of those come on in Q2. So I think that puts a little pressure on Q2. We do expect revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of the year and earnings to grow with that. So it's really kind of a first-half, second-half thing. So I'd expect to see first half look -- second quarter look more similar to Q1 and then there to be a nice bump in the second half of the year.
Operator: Next question comes from Mark Schappel with Benchmark.
Mark Schappel: Most of my questions have been answered, but just one follow-up question on the multi-suite deals in the quarter here. John, you mentioned earlier that some of the product -- you mentioned some of the product integration work that you're doing in this area. I was wondering if you could just provide some additional color on some of the initiatives in the sales force to drive the broader deal sizes.
John Marr: Sure. We're -- from an R&D standpoint, we have Tyler-wide projects underway. We have oversight from the team that Jeff Green is leading to make sure everybody is implementing as much Tyler types of technology they can and adding levels of integration. The integration of the sales force that happens over a long period of time, the integration of all these organizations. We now have 2 groups, right? So we have criminal justice group with Courts & Justice and Public Safety and all that related applications and then we have the enterprise group. And the leadership in those areas came up through those divisions and they think comprehensively. They see the whole market as a single market and they drive those sales forces that way. That said, you will always have some distinct Tyler sales channels. The skills involved in selling the State of New York an appraisal system and the skills involved in selling a criminal justice system versus a financial system are different. So where through acquisitions, we probably have acquired 30 sales channels over the years, we really get down to maybe 3 or 4 different skill sets. So that's a tremendous amount of integration, but it really will be skills dependent and what the domain expertise needs to be in those different marketplaces. But you take what was the Munis sales channel on the enterprise side now. They are selling all kinds of different applications from acquisitions and organic builds that we've done over the last 10 years.
Operator: The next question comes from Kevin Liu with B. Riley & Co.
Kevin Liu: Just a question on the large deal pipeline. Seems like you guys have closed quite a few of them earlier on this year, especially relative to last year. Is that something you expect to continue in the second half, just given the state of the pipeline? Or is it just more a function of timing with these deals up for grabs early in '17?
Brian Miller: I'd say it's more of the latter, the timing. For this specific year, the timing has fallen with 2 large deals in the first half of the year. I'd say the pipeline has a good -- the longer term pipeline has a good mix and an increasing mix of larger deals and we've continued, obviously, to build our presence there, particularly in the courts and the property tax areas. But continuing to win larger deals in the ERP side and moving in that direction in Public Safety. But as we look at the pipeline for this year, I'd say these are the 2 biggest deals of the year have happened in the first half.
Kevin Liu: Got it. And then just similarly, on the SaaS side of things, seemed like there was kind of an elevated number of transactions also a more favorable mix towards SaaS this time around. Do you expect that to revert back to kind of what you've seen historically? Or are we starting to see more local governments just opt for the SaaS version of your products?
Brian Miller: I think over the long run, we expect it to continue to shift more towards SaaS. When you look at the number of SaaS deals, I would say there is a large number of relatively small SaaS deals that have happened in the last couple of quarters, particularly with the new product we have at Versatrans, on the school business transportation side, doing a lot of SaaS business, but with relatively small individual deal sizes. And I think that if you look at the number of SaaS deals that skews it a bit. But we expect that we'll continue to see this gradual shift, but certainly it bounces around a lot from quarter-to quarter.
Operator: The next question comes from Brian Kinstlinger with Maxim Group.
Brian Kinstlinger: I'm wondering if you can highlight how long you think it will take the investments in NWS before you see stronger win rates that I think are the premise for those investments? And also when do think you will be able to move upstream with a stronger product and compete for larger jurisdictions?
John Marr: I think we've seen it, right? The first quarter we said win rates were better and as many deals as through August of last year and really that's not on tangible improvements on the product other than maybe quality. It's more on the momentum and the enthusiasm around, I think, the whole combination of the companies. We will have some deliveries this spring. I think that will be important for those that maybe like the messaging. But want to see some deliverables and results. That will initially, I think, probably only impact the market they've traditionally been strong in. I think it's reasonable to think that maybe a year from now, maybe a little sooner, you will see more deals on the high end of that historical range and maybe some deals that start to creep up that ladder a little bit. There certainly have been some encouraging exchanges between the channel and the marketplace and people have been enthused by what they see us doing. So we'd be pleased if the balance of this year, we continue to see some incremental improvement in the traditional market and we'd be pleased if, say, a year out, we start to see some more deals on the high end of the traditional size and start to see some deals upside that range and we think that's reasonable.
Brian Kinstlinger: Great. And then my follow up. If you look at the courts and criminal justice market, clearly you've dominated that for many years. Are there any new entrants in the market? Or is your competitive position really unchanged? Basically, I'm wondering is anyone making significant investment to try to compete with you in any of these markets?
John Marr: Not really. There are still fragmented segments of the market out there. And some of them make a cost-related decision -- but this really doesn't [indiscernible] is really a product across Tyler which is -- we look at every loss and we have losses. I think some people think our rate, we win almost everything. We don't. We certainly have losses in all segments of our business. What we really look carefully for is when there are trends, when we're having a number of losses for whatever reason. Somebody's got a release that jumped over ours. Somebody's got a better value proposition. And really across the company, there are no consistent themes on the losses that we're experiencing. There are all kind of very fragmented one-off types of losses.
Operator: The next question comes from Patrick Walravens with JMP Securities.
Mathew Spencer: This is Matt Spencer on for Patrick. I guess, how are you guys thinking about M&A in 2017?
John Marr: I guess, there's two parts to that answer. We're never just aggressively looking to do a deal. We're always opportunistic and I'd say our general impression of the market right now, like a lot of -- like the value of a lot of assets these days, are that they're pretty richly valued. So that's part of the focus you're seeing on the organic investment, that certain things we think would be important to add to our offering are just very richly valued in the marketplace and we feel an organic build that's done on the same platforms as our other products and comes out of the box Tylerized, if you will, makes sense. The second part of the answer would be, we're doing a lot of research and we have a number of folks, senior folks involved in really doing, what we call, comprehensive [indiscernible] study which is looking at every segment of the market where something contiguous could expand our addressable market and to the extent that can be acquired at a reasonable valuation, we'll be aggressive in those areas. So a little bit of a long-winded answer. In the current climate, again, we're doing a lot of research to see what we really think would qualify as the best investment for us. But the lack of a lot of M&A since New World is really just a function of the valuations in the marketplace.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back to John Marr for any closing statements.
John Marr: Okay. Thank you, Claire. And thank you, everybody, for joining us on the call today and your interest and your questions. If you do have any further questions, feel free to reach out to Lynn, Brian or myself. Have a great day.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Tyler Tech’s Fourth Quarter and Year End 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note, this is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Marr Jr., Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.
John Marr Jr.: Thank you, William, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2016 earnings call. With me on the call today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer; and Lynn Moore, Tyler’s President. First, I would like for Brian to give the Safe Harbor statement. Next, I’ll have some preliminary comments. Brian will review the details of our fourth quarter results and 2017 guidance. Then, we’ll have some final comments and take your questions. Brian?
Brian Miller: Thanks, John. During the course of this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information and they include projections concerning the Company’s future prospects, revenues, expenses, and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. John?
John Marr Jr.: We’re pleased with our results for the quarter, which provided a strong finish to 2016. Total GAAP revenue growth was 22%, of which approximately 12% was organic; and non-GAAP revenue growth was just over 20%. For the year, our earnings exceeded the upper end of our initial guidance, and we achieved exceptional margin improvement, even as we invested at a high level in product development initiatives. License and subscription revenues were particularly robust as licenses grew 38% of which 20% was organic, and subscriptions grew 23% of which 21% was organic. It was another good bookings quarter with 18% increase to $212 million. We continue to be pleased with the progress we’ve made with the integration of New World, both from an operational and a product perspective. Through the first full year, as a part of Tyler, the public safety market was good in the fourth quarter and our year-end public safety pipeline was up more than 70% from the beginning of the year. Our largest deal in the quarter was a statewide contract with the state of Maine for our Odyssey courts and justice solutions valued at approximately $17 million, including a multiyear maintenance agreement and a ten-year fixed fee arrangement. This represents our 12th statewide Odyssey arrangement and the first new statewide courts deal since the states of Idaho and Washington in third quarter of 2013. We also singed our first international agreement for Odyssey. The contract with the northern territory of Australia includes several applications from the Odyssey software suite. The project will implemented in phases but it’s expected to ultimately have a value of approximately US$4 million. While the northern territory covers approximately one-sixth of the Australian continent, its population is the smallest in the country’s eight states and territories, with only about 1% of the country’s population. We believe that there will be additional opportunities for us to grow internationally with Odyssey in Australia as well as in other countries in the coming years. We also signed a new contract for Odyssey in California with the State Bar of California, as well as contracts with Lowndes [ph] County, Georgia and Nueces, Texas. We continue to see increasing number of contracts which include multiple suites of Tyler products. Those signed during the fourth quarter included a seven-year SaaS arrangement with Naperville, Illinois for our MUNIS and EnerGov solutions valued at over $7 million. A contract with Portland, Maine, the state’s largest city for our MUNIS and EnerGov solutions and a contract with Fort Smith, Arkansas for our MUNIS, EnerGov and ExecuTime solutions. Other significant agreements from MUNIS included Long Beach, California; DeKalb County schools districts in Georgia; Lehigh County in Pennsylvania; Jacksonville Beach, Florida; and Spartanburg County, South Carolina. For our iasWorld appraisal and tax solution, notable contracts included a SaaS arrangement with the Orleans Parish Assessor’s Office in Louisiana, a traditional agreement with Columbia County, Georgia. We also signed significant new license contracts for our New World public safety solutions with the Delaware Department of Safety and Homeland Security; Monroe County 911; and Fayette County in Pennsylvania and the City of Chesapeake, Virginia. Now, I would like for Brain to provide more detail on the result for the quarter and provide our annual guidance for 2017.
Brian Miller: Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016. I’m going to provide some additional data on the quarter’s performance and provide our guidance for 2017, and then John will have some additional comments. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. These measures exclude write-downs of acquisition-related deferred revenue and acquired leases, share-based compensation expense, the employer portion of payroll taxes on employee stock transactions, amortization of acquired intangibles and the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, improvements to employee share-based payment accounting on our income tax provision. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. In Q4, we adopted ASU 2016-09, which addresses among other items the accounting for income taxes and cash flow presentation of share-based compensation. Under ASU 2016-09, excess tax benefits or tax deficiencies generated upon the settlement or exercise of stock awards are no longer recognized as additional paid-in capital but are instead recognized as an adjustment to income tax expense. This change in accounting for income taxes is effective on a prospective basis as of the beginning of 2016. Cash flows related to excess tax benefits are now required to be presented as an operating activity rather than a financing activity. we elected to apply the statement of cash flows guidance related to excess tax benefits presentation as an operating activity on a retrospective basis. This change in accounting had a significant impact on GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share as our annual effective tax rate for the year was approximately 15%, compared to approximately 38% prior to the adoption. This accounting change also adjusted the calculation of diluted shares, resulting in a higher diluted share count. Non-GAAP net income was not impacted by the change in tax expense. However, non-GAAP EPS was impacted by the change in the diluted share calculation. Without the change, our non-GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter would have been $0.91 and our non-GAAP EPS for the full year would have been $3.53. Please refer to the supplemental financial information schedule included in our earnings release for the detail of the reported and recast amounts for previous periods impacted by the adoption of this ASU. GAAP revenues for the fourth quarter were $193.3 million, up 21.6% with 12.1% organic growth. On a non-GAAP basis, revenues were $195.1 million, up 20.3%. Non-GAAP organic growth was 10.4%. For purposes of calculating organic growth, we considered half of Q4 revenues from New World to be organic. Software license and royalty revenues increased 38.4%. Organic license revenues increased 20.3%. Subscription revenues increased 23.2% with 21.4% organic growth. We added 61 new subscription-based arrangements and converted six existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $18.4 million in total contract value. In Q4 of last year, we added 33 new subscription-based arrangements and had nine on-premises conversions, representing approximately $32.4 million in total contract value. SaaS clients represented approximately 30% of our new software clients in the quarter compared to 22% in the prior year quarter. SaaS contract value comprised 19% of the total new contract value signed this quarter compared to 49% in Q4 of last year. The value-weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 5.6 years compared to 6.6 years in last year’s fourth quarter. Transaction-based revenues from e-filing and online payments, which are included in subscriptions, increased 12.7% to $12.7 million from $11.3 million last year. That amount includes the e-filing revenue of $9.6 million this quarter, up 12.1% over last year. Cash flow from operations declined approximately 3% to $51.8 million. Free cash flow, which is calculated as cash from operations less capital expenditures, was $43.6 million compared to $49.6 million in last year’s fourth quarter. Excluding real estate costs, free cash flow was $47.7 million. Our CapEx for the quarter of $8.2 million included $3.4 million related to the expansion of our Yarmouth, Maine office facility. In Q4, we repurchased approximately 125,000 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $18.2 million or an average of $146.02 per share. For the full year 2016, we repurchased approximately 882,000 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $112.7 million or an average of $127.75 per share. We ended the quarter with the total of $69.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments and $10 million of debt associated with our line of credit, for which we used $300 million to purchase New World Systems in November of 2015. Days sales outstanding and accounts receivable improved to 93 days at December 31, 2016 compared to 100 days at December 31, 2015. Our backlog at the end of the quarter reached a new high at $953.3 million, up 12.9%. Software-related backlog, which excludes backlog from appraisal services contracts, was $914.6 million, a 14.8% increase. Backlog included $242.7 million of maintenance, compared to $216.6 million a year ago. Subscription backlog was $364.1 million, compared to $242 million last year, and includes approximately $114 million related to fixed fee e-filing contracts. Our bookings for the quarter, which are calculated from the change in backlog plus non-GAAP revenues, were approximately $212 million, an increase of 18.4% from Q4 of 2015. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $880 million, a 31.9% increase over the prior period. Note that we have posted a spread sheet, detailing our quarterly booking calculations on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.tylertech.com/investors under the Financials and Annual Reports tab. That spread sheets has been updated to reflect the reclassification of New World’s opening backlog in Q4 of 2015. We signed 57 new contracts in the fourth quarter that included software licenses greater than $100,000, and those contracts had an average license of $406,000, compared to 30 new contracts with an average license value of $349,000 in the fourth quarter of 2015. Public safety accounted for eight of those contracts compared to six in last year’s fourth quarter. Our guidance for the full year of 2017 is as follows: We currently expect 2017 GAAP revenues will be between $844 million and $854 million, and non-GAAP revenues will be between $845 million and $855 million. We expect 2017 GAAP diluted EPS will be approximately $3.26 to $3.34 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock option exercises on the GAAP effective tax rate under ASU 2016-09. We expect 2017 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be approximately $3.83 to $3.91. For the year, estimated pretax non-cash share-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $37 million. We expect R&D expense for the year will be approximately $48 million to $50 million. Fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between 39 million and 40 million shares. The adoption of ASU 2016-09 increased our outstanding shares by approximately 1.3%, which lowers EPS by approximately $0.05. GAAP earnings per share assumes an effective tax rate of 20% after discrete tax items, and includes approximately $29 million of estimated discrete tax benefits related to share-based compensation. We estimate the non-GAAP annual effective tax rate for 2017 will be approximately 35.5%. Beginning in 2017, Tyler intends to adjust non-GAAP financial income using a tax rate equal to Tyler’s annual estimated tax rate on non-GAAP income. This rate is based on Tyler’s estimated annual GAAP income tax rate forecast, adjusted to account for items excluded from GAAP income in calculating Tyler’s non-GAAP income as well as significant non-recurring tax adjustments. The non-GAAP tax rate used in future periods will be reviewed annually to determine whether it remains appropriate in consideration of factors including Tyler’s periodic effective tax rates calculated in accordance of GAAP, changes in tax legislation, changes in the geographic mix of revenues and expenses, and other factors deemed significant. We expect our total capital expenditures will be approximately $52 million to $54 million for the year, including approximately $24 million related to real estate. Approximately $16 million of our 2017 CapEx is related to our cloud business, which includes hosted SaaS solutions and e-filing, including assets to accommodate future growth. Total depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $50 million, including approximately $35 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Now, I would like to turn the call back over to John for his further comments.
John Marr Jr.: Thank you, Brian. As we noted earlier, our earnings for the year exceeded our expectations with New World’s earnings contributing to our above plan performance. Activity in the local government software market continues to be good and our fourth quarter bookings reflect that. As we move into 2017, our guidance calls for organic growth in the 10% to 11% range. Our near to mid-term expectations are for growth in the 10% to 12% range. Although, there will likely be opportunities from time-to-time to exceed that target. And we expect to be well positioned to take advantage of those opportunities. In order to maintain or expand our growth rate on a bigger base, we are pursuing several growth drivers including investing in existing products that do not currently have leadership positions, expanding our available markets through internal development as well as acquisitions, and expanding into new geographies including disciplined international expansion. With our very strong cash flow, we are choosing to invest more aggressively in a number of product development initiatives. We have planned to add approximately 80 developers over the course of 2017 and will invest approximately $6 million more in R&D than we did in 2016. A significant part of those investments involves projects to enhance our public safety products in accordance with our long-term plan to significantly improve win rates and gain market share in that space. Among those efforts include accelerating development of advanced features and functionality and scaling our solution for larger clients. We believe these investments will expand our public safety addressable market by a factor of four times and lead to increased win rates. In addition, we are adding resources to our enterprise development group to accelerate a number of development projects including those we discussed at our Investor Day last May. Those include elements of our Tyler Foundation and user experience with platform services and next generation apps like Tyler identity, bill presentation and payment, and constituent portal. As you know, we have not capitalized any software development cost in recent years with all of the cost expensed to either cost of sales or R&D expense, depending on the nature of the project. Although our increased investment in product development will put some pressure on margins in 2017, we still expect to achieve modest margin expansion this year. We’ve also put in considerable effort over the last year on an extensive white space analysis of the public sector software space. We are evaluating our current product offering in adjacent spaces, identifying connections to our existing offerings, sizing the markets and looking at competitive landscapes. This analysis is an ongoing project and it will enable us to priorities strategic investments, shaping both our M&A strategy, as well as our internal development priorities. Now, we’ll take questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first questioner today is Brent Bracelin with Pacific Crest. Please go ahead.
Brent Bracelin: Thank you. My first question is really around the international kind of expansion; courts and justice win in Australia seems like a nice foothold. Can you walk us through the broader strategy on what markets you plan to go into internationally and how meaningful that could be relative to 2017 and 2018 as a growth driver?
Lynn Moore: Sure, Brent. This is Lynn Moore. Yes, as we reported, we signed Northern Territory in the fourth quarter; that’s a big step for us. It’s obviously our first strong hold sort of outside of North America. We are going to begin implementation in the first quarter. As we reported, it’s going to be phased implementation, and we’re hopeful that the first phase will go live, which will be the civil administrative tribunals, in the fourth quarter. As we said before, I think the Australian opportunity is roughly about the size of the Texas customer base. It’s very similar to United States in the sense that there are a lot of older legacy products that are running the courts there. There is no clear market leader. And we think we’re well positioned to capitalize on that market. We’re tracking a number of opportunities there right now. I think our primary focus too is really getting the Northern Territory up and running; that’s test stuff and it’s our first foray. And I think once we do that, we will certainly enhance our competitive position to capitalize on other opportunities throughout Australia. As we mentioned, we’re going to take a disciplined approach to international opportunities. And right now, we are sort of looking at Australia to be our first foothold for courts and justice.
Brent Bracelin: Perfect. And then, one quick follow-up for Brian, if I could, on the GAAP guide of 12% kind of revenue growth this year. What’s implied growth rate on the software license and software subscription side? That’s a business that has been growing faster than the corporate average. Should we expect that to grow kind of in the mid-teens here or what are you factoring into that GAAP guide of 12% relative to what the software contribution could be?
Brian Miller: Yes. I think if you kind of broadly look at it, licenses would probably be mid teens kind of growth. I think services, as we saw in Q4, was a little bit lighter and we certainly would like to keep services growth below our overall growth rate. I think we’re probably looking at more like mid single digits on services growth, maybe -- certainly in the single digit range. Subscriptions probably also fall down in the mid to upper teens. Maintenance would be in the 9% to 10% range. Appraisal services actually will -- as you know, that business is a cyclical business with appraisal cycles that come on different timing in different states, and this is a year, a bit of a down year for those cycles. So, we expect appraisal services will probably be down in the 5% to 6% range below 2016 revenues. And hardware and other, although it’s a small line with the growth in our Brazos technology business unit, we expect that services -- hardware would probably be up in the 30% range. So, probably those are the parameters around the revenue lines.
Operator: Our next questioner today is Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Alex Zukin: So, first congrats on the quarter. I wanted to ask, maybe first for you John. Deal push-outs, shadow backlog, these were issues that you guys confronted in 2016. I wanted to ask, how you saw them play out in the fourth quarter and then, what are the expectations for those in 2017?
John Marr Jr.: Help me on what do you mean by shadow backlog?
Alex Zukin: Well, when you push -- when there will be deals that were contracted by…
John Marr Jr.: Okay, yes. Sure. We’ve just noted we don’t provide the detail on that, because it can bounce around. But, we’ve just noted that the volume of unsigned awards has certainly been an elevated level and it continues to be that way. They do get converted, and we don’t have any experience of deals that are unsigned that are not being contracted eventually. But, the process itself, especially in larger deals can go on for some time. And again that elevated level continues and we’ll announce those deals as they get contracted. But, it does give us confidence and better visibility into the guidance we’re providing and the sustained level of growth we expect.
Alex Zukin: That’s helpful and then may be just one more. The assumption, Brian, for New World growth in 2017, how does that compare to what you did in 2016? And overall, maybe, can you just level set, how does that compare to your expectations when you acquired the company, the growth rate that you’re projecting for 2017 for New World?
Brian Miller: I think it’s generally in line with what we expected. This is a multiyear growth opportunity in the public safety market, which was the primary focus of the New World acquisition. And we expect that to play out over number of years. Looking at full year growth for New World in 2016 versus 2015, and 2015 obviously, most of the year was not a part of Tyler. So, there may be some differences in their accounting before being a part of Tyler. But, if you look at the numbers that were filed with last year’s pro formas, New World as a whole grew a little north of 7% in 2016 versus 2015. The public safety piece grew a little faster than that; the ERP piece grew slower than that as we sort of narrowed the market in which we sell the New World ERP solution. The plan for 2017, the guidance would include public safety growth generally around the overall Tyler growth level, maybe a point above it or so, but kind of the in line with the Tyler growth level. And we said that over time through -- as we talked about some of the development initiatives, the ability to start to cross sell more aggressively, realizing the benefits of the Tyler alliance with our courts and justice solution, we expect to both expand that growth through both, expanding the addressable market in the public safety space as well as improving our win rates, which today in public safety, it’s a pretty competitive market and our win rates, they are well below what we see in some of our other more mature Tyler products. So, we would expect that if you look over the next few years that growth rate will continue to accelerate. But, I’d say looking back for first 15 months, it’s been generally in line with what we expected, and we didn’t expect it to be an overnight sensation.
Alex Zukin: And maybe just sneaking one in on the margins. I think, John, you mentioned that there is some modest upside for margins in 2017 but then it is an investment year, particularly on the R&D side and the product modernization, expansion side. Where would the upside come from, particularly as you could realize some synergies, operational synergies with New World, what would be the drivers of upside on margins, potential drivers for upside for margins in 2017?
John Marr Jr.: Within the short run, meaning 2017, it’s just execution. And the management team has a record of doing that very well. So, it’s not unusual that throughout the year we achieve better margins than maybe in the plan. And there is a little bit of that allowed for in our guidance because the record again is pretty long now and happens. So, it’s generally managing headcount. These heads, services heads, R&D heads all of those are in the plan, but we will still be disciplined as we go through the year with turnover and filling the new heads and managing those costs. So, it’s just an execution thing that again the team does very well on and in generally we can rely on some good performance there. In the longer term, obviously, it’s more the model and leverage in the model. And we appreciate your patience. We are investing at a higher level than probably even we thought we would. And it’s just a result of opportunities we see that we think should be funded. And we think that three, four, five years from now, to have an even stronger leadership position in our core applications and to achieve leadership in some of the surrounding applications where maybe right now we are not there, it’s going to deliver greater value to the Company than taking those margin gains right now.
Operator: Our next questioner today is Scott Berg with Needham and Company. Please go ahead.
Scott Berg: One question and a follow-up, I guess. First question John is on the platform investment. A year ago, you called out investing, I believe it was an incremental $15 million in the platform to try to help bring some of the technologies together, and that’s a longer term thesis. And you see more aggressive on this call in terms of organic product development. I guess, it’s a two-part question. First, I assume those $15 million that you spent last year are also flowing this year; you are not point back on that. But then secondly, is this really more of a multi-year strategy to get more aggressive on the organic product side?
John Marr Jr.: Yes. I think it is, Scott. And I’ll be honest with you, we obviously are opportunistic and we look at this and look at where we think the greatest return can be. Markets, whether you are acquiring public companies or private companies, are rich. And as we talked about, we are doing I think a much more sophisticated look at these markets with our white space initiative in determining adjacent markets that we think can be catalyst for growth on a long-term basis, trying to pick up those extra incremental growth points on our core growth. And as we go through that, Tyler has maybe almost a unique ability to build these products and prove these products and invest. And certainly they run through the P&L and put some pressure on margins. But long-term, to have a seamlessly and integrated product that has the broad breadth of offering that the public sector can benefit from is just simply a great opportunity for us to invest. And we did last year, as you said. We are incrementally investing that this year. I think if you look at the very long-term, these are accelerating, these are situations where we’re accelerating R&D headcount into these products from future years. And I still believe that flattens -- that curve flattens well below the overall growth rate of the Company, and there will be margin opportunity there. But we won’t try to achieve that prematurely at the expense of competitiveness.
Scott Berg: We like strategy, because it’s clearly been favorable for you over the last decade. My follow-up question is on the Australian contract deal. I believe I read a press release that said you are going to be engaging with NEC for part of the implementation. I wanted to try to understand and I know that you are bringing your own employees over there to help that as well. Trying to understand, A, their involvement; and then B, is that part of the long-term strategy as you go international that you probably have to engage with some other professional services or integrators, implementers to actually get these products live?
Lynn Moore: Yes. Scott, this is Lynn Moore. I think that’s more of a case-by-case strategy. This is our first foray. We are sending our people down there; we’ll get our expertise there. We felt it was necessary to partner with NEC for parts of this. I don’t know that we’re going to -- we’re sitting here today saying that’s our long-term strategy. Like I said earlier, it’s most important that we get Northern Territories up and running. We’ve got so much success in United States, we’ve got so much creditability here, that carries through down there, but getting them up and running, getting them functional, getting them live, doing all the things that we do here in the United States is what’s going to put us at a competitive advantage for the rest of the opportunities there. So, we’ll look at that as we go forward. I wouldn’t say that’s a long-term or specific business model.
Operator: Our next questioner today is Brian Kinstlinger with Maxim Group. Please go ahead.
Brian Kinstlinger: Thanks so much. It’s a follow-up question, kind of what some people have asked. A year ago, you announced increased investments in NWS; and again, you are putting money into that to improve their products and their win rates. Were you aware of their lower win rates when you bought them? And then, the $60 million or so that you are increasing it sounds like in R&D, is that enough to get the software where you needed to be or do you think you’ll have to increase investments even more in 2018?
John Marr Jr.: We knew the win rates when we did the acquisition. They’re probably deteriorated. These things bounce around marginally from there. And that analysis for us suggested that we should make this level of investment. So, we certainly knew the win rates; we knew the market landscape; we’re familiar with the competitors in that space. It’s a very competitive market space and it’s more fragmented than the other markets that we’re in. It’s just kind of less mature than the other markets we’re in. And that works both ways. It requires an investment and it requires great execution to gain in that space. But, in terms of working both ways, it also has a significant opportunity that comes along with it. The win rates that we have with products like MUNIS and Odyssey, they simply can’t go up that much because there isn’t that much room left. They are already winning significant shares of the marketplace. We can broaden the footprint a little bit, we can bolt on extensions, things we’re talking about which we were very focused on, but the public safety market, it wasn’t so much exactly what the market share was as the opportunity that was compiling to us that drove the decision to do that deal. In terms of the level of investment, yes, we believe we’re making the right level of investment. Obviously, there has been a lot of exchange between the leadership of that division and the corporate executive team, in terms of determining exactly where that was, we don’t want to lose the discipline that Tyler has in these areas, but we do want to be aggressive about taking advantage of the opportunities that are there. So, every credible investment, whether it’s in feature and function, whether it’s in technology or whether it’s in the integration to the other Tyler criminal justice products, all of those are funded. I believe that our product roadmaps that are very detailed are pretty solidly in place for the next two years. So, I believe that the headcount and the level of investment that we’re sharing with you now is pretty certain for the next two years. Obviously, years out from there, as I said, more broadly earlier, I would expect that the growth and expense in R&D would level in relation to the overall growth, and we start to see that leverage kick in. But I think the level of investment for the next two years is pretty well known.
Brian Kinstlinger: And then my follow-up again on NWS, when you acquired them, their margins were much higher than yours. Is that a function of the lack of investing maybe they had? Tyler has been tremendous in investing in their existing products. And then, I just wanted to make sure I heard you correctly, despite their lower win rates, they are growing as fast as the Tyler business?
John Marr Jr.: Their margins were higher than Tyler’s blended margins. So, when you look at the whole company, they were in line with some of our more mature divisions, simply because our more matured divisions are larger. And everybody runs these companies a little differently. New World was incredibly successful company. But, I would say, it was being run a little tighter than we run operations. And these are somewhat subtle differences. But yes, I would say our level of long-term investment is little bit higher, maybe our level of investment in some of the service deliverables is a little bit higher. And if you’re interested in taking advantage of the highest growth rate you can achieve on a sustain basis, the Tyler model would suggest running at a little less tight, and that’s what we’ve done. And we look at that as kind of a -- as we absorb the company into our model, kind of a one term adjustment and then we will get back into a margin expansion mode and eventually get back to and hopefully above the margins they achieved. But with our objectives as a public company and growth oriented, we’re running it a little less tight than it was run.
Brian Miller: And Brian, from a growth rate perspective, yes, they’re growing in line with or as I said, just slightly maybe a point above Tyler’s overall growth rate in 2017. As John mentioned, their wins rates are lower than some of our other Tyler products, just because it’s a more competitive marketplace today; there are greater number of competitors. And New World doesn’t focus historically on the entire public safety market; they really focus primarily on the mid and lower mid part of that market. So with these initiatives and including some of the things we are doing today, we are going after a much bigger public safety market. So, we want to have higher win rates and in a bigger slice to the market. So, they are still able to -- and it is a growing marketplace. So, even with the win rates we are at today we are able to grow that business. But, longer term, we think that opportunity for it to grow above our overall growth rate and contribute to long term growth is significant.
Operator: Our next questioner today is Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Kirk Materne: Maybe just to start, John, have you guys seen any major change or I guess any incremental change rather in terms of people looking more at the cloud offering versus the on-prem? I guess I am trying to get a sense on what you guys are thinking that might look like in 2017. And does that have any sort of impact -- obviously, it’d be positive bookings, but does that have any impact on your revenue guidance for next year?
John Marr Jr.: The answer would no. No major change. It bounces around. If you look at an individual quarter, you can see changes. But, if you are tracking trailing 12-month rates, we remain in this kind of 30, low 30% adoption in the new market, both in terms of names and dollars. Yes, it shows up heavier in the bookings and the backlog and yet puts pressure on short-term. But being somewhat stable, and I’ve said this for years that Tyler kind of has the best of both worlds. We haven’t taken a big hit on margins or earnings in order to support our cloud business. So, it’s been growing in parallel and the adoption works well for us. Our strategy doesn’t have bias. If you are on-prem only or cloud only, then you are missing a significant segment of the marketplace. And we are a comprehensive vertical player and want to have strong offerings in both of those channels and we do. And as you can see, we are looking at 20 to little better than 20% growth in both perpetual licenses as well as cloud. And I think there really aren’t a lot of companies that cannot cannibalize their perpetual licenses and even grow on as they grow a nice cloud business. So, we are pleased with that.
Kirk Materne: And Brian, maybe for you, just the e-filing business in 2017 versus 2016, are you still expecting a little bit of a step up on that? Can you just remind us sort of what the assumption is for that for this year? Thanks.
Brian Miller: Yes. I think for 2017 in e-filing, our expectation is mid teens growth, pretty similar to the kind of growth we saw in e-filing in 2016. So, I think we grew it roughly 15% in 2016 and it’s growing somewhere around that same rate in 2017. As you know, we have somewhat long lead times on some of these. We have a number of e-filing arrangements that we have a lot of visibility over, jurisdictions that are either already committed to doing e-filing with us but won’t start until some point in the future, perhaps when their an existing case management implementation goes live, there are number of those in California, for example. Others where they are currently doing e-filing but we are rolling out it across the state in the safe manner or in places that are doing e-filing today but it’s not mandatory; and as they move to mandatory somewhere down the road, the volumes and the revenues will increase. So, we’ve talked about over the next three to five years expecting to grow that business from -- we finished with e-filing revenues in 2016 just shy of $37 million, to grow that, with the visibility we have today over that going to roughly double to around $75 million over the next four to five years. So, to get there, we would look for that then to accelerate a bit from that level and grow more in the 20% range in sort of 2018, 2019, 2020 timeframe. So, we do expect with some of the visibility we have for that growth rate to accelerate and some of these go lives happen in 2018 and 2019.
Operator: Our next questioner today is Tim Klasell with Northland Securities. Please go ahead.
Tim Klasell: Yes. Just two quick questions, one from a high level on the international, particularly in Australia, obviously courts and justice is sort of a kick off there. Have you thought of some of your other products like public safety? Is that something you would want to bring international to, just given that that might have a broader reach besides the countries that have the same language and -- or similar legal systems I should say as the U.S., so i.e., could public safety or others expand into other international markets as well?
John Marr Jr.: Yes. And I would say, our strategy again, this is something you just want to put on the list of these incremental growth drivers over a long period of time, nothing explosive in the short-term, kind of leading with courts and justice. We look at our products, everything is vertical, but some things are more vertical than others, and those would be applications that kind of exclusively work in the public sector, so courts and justice; public safety; tax and appraisal, some of these kinds of applications. Those kind of hyper-vertical applications that are exclusive to the public sector versus maybe enterprise apps like financials and human resources and others are likely the products we would move internationally with first. And so, public safety for both of those reasons being sub-vertical as well as being related to our courts and justice offering, if it becomes established in certain markets, would be a candidate for that. Right now, we’re obviously very focused on the things we’ve been discussing on the call in terms of the current investments in those products and achieving higher market share and the broader footprint here in the states. But it certainly is a candidate down the road for international expansion.
Tim Klasell: Okay, great. And then just a detailed question for you, Brian. On the effect of 2016-09, as we look at share count growth going forward, even past 2017, does that affect that at all, or is that just a one-time step up and then we can keep the same sort of share count growth going forward?
Brian Miller: It is primarily -- we’ll kind of see how it shakes out. I think it’s primarily a one-time sort of step-up, we think increased our share in 2016 and 2017, and it increases our shares by about 1.3%. To the extent that we have a much-larger stock option exercise gain, it could increase that slightly. But, I think it’s going to be right around that rate. So, I don’t think it moves as much as it moves the tax rate.
Operator: Our next questioner today is Jonathan Ho with William Blair & Company. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Ho: Let me echo my congratulations as well. I just wanted to start out with a question around your comment around the public safety market expanding by potentially four times. Can you give us a little bit more color on maybe where this will come from and maybe how quickly investments can open up that much of a market expansion?
John Marr Jr.: Sure. I guess, it’s two different things. We’ve talked about expanding the breadth of the product. So, it will include incremental products that are either part of the core sale or add-on sales over time. But, the larger driver would be the size of the jurisdictions that we’re competitive in. And as Brian indicated earlier, New World has been mostly a mid-range player, not to say they haven’t done smaller and larger deals, but that’s been there sweet spot. And the most significant growth in the addressable market would be from being able to move up into tier 0, tier 1 opportunities and down as well and broaden the size of that addressable market. So, this is a long-term initiative. But, making progress on win rates and market share and growing in larger footprint it is our strategy.
Jonathan Ho: And then, just as a follow-up, I know there was some noise during the quarter that was related to court case implementations; I think you guys have put out several press releases tied to that. I just want to sort of verify that there was no real long-term impact to your business or win rates or to the backlog.
John Marr Jr.: No, there hasn’t been. Obviously, it’s a distraction. We’ve got a lot of customers. We have hundreds of implementations underway at any given time. And depending on how you measure, 15,000 clients. So, it’s a challenging business, and there will be issues. And normally Tyler does an exceptional job on execution and getting through the challenges of implementations and customer issues. These two have gotten a little hotter than what we normally experience, and unfortunately a little more public. We don’t like to resolve customer issues publically. But, I think what we’ve said, you can go out and read, which really is that these are issues specifically associated with those particular accounts. We don’t believe we’re the direct cause of those things; we can be the solution to those issues or those accounts if they want us to be. So, we’re working with them to achieve those things. But no, it has not manifested itself and any effect on our new business that we can see in a meaningful way. Obviously, there is a number of dynamics that affect every new business decision or customer situation, but it has not become a meaningful problem for us outside of those specific accounts.
Operator: Our next questioner today is Kevin Liu with B. Riley and Company. Please go ahead.
Kevin Liu: I guess first question here just regarding the 70% increase in the New World Systems pipeline. Could you just elaborate a little bit on some of the factors driving that, whether it’s cross-selling into your customer base, have better field coverage or maybe just larger transactions in general?
John Marr Jr.: Yes. It sounds like a big number. I don’t know that it is that kind of enormous change in that market space other than to say, it’s healthy and it’s growing. We may be more aggressive in identifying opportunities. We’re broadening that footprint, probably even ahead of our capabilities to be competitive in some of those spaces. So, I think the data point is to establish, but it’s a large and growing market place that we have a broader look at that market than we have in the past or they had in the past. So, there is a substantial opportunity there.
Kevin Liu: And I think in recent years, John, you’ve characterized the market for MUNIS and other financial products as being pretty robust. How would you characterize it at present, and what sort of factor and how does that play into the guidance for the current year?
John Marr Jr.: It’s probably modesty higher. It has been steady, robust to some degree, not explosive. And leading indicators would suggest that that’s at least stable if not modestly growing. And they have done a great job in improving their win rates and the competitive position. So, the challenge is obviously to sustain the growth rates they’ve had historically. And again, win rates have allowed them to continue to do that and we’ll continue to work with those products aggressively to try to sustain that.
Operator: Our next questioner today is Shane Svenpladsen with Avondale Partners. Please go ahead.
Shane Svenpladsen: Good morning. With respect to e-filing opportunities, other than Michigan, are there any opportunities in the market right now that you are tracking?
John Marr Jr.: We normally wouldn’t comment on opportunities in the marketplace. We announced on this call or talked about on this call, Maine, which includes a 10-year e-file arrangement on a fixed fee basis. The numbers that Brian spoke of doubling the e-filing revenues in the coming four or five years really only includes things like Maine and things like other opportunities that we have high levels of visibility on. But generally, to answer your question, sure, there are opportunities out there. Our expectation is that the majority of the marketplace will have paperless court houses and e-filing and usually with a mandate on that in the coming years. So, there is incremental opportunity beyond that. But, generally, we wouldn’t comment on specific opportunities in the new business market.
Shane Svenpladsen: And then, just quick housekeeping item. What were Microsoft Dynamics royalties in the quarter?
Brian Miller: Sure. Dynamics royalties were about $432,000 and that’s compared to $319,000, last year’s fourth quarter. And then our direct royalties from our Dynamics deals sold by us were $1.3 million.
Operator: Our next questioner today is Mark Schappel with Benchmark. Please go ahead.
Mark Schappel: Just one question here, John. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned that you are planning to invest in certain product areas where the Company doesn’t have a leadership position today. And I was wondering if you could just give us some indication what some of those areas would be outside of public safety?
John Marr Jr.: Yes. I guess, leadership is a relative term. But for example, Odyssey’s position in case management and electronic filing would be very strong. And by anybody’s definition a leadership position, our presence in jail, while it could be strong in certain markets, may not be anywhere near that level of market share and leadership. So that would be an example of -- and it really speaks to our overall growth strategy. So, we see a little lower growth rate this year. You could say that the trend, that core growth on a bigger base as we said just naturally is going to decline over time. We are not accepting of that. And this would be one of many areas where we say, hey, can we have the presence in jail that we have in case management? Can we have the presence in other areas? Inorganic example would be ExecuTime, obviously EnerGov a few years ago. So, the whole white space initiatives is to find these contiguous products and market spaces that we either have a smaller footprint in or smaller presence and invest in those organically or in the case of an EnerGov or an ExecuTime, acquire something that we can then invest in. Really even e-file with this way with Wiznet a number of years ago now, and have an incremental catalyst to growth that takes what may be a natural core growth rate of 10% or 11% and get you back on that 13%, 14%, 15% growth range. So, that’s what that whole strategy is about. 
Operator: Our next questioner today is Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes. Hi there. This is Matt on for Pat. Thank you very much for taking my question. I just have two. I guess, one, could you comment a little bit on the M&A pipeline; and two, have you seen any change in the demand environment at a rate at which your prospects and customers are willing to adopt technology under the new presidential administration?
John Marr Jr.: Obviously, I wouldn’t comment on a specific M&A opportunity. But generally, I think, I said earlier in the call, it’s a rich environment right now. And some of these kind of white space initiatives that we’re working on that we’d love to do an acquisition on, in a lot of cases it’s just richer than our taste. We’ll always be opportunistic and disciplined. And so, my expectations would be that it would not be a real hot market in 2017. That can change tomorrow with one deal, as you know. But, as a general observation, it’s a pretty rich market. And I’d probably take the under, if we were trying to put a historical number out there against that. The President, we had asked about this. We’ve seen some notes even that could suggest less investment or spending under a Trump administration. I’d just remind everybody that everything we do is essential to local government and it is non-discretionary, they have to do. And we don’t see a lot of changes, even in timing at this point in time. So, the answer to that would be, no, we haven’t really seen any changes.
Operator: It looks like we have no further questions. So, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. John Marr Jr. for any closing remarks.
A - John Marr Jr.: Great. Well, thank you all for joining us on the call today. I appreciate all your questions. If there are any further questions, feel free to reach out to Brian and Lynn or myself, and we would be happy to work with you. Thanks again. Have a great day.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you all for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

Operator: Good day and welcome to the Tyler Technologies Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. Please also note that this is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Marr, the President and CEO. Please go ahead, sir.
John Marr: Thank you. And welcome to our third quarter 2016 earnings call. With me on the call today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I would like for Brian to give the Safe Harbor statement. Next, I’ll have some preliminary statements. Brian will review the details of our third quarter results and the 2016 guidance. Then, I’ll have some final comments and we’ll take your questions. Brian?

Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. John?
John Marr: Our third quarter operating results were once begun very strong, and earnings exceeded our expectations. Total GAAP revenue growth was 29%, of which approximately 11% was organic. Our cloud-based business continues to experience strong growth. Increases in SaaS revenues as well e-filing revenues from courts drove 27% growth in our recurring revenues from subscriptions, of which 23% was organic. Bookings for the quarter rose 43% to a new quarterly high of $266 million and our backlog rose over 23% to reach a new high of $936 million. During the quarter we signed a four-year extension with a Texas office of court administration for our Odyssey File and Serve platform for eFileTexas. The initial contract runs through August 31, 2017 and this agreement which is valued at approximately $72 million extends that through August 31, 2021. Also for our Odyssey File and Serve platform we signed an agreement with the administrative office of the Illinois courts to provide a statewide e-filing system, which will service the Illinois Supreme Court, Illinois Appellate court, and 87 circuit courts throughout the state and is initially valued at approximately $8 million. The value of this contract is expected to grow as additional courts are added. Our largest license fee for the quarter was with Baton Rouge, Louisiana for our MUNIS ERP and ExecuTime timekeeping solution valued at $4.5 million. Other significant license agreements for our MUNIS ERP solution included the city of Goodyear, Arizona, Santa Margarita Water District in California, the City of Ogden, Utah and the City of Lompoc, California which also includes our EnerGov solutions. Significant SaaS agreements for MUNIS included the Chula Vista, California, the city of Oswego, Illinois and Bonneville County, Idaho. For our New World ERP solutions, significant contracts included the city of Delray Beach, Florida, which also included our EnerGov solution and Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. Other significant contracts for our EnerGov solution included a licensed deal with the city of Alexandria, Virginia and a SaaS contract with Hawaii County, Hawaii. For our iasWorld appraisal and tax solution, we signed notable contracts with Volusia County, Florida and Monroe County, Pennsylvania, which also included appraisal services valued at approximately $5 million. We also signed a deal for our AES tax solution with Ventura County, California. Our largest SaaS deal for the quarter was a five-year multi-suite arrangement with Amarillo Texas for our MUNIS, EnerGov, and Eagle Recorder solutions valued at approximately $3.5 million. For our Odyssey courts and justice solution we signed notable SaaS deals with Tazewell County, Illinois and Collin County, Texas as well as a license deal with Multnomah County, Oregon. We also signed significant new license contracts for our New World public safety solution with Dona Ana County, New Mexico, which also included our soft code solution, Athens/Clark, Georgia -- Athens/Clark County, Georgia, which also included our Brazos solution, and in Deschutes County, Oregon. Now I would like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and update our annual guide abs for 2016
Brian Miller: Thanks, John. Yesterday Tyler Technologies reported its reports for the third quarter ended September 30, 2016. I’m going to provide some additional data on the quarter’s performance and update our guidance for 2016 and then John will have additional comments. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. These measures exclude write downs of acquisition-related deferred revenue and acquired leases, share-based compensation expense, the employer portion of payroll taxes on employee stock transactions, and amortization of acquired intangibles. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. GAAP revenues for the third quarter were 194.5 million, up 28.9% with 10.8% organic growth. New World contributed GAAP revenues of 27.4 million, representing 18.1 percentage points of growth. On a non-GAAP basis, revenues were 197.8 million, up 31.1%. New World contributed non-GAAP revenue as $30.7 million representing 20.3 percentage points of non-GAAP revenue growth. Non-GAAP organic growth was 10.8%. Software license and royalty revenues increased 27%. On an organic basis, license revenues increased 2.9%. Subscription revenues increased 27% with 23.3% organic growth. We added 50 now subscription-based arrangements and converted 18 existing on-premises clients representing approximately $22.7 million in total contract value. In Q3 of last year, we added 35 new subscription-based arrangements and had 18 on-premises conversions, representing approximately 27.2 million in total contract value. SaaS clients represented approximately 28%s of our new software clients in the quarter compared to 22% in the prior year quarter. SaaS contract value represented 29% of the total new contract value signed this quarter compared to 30% in Q3 last year. The value-weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 5.6 years compared to 5.8 years in last year’s third quarter. Transaction-based revenues from e-filing for courts and online payments, which are included in subscriptions, increased 14.2% to $12.5 million from $11 million last year. That amount includes e-filing revenue of $9.5 million this quarter, up 11.9% over last year. Cash flow from operations grew approximately 22% to $67.1 million. Free cash flow, which is calculated as cash from operations less capital expenditures, was $59.5 million compared to $52.7 million in last year’s third quarter. Excluding real estate costs, free cash flow was $62.2 million. Our CapEx for the quarter of $7.6 million included $2.7 million related to the expansion of our Yarmouth, Maine facility. We ended the quarter with a total of $57.3 million in cash and investments and debt of $34 million. Days sales outstanding and accounts receivable was 87 days at September 30, 2016 compared to 77 days at September 30, 2015. Our backlog at the end of the quarter reached a new high at $935.6 million, up 23.5%. Software-related backlog, which excludes backlog from appraisal services contracts, was $892.1 million, a 26.1% increase. Backlog included $236.2 million of maintenance, compared to $171.9 million a year ago. Subscription backlog was $337.5 million, compared to $236.9 million last year, and includes approximately $114 million related to fixed fee e-filing contracts. As John mentioned earlier, we signed the eFileTexas extension this quarter which added approximately $72 million to backlog and also signed a new fixed fee e-filing arrangement with the state of Illinois, which added approximately $8 million to backlog. The state of Illinois is now our third fixed fee filing arrangement along with Texas and Indiana. Our bookings for the quarter which are calculated from the change in backlog plus non-GAAP revenues were approximately $266 million, an increase of 43% from Q3 of 2015. Q3 bookings included $32 million from New World. On an organic basis, bookings excluding New World grew 25.8%. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $847 million, a 31.7% increase over the prior period. Note that we have posted a spread sheet detailing our quarterly bookings calculation on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.tylertech.com/investors under the Financials and Annual Report tab. We signed 38 new contracts in the third quarter that included software licenses greater than $100,000, and those contracts had an average license of $369,000, compared to 28 new contracts with an average license value of $579,000 in the third quarter of 2015. Last year’s third quarter bookings included a $30 million tax software contract with Cook County, Illinois. Our updated guidance for the full year of 2016 is as follows -- we currently expect 2016 GAAP revenues will be between $755 million and $762 million and non-GAAP revenues will be between $770 million and $777 million. We lowered the high end of the revenue guidance by 3 million. This is primarily attributable to delays in awards and contract signings for certain courts and justice deals that were in our plan for the second half of the year, some of which have now been awarded or signed. These delays affected the timing of revenue recognition, particularly in professional services and to a lesser extent licenses and maintenance. This only affects the timing of revenues as we have not lost deals that we expected to win. We’ve also appropriately managed expenses and have raised our earnings guidance. We expect 2016 GAAP diluted EPS will be approximately $2.01 to $2.07. We expect 2016 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be approximately $3.46 to $3.52. For the year, estimated pretax non-cash share-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $29.5 million to $30.5 million. We expect R&D expense for the year will be approximately $42 million to $44 million. Fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between 38.5 million and 39 million shares. The share count is impacted by both the timing and volume of stock option exercises and stock repurchases. We estimate the GAAP annual effective tax rate for 2016 will be between 38% and 39%. The non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 35.5% to 36.5%. The tax rate is affected by the timing and volume of stock option exercises. With the issuance of ASU No. 2016-09, compensation, stock compensation topic 718 on March 31, which will require us to recognize the income tax effects of stock option exercises in the income statement, both our GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates could differ substantially from this guidance. While we will adopt this standard in the fourth quarter of 2016, we’re currently unable to provide a reasonable estimate regarding the financial impact. We expect our total capital expenditures will be approximately $40 million to $42 million for the year including approximately 21 million related to real estate including the purchase in Q1 of our previously leased office facility in Falmouth, Maine and the expansion of our owned office facility in Yarmouth, Maine. Total depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $50 million to $51 million, including approximately $36 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. I would like to turn the call back over to John for his further comments.
John Marr: Thanks, Brian. Activity in the local government software market remains strong and is consistent with the past several quarters. Our competitive trends and win rates continue to be high across our product lines. As Brian detailed earlier, a performance in the third quarter exceeded our expectations and we’ve raised our earnings guidance for the full year. New World’s operations remain on track to deliver the revenue and earnings contribution that we expected at the beginning of the year. We continue to be pleased with our progress on the integration of New World’s products and operations. And we continue to receive positive feedback from our clients and prospects regarding our strategy to bring more closely together Tyler’s public safety and justice solutions. This was evident last week at the International Association of Chief of Police conference in San Diego where we saw an unprecedented level of interest from attendees in the Tyler Alliance vision for our integrated public safety and justice offering. Yesterday we also announced several executive transitions and promotions. Effective January 1, 2017, I will assume the role of Chairman of the Board in addition to my position as Chief Executive Officer, with John Yeaman continuing his service as director until his current term ends in May of 2017 when he will retire. I would like to thank John for his service over the last nearly 20 years, his leadership to the company. I think the team that we have today and their ability to work together with little distractions and the intangibles that provides to our culture are attributable largely to John’s leadership over the last 20 years. Lynn Moore has been named President of Tyler, also effective January 1, 2017. Lynn has served as a Tyler leader and a close executive advisor to me for many years, and as President will work with me to continue the management and culture that have made us successful as a company. Lynn joined Tyler as general counsel in September of 1998 and has also served as executive vice president since February of 2008. Abby Diaz, currently Vice President and Associate General Counsel is being promoted to the position of Chief Legal Officer, assuming leadership of Tyler’s in-house legal team. Prior to joining Tyler in 2012, Abby practiced law with Kirkland and Ellis. These changes do not indicate that we are taking the company on a different course. We have seen significant growth in recent years and these changes are reflective of the way the company has developed. Tyler is fortunate to have strong leaders across our organization, with tremendous depth in our group presidents and division leadership and it’s reassuring to know we have multiple people capable of making right decisions for Tyler. Lynn and I look forward to continuing to work together with our entire team on the evolution of the business, building on the momentum Tyler has experienced. Finally, last Thursday we celebrated a major milestone -- the 50th anniversary of the company’s founding in 1966. Members of our management team rang the closing bell on the New York Stock Exchange to commemorate the event. On this occasion, we looked back with a sense of pride and the company’s successful evolution over the past half century, but more importantly we look forward to realizing the tremendous opportunities in front of us for the coming years. Now we’ll take your questions.
Operator: Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian of the Maxim Group. Please go ahead.
Brian Kinstlinger: Hi, great. Thanks so much. I’m wondering if you could update us on the competitive landscape in e-file as well as CMS if any new players have entered the market. And then related to that, can you update us on the Australian opportunity and how that competitive market differs?
Brian Miller: Sure. No, we really haven’t seen any new players enter that market. The market as you know they’re generally larger deals and a little lumpier. It’s been a little lighter through the first three quarters of the year, but it’’ certainly not reflective of the competitive position. We continue to win virtually all of the larger more meaningful deals. And we do expect -- the pipeline shows that in the fourth quarter and in the next year that things become more active again. Australia, there are two active books on the street. We feel we’re -- obviously it’s a new market to us and we’re not as familiar with the processes. But we feel well positioned in both of those deals and those decisions should occur either in the fourth quarter or during the first half of next year.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Pete Heckmann of Avondale Partners. Please go ahead.
Pete Heckmann: I had a question on the Texas renewal. Were there any notable changes in terms or conditions? Just in terms of the run rate I was looking at, it seemed like the renewals were just a little bit less than the current run rate.
Brian Miller: Notable is a relative term. Not very notable. It’s substantially very much a similar arrangement. The run rate as you observed may be very, very modestly lighter but we also believe that now with several years of experience and a very strong partnership, not only with the courts but with the bar, that there could also be other revenue opportunities that could more than offset the very modest haircut in the run rate.
Pete Heckmann: Okay. That’s fair. And then you mentioned that Illinois will be your third fixed-fee e-filing deal. Just in terms of the relative economics, I assume fixed-fee deals offer you more certainty but less growth. Which way do you think the market may trend? Do you think there’s possibility that some of the states would allow transaction fees to convert to fixed?
John Marr: Well, they’re really not that different. We are committed to our e-filing solution being a more of a SaaS-type arrangement and not offering it as a licensed event with ongoing support. The courts like to have some certainty in what that’s going to be. So in some cases when they’re absorbing those costs, it obviously makes sense for them to be able to quantify that and budget for it. But it really is looking at what are mature transaction levels, right? There isn’t tremendous fluctuation in those levels. And so looking at what those levels are and really backing into an annual fee that would be very similar to a transaction fee. So I think it’s just really reflective of us obviously being a flexible partner in structuring the contract the way it works for them. But the revenue that’s generated from the arrangement is very similar regardless of the way it’s contracted.
Pete Heckmann: That’s fair. That’s fair. And just one last question and I’ll back in the queue. Brian I may have missed it. Did you provide royalties, Microsoft royalties for the period?
Brian Miller: No. Microsoft royalties this quarter were $1.4 million.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Kirk Materne: Thanks very much. John, just in terms of the courts and justice deals that were pushed out, were those awarded deals and they are a rolling them out more slowly or is the actual awarding of the deal getting pushed out? I’m just trying to get a sense on whether you guys have already been awarding the deal and it’s just a matter of rev rec or are your seeing more of a pause in people actually being able to deals as well?
John Marr: It would be both. There are -- Tyler-wide, we’ve mentioned this but we would kind of not rather get into tracking it. But over the past year there has been more awarded business that hasn’t contracted at Q end as is typical and that certainly has been the case with C&J. There are a couple notable deals that have been awarded but have not yet been contracted and therefore aren’t bookings and backlog but they’re literally at the very, very end. And that has impacted the very marginal adjustment on revenues. It’s somewhat attributable to that. These deals that we’ve had good visibility on for some time, in some cases we thought we would start a little bit earlier. We maybe lose a quarter of maintenance and a bunch of small things that add up to the few million dollar adjustment in revenue. So that is the case. As I indicated earlier, though, the fourth quarter and into next year, the pipeline starts to become more active again.
Kirk Materne: Great. And then just Brian, obviously 26% organic growth is really strong. Is there any way for us to think about it either on this quarter or more of a trailing 12 month basis what annualized bookings growth look like? I know a lot of people have questions as to you want more of an ACB figure would be relative to your guys’ longer term growth outlook into the low/mid-teens.
Brian Miller: Yes. On a trailing 12-month basis, our organic bookings growth is just shy of 12.5%. So that smooths out some of these lumpier deals in there in the individual quarters. It’s in that low double-digit range.
Kirk Materne: Okay. Is that fair to look at that as more of an annualized figure too?
Brian Miller: I would say so.
Kirk Materne: I know you have longer term deals. Okay, great. Thanks guys, I appreciate the time.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jonathan Ho of William Blair & Company. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Ho: Hey, guys, congratulations on the strong quarter. I just wanted to start out. You mentioned a number of deals that had EnerGov attached to them and I’m just wondering if you are seeing more of a trend towards larger deals that maybe are incorporating multiple systems?
John Marr: Yeah, I think we are. EnerGov will be the best example of it. It’s basically if you look at Tyler and our win rates and our competitive positions have become very strong and you then look to, okay, how do we expand the addressable market space -- EnerGov is a great example of it where you used to have more of a lightweight solution in that space that was part of a broader Tyler suite. You now have a heavier enterprise application that can be plugged into those lines basically and a proposal and drive incremental value in that engagement. And there are several other opportunities like that that we’re focused on. ExecuTime is a little of that to some extent. But there are others that can be acquired and there are others that can be built, and that is part of our strategy to basically add more and more value to the relationships we have and drive incremental revenue and expand the addressable market space as our competitive position is driving win rates that are hard to continue to drive much higher.
Jonathan Ho: Got it. And then with the $8 million Illinois deal that you referenced on the e-file side, what is the potential for that opportunity? Is it sort of a one-year deal if you were to expand court types? What would be sort of the largest opportunity you could see come out of Illinois?
John Marr: The Illinois contracts start out, it’s a statewide arrangement but the 15 largest counties are not initially included in it. So they have the ability to opt in. We would expect that over time and some of the starting relatively soon that some of those larger counties will opt in. So it starts out at a $8 million total contract value. So a couple million dollars a year but I think it has the ability to go up in the $5 million a year range if everyone were fully included.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Scott Berg of Needham and Company. Please go ahead.
Peter Levine: Thanks a lot. This is actually Peter Levine for Scott. Just a couple quick ones here. I know in the second half of last year, you talked about an increasing ERP pipeline. Considering your typical sales cycle, are those RFPs starting to play out now and to what magnitude?
John Marr: Yes, the ERP side of the business has performed very well this year, and has gained some momentum in the second half of the year. It’s actually one of our faster growing divisions in the company this year and probably about continue that momentum until at least the half of next year. The win rates are significantly elevated from where they were traditionally which is very encouraging. Obviously the remaining segment of the market’s being split by several other players. So we’re really pleased with that performance. They don’t tend to be the statewide C & J-type deals or the large multi-year e-file deals so we don’t drive into them as much, but that has occurred. Again the second half of the year has been very strong and we’re pleased with their performance.
Peter Levine: Question on the New World side, I believe the initial pipeline dynamics had deal signings that were going to be I guess back end loaded. Are you seeing evidence of that in the quarter? I’m just trying to better understand the seasonality of the bookings of New World.
John Marr: The back end is really all the way back to the fourth quarter. The Q3 results were pretty much a continuation of the first half of the year. Obviously their pipelines are newer to us but they have expanded. The highly qualified pipeline has expanded actually about 23% since the beginning of the year and the broader pipeline has expanded around 35% since the beginning of the year. So that pipe has built as we said before and was our expectation. So we’re encouraged by that. We had a great show as I mentioned in San Diego a couple weeks ago. we continue to be convinced that the opportunity that we saw when we did this acquisition remains and it’s a great opportunity for us.
Peter Levine: Great. Final one here. You had a nice earnings beat, I think it was $0.04 or $0.05 if I’m correct. So what cost items are driving that? Just trying to better understand if you’re gaining better leverage or cost synergies related to New World or is it coming from I guess other natural parts of the business
John Marr: Well, it’s no one major driver. The biggest thing is head count. So we approve heads in the plan and the divisional and group leadership basically has the flexibility to bring those heads in as they go. But they exercise a lot of discipline and if they’re able to get the work done, we don’t eliminate those heads out of the plan but a lot of it is just timing that different divisions and the quarter, these are divisions with hundreds and hundreds of employees that in the quarter, 23 heads light or something. So that would be the biggest driver, that company-wide we are an able to manage the timing of head count and that drives some savings. There are a number of other variables as well. And then the other contributor is basically the mix of revenues. So some of the lighter revenues really came directly out of the professional service side of the business which obviously is the lightest margin side of the business and you can see the recurrings being very strong, which is a strong margin part of the business. So a combination of all of those contributors.
Peter Levine: Great. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
Brian Miller: I would like to add a quick correction on the question about Illinois e-filing. That contract would have revenues of about $7 million a year assuming all of the counties in the state were fully onboard.
Operator: Thank you very much, sir. Our next question is from Alex Zukin of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Alex Zukin: Hey guys, thanks for taking me question and congratulations again. John, maybe can you talk a little bit more specifically about how New World has performed year-to-date on the revenue side versus your expectations? What have you been pleased with and disappointed with, and how are you thinking about New World’s organic top line growth maybe next year as it compares to kind of that low double-digit growth rate for Tyler?
John Marr: Yeah. As we said the flan is very much in line with what we had in the overall plan from the beginning of the year, both revenues and expenses. They have some of that head count management that I talked about just a minute ago, especially on the financial side. On the public safety side, expenses are in line with our expectations but they are elevated from where they were. We’ve made a very conscious decision to add heads to that side of the business. It’s a good business. It’s a leader in the business. But it’s not -- it doesn’t have the market share that say Odyssey and MUNIS and some of our very strong products have. And that’s our objective. So expenses are elevated from there, historical run rates prior to the acquisition but there’s a conscious decision on our part to add heads to R & D, add heads to service on quality initiatives, raise the reference ability, improve the product competitively, and ultimately elevate the win rates to what we experience in our real strong leadership products. Having said all that because I know we did a big acquisition and there’s a lot of interest in it, this can be a long-term process. This is not -- we don’t put the Tyler brand on it and add some heads and all of a sudden it’s an entirely different offering. That can happen over a period of years. The competitive landscape there is a very healthy one. The competition in that marketplace is not something that you’re just going to run over. There’s some good competitors there. We will be committed to it for the long term. We believe we’ll achieve that elevated leadership position over time but I certainly wouldn’t want people to have the expectation that it happens in a quarter or two.
Alex Zukin: Got it. And then if you look at the organic growth rates for the quarter and for this year, how much do you think that some of these pushouts at the end of the quarters, the shadow backlog, how do you think about what that’s shaved off of the top line growth rate for this year?
John Marr: We pay a lot of attention on the organic growth rate; much more than inorganic. And at around 11%, it’s a little lighter, it’s a fair amount lighter than the last couple years. We were up in the 16% range. I think over the long, long term we talked to you folks about low to mid double-digit organic growth and we’re in that range but on the lower end of it. I see the awards and the market activity as we get toward the ends of this year as being healthy and strong. I see us with a broader breadth of applications as we discussed with EnerGov and other opportunities. We mentioned the potential of a couple of deals in Australia, so beginning to do a little bit of international-type business. You have cycles. So as you know, we did a tremendous amount of business this California with courts. We have awards like Illinois. You have a lot of these different things that have kind of been a real strong execution mode this year especially in courts and then I think as though the counts go online and the e-file comes in behind them and you get that second recurring revenue stream of e-file on top of your maintenance, all of those things we would expect would contribute to a higher level of organic growth. So we would think this a year, a good solid year, a little bit on the lower end of the range of organic growth that we’ve experienced and yet we think there’s a tremendous number of catalysts that allows to drive that back up as we move forward.
Alex Zukin: And then John just to hit one more time on New World, do you expect to start seeing any more meaningful revenue synergies as you cross-sell New World’s products more directly into your base and you can cross-sell some of your products into the New World base? Is that something -- clearly we’ve seen some upside on the expense side this year. Should we expect to see some of that revenue synergy flow through next year? Then I’ve got a couple questions for Brian on gross margins.
John Marr: Well, until you said next year, my answer would be certainly. And I certainly won’t be surprised to see those revenue synergies materialize next year. But I’m still cautious about people having expectations quarter-to-quarter on that. But we mentioned this Chief of Police show and we’ve got SoftCode and Brazos and Odyssey and New World Public Safety and what we call Tyler Alliance and adding value across applications that no other companies can do. We have solid players in each of those spaces but nobody that owns assets across the complete offering and has the ambition we have there. It was incredibly well-received. So we’re very enthusiastic that people see the value in that and that long term we’re going to have something to offer that’s hard to compete with. But I do want to be cautious and being back on this call in 90 days and not having three names or examples for you. We’re very enthusiastic about what we’re doing there. We’re very confident that over the long run it’s going to be an offering that’s hard to compete with. But we’ll be patient to see how it materializes.
Alex Zukin: Got it. And Brian, on the gross margin side, you’re clearly exceeding your goal for gross margin expansion year-over-year. You’re up, I think 400 basis points. Your goal is to deliver 100 to 150 bases points of expansion. How should we think about continuing to see synergies on the expense side, on the margin side from New World as we get into next year?
Brian Miller: Well, clearly New World has given us a big lift this year. And we expected that. We talked at the time of the acquisition about their margin profile being higher than our blended margin profile. Not necessarily higher than some of the parts of Tyler that have similar characteristics to New World’s business, but higher than ours as a whole with a revenue mix that has more maintenance revenues in it, little bit lower level of professional services typically with mature products. So they have of a lifted our overall -- that 400 basis point margin improvement just the effect of New World being there has added roughly half of that increase. So I would expect that going forward with that now in our base, that we would be back more on that trajectory that we’ve talked about in that low double-digit revenue increase that we would be seeing again that sort of 100 to 150 basis points of margin improvement over time. That would sort be the annual average of that kind of growth rate.
Alex Zukin: Got it. And last one for me, guys, I promise. Can you remind people on your use of cash? You guys have clearly paid down a lot of debt this the year. You like to use cash for M&A but also stock repurchasing. Can you frame kind of how you look at each of those cases right now and kind of what sways the decision tree for you guys over time?
John Marr: Sure. Go ahead, Brian.
Brian Miller: No, you go ahead.
John Marr: Okay. Our primary use of cash is always our priority is investing in the company and in Tyler products and you’ve seen that with elevated investments this year both in R & D and in operating expenses related to Tyler products, and the infrastructure of the company. M&A would typically be next in our priority. So looking for good strategic fits and we would expect to continue to be active in the M&A market. As we said, we don’t see something of the size of New World on the near term horizon but we would expect to continue to be active in evaluating and pursuing the kinds of acquisitions we’ve done in the past, and certainly have the capability from a management standpoint and from a financial standpoint of being able to execute those. And then with respect to stock buy-backs, we’ve certainly been opportunistic over a decade plus and have created significant value through those buy-backs and we would expect to continue to have that as a component of our uses of cash but probably third in priority but certainly on an opportunistic look at those.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Mark Schappel of Benchmark. Please go ahead.
Mark Schappel: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question here. Brian, I wonder if you could just remind us what we could expect in the coming quarters here with respect to the e-filing in California.
Brian Miller: California e-filing actually picks up reasonably strongly next year. We’ve looked at -- right now it’s a pretty small contribution from California e-filing. It is, we’re really just starting to see a number of counties go live on the system and then the e-filing follows that. So for example right now our run rates in California this quarter was just less than a $250,000 of the e-filing revenue. And that’s expected to grow pretty meaningful next year I think to the couple million dollar run rate and over the next couple of years builds pretty significantly off of that. If we -- so somewhere in the $2.5 million to $3 million range next year and then expanding really potentially exponentially from there to potentially somewhere in the $15 million to $20 million range as both with places that are committed to us or that already use our e-filing system. But that would be over the next, say, four-year time period.
Mark Schappel: Okay, thanks. And finally John, growth in the appraisal business has trailed the core software business here, at least this year, and I was just wondering if you could run through where you think that growth rate should be in that business and also remind us some of the ties it has to the broader software business.
John Marr: Yes, I think you’re referring to the appraisal services.
Mark Schappel: Yes.
John Marr: The tax and appraisal software business has actually performed really well and growth rates higher than what we would have expected over the long term. Appraisal services are cyclical and they’re predictable and we are in state by state kind of a slow period. And we would expect that they would continue to be a little bit lighter through next year and then they’ll accelerate into 2018. But long-term growth there, we don’t look to be at high level. I think it’s more of a 5% grow over the long term which again could actually have negative growth one year and higher growth the next. And that’s not a reflection of competitive position. It’s just a reflection of how the different state cycles run which we track and know. These guys have been doing this for decades. We do like the business even though it’s little bit different than our software business. The other part of your question is, it’s an essential service. And in the states where we have these relationships, it’s another very sticky part of the relationship that supports our software relationships with these cities and counties that’s important and hard for other people to compete with. So over the years and there was a time years ago, those who have been around the story a long time, where actually appraisals services, I think, it was 27% of all Tyler revenues which made us a very different kind of companies and now it’s obvious list down in the low single digits. So it’s a nice strategic touch point on relationships with these cities and counties. It’s an appropriate percentage of our overall revenues and we’ll remain committed to it.
Operator: Thank you very much. Our next question is from Kevin Liu of B. Riley and Company. Please go ahead.
Kevin Liu: Hi, good morning. In terms of the integration of your courts and justice product with the New World public safety systems, can you update us on the timing when you could go to market with a fully integrated suite? And related to that just in terms of the conversations you’re having at the trade shows and the like. Are you expecting RFPs to come out in the next year or so for an integrated solution or is this something more that you guys are pioneering and you’re getting a favorable response to that?
John Marr: Yes. So the first part of the question, it’s a process. There won’t be some major release where these products all of a sudden are seamlessly integrated and the user experiences and the work flow and all those things are Tylerized and as if one product. that’s something we’ll achieve over time and it may be four or five years, say, before most of the major elements of that have been achieved. But I think as we indicated, even at this show a couple weeks ago, to be able to talk about and be a little bit specific about what we’re doing now and when they can see these things emerge, it will be the kind of thing that even smaller steps in delivering early indications of where we’re going validating the story we’re telling, should start to influence and we believe will start to influence decisions. We don’t -- we wouldn’t expect that all of a sudden we’ll see a big shift in our fees will come out for fully integrated criminal justice offerings. Rather we’ll continue to see a case management RFP or a public safety RFP, and we think these are always really competitive situations and when you’re a finalist with one or two other players and people who are really reaching to try to find win one of these solutions, which one of these companies do we want to go with, that the Tyler story and what it offers down the road because they are an entering into a very long-term relationship, can actually affect a decision even in the next couple of years when the deliverables aren’t that much different than they are today.
Kevin Liu: Makes a lot of sense. Thanks a lot for taking the question.
John Marr: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Tim Klasell from Northland Securities. Please go ahead.
Tim Klasell: Hey, good morning. Two quick questions. First on the New World software acquisition. Seems like it’s coming along nicely. How do you feel about doing similar sized acquisitions going forward now that you’ve digested New World? Do you consider that or is that -- should we consider that to be maybe a one-off that we might only see every two years or several years?
John Marr: Yes, it was not just a little out-sized from our historical acquisition. It was by a factor of many the largest deal we’ve done certainly based on the value of the deal. There are a very limited number of assets out there that would have that kind of value that we would see as a fit or as attractive and some of them we wouldn’t have any interest in. We don’t see the real synergies and opportunities that we saw with New World. So I can’t sit here today and say there’s no likelihood at all that we’ll do another deal of that size but again there are very limited assets that we would be interested in at that level. So the probability is of somewhat low and yet we certainly wouldn’t back off for one so there is always the possibility something could occur. If you back down from New World, most of our deals are $50 million or less, historically. And I certainly see kind of a mid-range there, $30 million to $40 million, $100 million to $120 million where we do look at companies from time-to-time that we would be anxious to do a deal on. We will be disciplined as well. Valuations are high and you don’t know the fields we don’t do it, right? So we’ve participated in a number of processes in that size range that in some cases we were just too disciplined to do the deal. But I wouldn’t consider it unlikely at all that you would see deals in that range over the coming years.
Tim Klasell: Okay, good. And then the awarded deals but not signed, it seems like this has been a little bit of a pattern over the past year and I don’t know if it’s just happenstance of that growing. Is there something changing out there in the market, or is it again just happenstance?
John Marr: I don’t think there’s much changing in the market. I think we’re doing more large deals. And when you get into large deals, just the process from award to contract is longer. It’s a more deliberate and extensive negotiating process. So they remain in that category a little longer than a standard deal that we do many of and we send them the contract and there literally would be a couple conference calls and it’s signed two or three weeks later. So I think a large -- doing more large deals contributes to that. Obviously those are big numbers so to have a big number and award an unsigned business, there could be three, four names that are driving 70% of that in some cases. What we pay a lot of attention to is how long they stay in that category. So probably 70% of that is from the current quarter. In other words, we were awarded it in the current quarter and it’s just going to slide into the next one. If they get two and three quarters old, then you start wondering whether this deal is a real deal that’s going to happen, and there isn’t much of that. I would say 70% of it’s in the current quarter and then another 15% or 20% is in the past quarter. And very little of that is stale or old or has any risk to it. So it’s good business. It’s going to occur again. There’s a number of larger deals that the process is just more extensive. There’s more negotiating when you get to an agreement, the contract literally works its way around the state house or the City Hall and has to get all the right signatures and it just takes a long time.
Operator: Thank you very much. Our next question is from Brent Bracelin of Pacific Crest. Please go ahead.
Brent Bracelin: Thank you. Most of my questions have been asked and answered but maybe I’ll ask one here on the technology side. You guys have been talking about this kind of federated foundation, common UI, common service pricing and so on for the last year. Could you maybe just provide us an update on the federated strategy where you’re at from the technology standpoint, what you’ve accomplished in the last year and when should we start to expect you to expose some of these new technologies to customers?
John Marr: Yes, we’re real pleased with it. We have talked about taking some significant leadership from different areas of the company on the technology side. Jeff Green leads a big team. And they generate technology that’s been used by the different dictions. They also coordinate with divisions that are leaders in different places. You mentioned user experience. That would be a good example of that and then expose that to the other divisions. And so it’s a process that’s changed organizationally but it’s going very well and there will be releases very late this year and early next year that will reflect that and I’ve seen demonstrations and screenshots of products from different divisions that previously you would clearly say those come from different companies and today it would take a pretty experienced eye to recognize the differences.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question is from Frank Felice of Serendipity Ventures. Please go ahead.
Frank Felice: Thank you for taking my call. A lot of the technical questions have been addressed by the group so many appreciate it. Congratulations on the great quarter. In addition to I guess going back a little bit, strong dominance in the courts base, a lot of Odyssey acquisitions, really quick in the state of California pretty much dominating most of the counties very shortly, couple year timeframe so congratulations on that and doing well and getting them moving. Also commending you on the acquisition of New World from a technology staff perspective. In comparison to some recent Motorola consolidation in the public safety market space with Motorola purchasing Spillman recently and then the consolidation that’s occurred which seals a little bit more market share consolidation rather than a real strategic technology alignment which I think was really smart from the New World perspective. You answered questions regarding New World and Tyler integration so I appreciate that and the candor that it would take, four to five years, to do a lot of integration. But the one question and maybe it hasn’t been addressed or maybe it will be addressed over time is with the acquisition of New World, there’s a little bit of overlap between your product stacks, specifically ERP and public safety. Has any decisions been made at this point as far as what direction you’ll go, ERP and public safety as well as retaining both products, leading it one of the products over the other’s, or continuing to push both. I think that’s my only question.
John Marr: It was a good observations and appreciate the question. And maybe not being active in some of the other names you mentioned shows that we are careful about creating too much conflict in our channels and our product strategies. But you can’t do a lot of big deals without some of that. And we do have -- Tyler public safety solution. It’s certainly a fraction of the size of the New World public safety solution. Obviously we’ve talked about investing heavily in the New World solution. Obviously MUNIS is one of our core products that drives highest revenues and operating profit in the company and yet New World has a very strong offering there as well. I think you can look at Tyler historically. Look at the Infinite Vision products, you look at our Incode local government products and you look at a number of different products that had niches in the marketplace that while they will may look somewhat conflicting, were they MUNIS or New World public safety or some of our large products, there’s a niche and there’s a market space there that they can continue to be effective and they have important customer bases and we have a history of continuing to invest in those products and having them continue to meet those customers’ needs for a very long period of tile and in those specific market segments, continuing to be competitive. Pleased to see obviously New World ERP isn’t going to generate the number of deals that MUNIS does, but we mentioned a number of very competitive and important wins in the quarter that continue to reinforce the competitive position and there’s segments of the marketplace where I can they will continue to be very, very competitive and provide incremental business to Tyler that we wouldn’t have had before. And reversely, the same is true of Tyler’s public safety solution where it had certain market spaces where it’s strong and while it’s a fraction of the size of New World’s public safety system, we’ll continue to maintain that product, invest in it and make sure it serves those customers’ needs and in the segments of the market where they’re strong, they’ll continue to add customers.
Frank Felice: Final item on that and I appreciate the response. Being in the business myself for the last 15, 20 years, the tag line you guys stated, most recently at IACP, "from dispatch to disposition," is strong, it’s absolutely can see how it resonated with the market. No other vendor that I can recall going back 15, even 30 years has been able to do consolidate anything from dispatch to disposition. So even -- I mean I think you even respectfully disagree, I think states like Texas and California I think Tyler will be greatly benefited by in that four to five year timeframe of integrating those products as thoughtfully and smartly as possible because those states typically Texas, California, Illinois, have a strong history of integrated criminal justice and public safety software systems that is really no other vendor is really is going to be able to pull off as one vendor solution and that’s what a good majority of these counties really want. They want that single throat-to-choke essentially rather than a piecemeal solution. So, I think it’s going to benefit Tyler in that four to five-year time from of putting thought into the integration. So that’s it. That’s all I really wanted to state but I think that’s a good message for the market because there’s no one else out there that is really going to be able to pull that off in the next four to five years.
Operator: Thank you very much. Gentlemen, we have no further questions in the queue. Do you have any closing comments?
John Marr: Well, thank you very much, appreciate everybody joining us on the call today, appreciate your interest, and if you do have any further questions, feel free to reach out to Brian or myself. Thanks again and have a great day.
Operator: Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today’s conference. Thank you for joining us and you may now disconnect your lines.

Operator: Hello, and welcome to today's Tyler Technologies Second Quarter 2016 Conference Call. Your host for today's call is John Marr, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, July 28, 2016. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Marr. Please go ahead.
John Marr: Okay. Thank you, Drew, and welcome to our second quarter 2016 earnings call. With me on the call today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like Brian to give the safe harbor statement. Next, I'll have some preliminary comments. Brian will review the details of our second quarter operating results and 2016 guidance. Then I'll have some final comments and we'll take your questions. Brian?
Brian Miller: Thanks, John. During the course of this conference call, Management may make statements that provide information other than historical information and may include projections concerning the Company's future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless we specify otherwise. John?
John Marr: Thanks Brain. Our second quarter operating results were very strong with revenue and earnings that met or exceeded our expectations. Total GAAP revenues growth was more than 29% of which organic growth contributed approximately a 11%. Our cloud based business continued to experience strong growth. Increases in SaaS revenues as well as e-filing revenues from courts rose 26% growth in our recurring revenues from subscriptions of which 22% was organic. Bookings for the quarter rose 41% and our backlog rose 20% to reach a new high of $868 million. Due to – with a very good bookings quarter for both traditional licenses and SaaS contracts with contract values of $69 million and $31 million respectively. Our largest license contracts signed during the quarter were both in Canada and both for our IAS World appraisal and tax solution. A $12 million contract with BC Assessment in British Columbia and a $6 million with the City of Calgary in Alberta. We also signed a significant agreement for our Orion Appraisal and Tax Solution with Washington County Oregon in the Portland metropolitan area. For our Munis ERP solution, our largest new license contract in the quarter was Wichita, Kansas and Los Alamos County, New Mexico. Significant SaaS agreements from Munis included Paducah, Kentucky, Alameda County, North Carolina, and Scottsdale, Arizona. We signed several multi-suite deals for our Munis ERP and EnerGov solutions, including a SaaS contract with Tulsa, Oklahoma, valued at $12 million, and a license contract with Collin County, Texas, which is the home of Tyler's headquarters in Plano. In our schools business, we signed our largest contract ever for our Versatrans solution with the Dallas County schools in Texas, which operates one of the largest district-owned fleets in the country. For our Odyssey Courts & Justice solution, we signed a new contract for our case management solution with the Superior Court of Stanislaus County in California, which becomes the 26th California County to select Odyssey. Other significant Odyssey deals included add-on contracts totaling approximately $4 million with DeKalb County, Georgia, which added Odyssey jails and other applications to its case management solution as well as follow-on agreements to expand our existing contracts with the State of Maryland and Los Angeles County Superior Court. Lastly, we had some notable contracts for our New World Public Safety solution, including a $3.7 million contract with the Manatee County Sheriff's office in Florida, and a contract with the City of Cleveland, Ohio police, an existing client, which is adding at our mobile field reporting solution to complement the New World records management system. On June 1, we acquired ExecuTime Software, a leading provider of time and attendance and advanced scheduling software solutions. ExecuTime has approximately 200 public sector clients nationwide, including municipalities, school districts and counties, many of which are also Tyler clients. Founded in 2007, ExecuTime is located in Tulsa, Oklahoma and has more than 30 employees, which are now a part of Tyler's enterprise group. Now, I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and update our annual guidance for 2016.
Brian Miller: Thanks, John. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2016. I'm going to provide some additional data on the quarter's performance and update our guidance for 2016 and then John will have some additional comments. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. These measures exclude write-downs of acquisition-related deferred revenue and acquired leases, share-based compensation expense, the employer portion of payroll taxes on employee stock transactions and amortization of acquired intangibles. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. GAAP revenues for the second quarter were $189 million, up 29.2%, with 10.6% organic growth. New World and Brazos contributed combined GAAP revenues of $27.1 million, representing 18.6 percentage points of the growth. On a non-GAAP basis, revenues were $193.7 million, up 32.4%. New World and Brazos contributed combined non-GAAP revenues of $31.9 million, representing 21.8 percentage points of non-GAAP revenue growth. Non-GAAP organic growth was 10.6%. Software license and royalty revenues increased 20.3%. On an organic basis, license revenues declined 1.4%, mainly due to lower add-on sales from our existing customer base for Courts & Justice-related solutions that assist and support the transition to paperless environment. Also, the mix of SaaS agreements to traditional perpetual software license agreements continue to impact this revenue line. Subscription revenues increased 26%, with 22.2% organic growth. We added 74 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 18 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $31.3 million in total contract value. In Q2 of last year, we added 34 new subscription-based arrangements and had 20 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $16.9 million in total contract value. You'll note that sequentially, our subscription revenues actually declined slightly, down about $121,000 from the first quarter. This is not reflective of any attrition as we had zero lost subscription customers in the second quarter and one very small lost client in Q1 but rather is a result of a couple of anomalies. First, we recorded about $475,000 of subscription revenues in Q1 as a one-time catch up on a contract signed in 2015 for which revenue recognition had been deferred due to some contractual language that was amended in Q1. Second, in Q2, we signed a renewal of our statewide e-filing contract in New Mexico. This contract previously included a revenue sharing arrangement with the state that we recorded on a gross revenue basis with an offsetting expense for the revenue share. Starting in Q2 under the new agreement, we are recognizing revenues on a net basis. The net amount to Tyler has not changed but the recorded revenue was about $278,000 less than Q2 as a result of the change. These two items together resulted in a one-time sequential decline in subscription revenues of about $753,000. I'd also point out that although we signed a high volume of new SaaS deals in Q2, most of these were signed late in the quarter, and we, therefore, recognize very little revenue from deals signed in the current quarter. SaaS clients represented approximately 33% of our new software clients in the quarter compared to 24% in the prior year quarter. SaaS contract value represented 28% of the total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 30% in Q2 last year. The value-weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 5.6 years compared to 5.0 years in last year's second quarter. Transaction-based revenues from e-filing for courts and online payments, which are included in subscriptions, increased 18% to $11.8 million from $10 million last year. That amount includes e-filing revenue of $8.9 million this quarter, up 16.9% over last year. Cash flow from operations was $13.9 million. Free cash flow, which is calculated as cash from operations less capital expenditures was $8.6 million compared to $12.7 million in last year's second quarter. Excluding real estate costs, free cash flow was $10.1 million. Our CapEx for the quarter of $5 million included $1.4 million related to the expansion of our Yarmouth, Maine facility. We ended the quarter with a total of $75.8 million in cash and investments and debt of $135 million. Days sales outstanding in accounts receivable was 100 days at June 30, compared to 94 days at June 30, 2015, with the increase due to higher maintenance receivables from the addition of New World, the majority of which will be collected in the third quarter. Our backlog at the end of the quarter reached a new high of $867.6 million, up 20% from last year's second quarter. Software-related backlog, which excludes backlog from appraisal services contracts, was $826.9 million, a 23% increase. Backlog included $235.1 million of maintenance compared to $165 million a year ago. Subscription backlog was $258.9 million compared to $229 million a year ago. Our bookings for the quarter, which are calculated from the change in backlog plus non-GAAP revenues, were approximately $253 million, an increase of 41.3% from Q2 of 2015. Q2 bookings included $41 million from New World. On an organic basis, bookings, excluding New World, grew 18.4%. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $767 million, a 26.8% increase over the prior period. Note that we have posted a spreadsheet detailing our quarterly bookings calculations on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.tylertech.com/investors under the Financials and Annual Report tab. We signed 38 new contracts in the second quarter that included software licenses greater than $100,000 and those contracts had an average license of $573,000, compared to 25 new contracts with an average license value of $484,000 in the second quarter of 2015. Our updated guidance for the full year of 2016 is as follows: we currently expect 2016 GAAP revenues will be between $755 million and $765 million and non-GAAP revenues will be between $770 million and $780 million. We expect 2016 GAAP diluted EPS will be approximately $1.98 to $2.06. We expect 2016 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be approximately $3.42 to $3.50. For the year, estimated pretax non-cash share-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $29.5 million to $30.5 million. We expect R&D expense for the year will be approximately $42 million to $44 million. Fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between 38.5 million and 39.5 million shares. The share count is impacted by both the timing and volume of stock option exercises and stock repurchases. We estimate the GAAP annual effective tax rate for 2016 will be between 38.0% and 39.5%. The non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 35.5% to 37%. The tax rate is affected by the timing and volume of stock option exercises and with the issuance of ASU No. 2016-09 Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718) on March 31, which will require us to recognize the income tax effects of stock option exercises in the income statement, both our GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates could differ substantially from this guidance. While we expect to adopt this standard in late 2016, we are currently unable to provide a reasonable estimate regarding the financial impact. We expect our total capital expenditures will be approximately $42 million to $44 million for the year, including approximately $21 million related to real estate, including the purchase in Q1 of our previously leased office facility in Falmouth, Maine and the expansion of our owned office facility in Yarmouth, Maine. Total depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $50 million to $51 million, including approximately $36 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Now, I'd like to turn the call back to John for his comments.
John Marr: Thanks, Brian. As reflected in our strong bookings this quarter, the local government market remains active and our competitive strengths are evident across our product lines. The new business pipeline is at a high level and local government budgets remain generally healthy. As we noted earlier, in view of our performance of the first half of the year and our confidence in the second half outlook, we've raised our earnings guidance. New World's operations remain on track to deliver the revenue and earnings contribution that we expected at the beginning of the year. Our integration of New World's products and operations is progressing well, and we continue to receive positive feedback from clients and prospects regarding our strategy to bring more closely together Tyler's public safety and justice solutions, with the goal of providing a unique end-to-end solution from dispatch to disposition. In that regard, we are also continuing to execute on important development projects, many of which are focused on tighter integration of Tyler's market leading products. Now Drew, we'll take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alex Zukin of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Alex Zukin: You guys had a very strong organic bookings growth number, up 18%. So maybe first one, to get the puts and takes on what drove that strength and separately, can you comment on the deals that were awarded but unsigned, maybe how that played into the bookings growth in the quarter and how that's looking for the back half of the year?
John Marr: Yes, sure. No, that's a good observation. The market was active in the second quarter, and we did well within that market. Our win rates, pretty much across the board, were strong. There were the couple of deals in Canada with IAS that we mentioned, but in general, a lot of deals across the board. I think we did 149 perpetual license deals and 74 SaaS deals. So that's a high number for us and again, reflects good activity in the market as well as good execution by our team. Time will tell, but it doesn't seem to be a blip. The unsigned awards, which we mentioned were high at the end of Q1, remain high. And obviously, there's been a rotation to many of those having signed now and being reflected in these numbers but replaced by new opportunities as well. So that continues to stay at a high level. And the outlook for the second half for the year is good. Munis was particularly strong in terms of their win rates. They continue to trend up in what is obviously one of the larger markets for us.
Alex Zukin: Got it. Great. And maybe John, can you also comment on the kind of performance of New World? How is that trending versus expectations? And also, maybe the pace of SaaS conversions versus your expectations?
John Marr: Sure. New World's very much in line with kind of the reset expectations we talked about at the beginning of the year. And yet, we're investing heavily, and we're making changes in the organization to do what we bought the company to do, especially on the public safety side, which would be to accelerate their revenues and their position in the marketplace. Certainly, we caution, I think, as we have, that, that takes a little bit of time to upgrade a product, technically and functionally, raise the level of quality and even to improve customer set and the things that are required to accelerate revenues. So, they're very much in line with what our expectations have been since the beginning of the year. We do have visibility on a number of deals in the second half of the year. So we would expect some regular cyclical uptick that we talked about. We do see that happening. But I think more meaningful acceleration is probably still a little further out when the investments we're making are more visible. In terms of SaaS conversions, they're steady. We still have a nice trend there. I think there were 18 of them in Munis alone and quite a bit more across the Company. So, that continues to be a steady source of incremental revenue in the recurring side.
Alex Zukin: Great. And then Brian, could you just remind us what's the implied guidance for the full year for the organic growth number versus last year, taking out New World from the fourth quarter?
Brian Miller: Yes, I think at the midpoint of our guidance range, with the $124 million we've talked about from New World and then there's in Brazos, which was acquired last May, so it's considered acquisition-related revenue for the first half of the year, not for the second half. But that would -- with those two, that would imply organic revenue growth of just under 12.5% for -- I think 12.3%, to be exact, for the full year.
Alex Zukin: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Pete Heckmann of Avondale Partners. Please go ahead.
Pete Heckmann: Good morning, gentlemen. Nice results.
John Marr: Thank you.
Pete Heckmann: Can you talk about the Canadian market? Clearly seeing a little bit of strength there, I think, that's been building. Can you talk about the relative size, your impression of the relative size of the market in order to grow that business? How much customization might be required to some of your existing platforms? And then as a follow on, could you also talk about the pending entry or entry into the Australian market?
John Marr: Yes, sure. We've operated in Canada with certain applications for some time. So, I think these new IAS tax appraisal deals, the product is generally ready for those projects and has existed in Canada again for a number of years. So, in terms of that suite, I think we're in good shape and not a lot to do. In some other areas, I think we do see Canada as an opportunity. The market has become maybe more fragmented and the players in that space maybe haven't strengthened in recent years. And so, there are other products that were active in Canada that will potentially require some localization and some extended functionality as we move forward. Australia is exclusively an Odyssey play for us at this point in time. We are active in a number of deals in Australia. It certainly is possible that there'll be at least a couple or a few decisions in the second half of the year that we feel reasonably well positioned for but it's still new to us. So, that is a growth opportunity for us. And Odyssey has a number of domestic significant opportunities that certainly could get closed in the second half of the year as well.
Pete Heckmann: Okay, and then I apologize if I missed it, but could you talk about Microsoft royalties in the quarter?
John Marr: Yes, they were weak and below expectations. So they were not a significant contributor in the second quarter. As we go forward, it's kind of lumpy. There are a couple of meaningful deals that we would expect might close. But as we've said in the past, we have less visibility and less control over those deals. But there really weren't any significant deals and revenues missed in the second quarter.
Brian Miller: And the royalties were about $655,000, and the direct revenues from our direct deals with Dynamics were about $1.4 million.
Operator: The next question comes from John Rizzuto of SunTrust. Please go ahead.
John Rizzuto: Alright, good morning everyone, thank you. I wanted, John, if you can, Brian, to circle back a little bit to California. Of course, it's been several years now since they kind of abandoned this -- a lot of their initiatives about the court systems and the court management systems and a lot of the other types of things around warrants and stuff like that. And at this stage, you talked about an Odyssey deal and in California and other things going on. Where is the state, if you will, if you can characterize that opportunity or where it is as far as now really having to modernize or reach objectives without a state funded or in a state-driven initiative?
John Marr: Yes, right. So the way -- you have to quote where is the state. The state is an influencer and they have certain policies and objectives that I certainly think influenced the county behavior. But there really isn't a state project at this point in time. It's the individual counties acting on their own. As we mentioned, we signed another county. I think that the big rush of counties is over and we'll do the onesies-twosies here and there, and we'll see that number creep up a little bit. We also saw, as we've indicated, we expected, more sales back into the counties where we already have a relationship. Probably the biggest opportunity going forward is as these counties come online, and we have had -- the big work at Odyssey in courts and justice in the first half of this year, has not been new market as much as executing on the business we've won. A lot of go lives and very large complex projects. So a lot of good work by our folks and that certainly will support the opportunity to sell incremental products back into those sites. And as they get established, to start to see the e-filing grow in those counties.
John Rizzuto: Okay. So it's -- okay, so overall there, that still goes the same. So that court -- and I guess what I was looking for, there was no -- was there a backlog when California started the California case management system? They said, we're going to do this for the -- from a statewide, and I guess they were saying there was no real backlog for people waiting for the state and then when the state abandoned that effort, that now forcing these courts to go out and do it on their own. That's what I was kind of trying to figure out if there was anything --
John Marr: No, there definitely was, and I'm saying that the rush of that, where we signed, what? 25, 26 or 27 counties in a pretty much an 18-month period and a few others signed with other companies, so some 30-plus counties that had been waiting and then clearly, that pent-up demand went through a process and made a selection. Those that we're in the most urgent need, I think, have made their decisions. And now you're going to see a slower trickle for the remaining counties. And the remaining counties generally are smaller. I think we have somewhere around half of the counties with somewhere around 75% of the population. So, if you're just talking about names, we have the majority of the names we're going to get. If you're looking at the entire opportunity, there remains significant opportunity to sell additional suites and products into those sites. And obviously, overtime, as e-file build itself out, significant opportunity there.
Brian Miller: The e-filing, really, starting in the second half of this year, we've seen very little e-filing revenues to date in California, but starting in the second half of this year and then certainly building in 2017, we expect to start to see more significant e-filing revenues from those that we have already signed and those that we expect to sign. I think we have six counties in California that will start some form of mandatory e-filing in the second half of 2016. So, we start to see a build in those revenues.
John Rizzuto: Great. Thanks. That was very helpful. Good quarter.
Operator: The next question comes from Mark Schappel of Benchmark. Please go ahead.
Mark Schappel: Hi. Nice quarter. Thanks for taking my question and John, if I recall correctly, the Company committed additional resources to the Dynamics business earlier in the year. And just kind of piggybacking on the previous Dynamics question, just maybe if you can just give us a little update on how you think those resources are playing out and maybe when we can expect to see them to be a material contributor?
John Marr: Actually, the net commitment at Dynamics is strong. We've kind of transitioned out of the build mode and the initial project, and we went through kind of a reset in redeployment of the people we have in the projects. So, our R&D commitment is off significantly from where it was during the build years. We did have incremental resources to support their sales channel and developing the marketplace and some incremental resources to kind of product extensions that we do for our direct deals and some ProServe people. But the net headcount and net investment has been cut from where it was during the development years.
Operator: The next question comes from Jonathan Ho of William Blair & Company.
Jonathan Ho: I just wanted to start out with New World and just to get a better sense of maybe the types of deals that you expect to see in the second half of the year. I think you guys have talked about public safety being a little bit more back-end loaded. Are the types of deals going to typically be larger? Is it going to be a different type of customer? I just wanted to understand a little bit around the dynamics around the public safety side.
John Marr: The types of deals, I don't know. There's nothing that stands out about the deals. I'd call them middle-of-the-road in terms of size. There aren't any outsize deals. Very consistent with what they've done historically. There are a number of deals pretty consistent with what our expectation was when we talked about some acceleration in the second half that we're tracking, that will be there -- had an indication of an award or feel good about. So again, our expectation is that those deals will be pretty consistent with what we thought going into the year. I think these are the kinds of deals they probably would have done on their own. I don't think the impact of Tyler, which hopefully, will accelerate that business, both our brand, our presence, the integration with our courts and justice system, and the general investment in the product. I don't think that's driving incremental business that's meaningful at this point. We would hope and expect that, that would start to happen in ’17.
Jonathan Ho: Got it. And then can you give us a sense of some of the development projects that you guys are working on? And maybe how you expect that to potentially impact either win rates or up sell opportunities as you start to complete those?
John Marr: Yes, we won't get too granular on competitive product initiatives. But we have a number of projects going on at Munis that I would consider to be competitive initiatives that are definitely discretionary. In other words, they're not associated with the commitments to customers or kind of the core things you have to do to maintain your market position. It's a conscious decision, in some cases, to extend the functionality and raise what kind of were just follow on or carry along modules to be industry leading; in some cases, technological initiatives. But we've added probably 32 heads that would fall in that category at Munis over the last 18 months and we'll continue to look for opportunities to improve that. And we're encouraged that we'd seen their win rates clearly improve as we make those investments. So, I think while it's an elevated investment and it's different than buying your stock or doing an acquisition that doesn't run through our P&L, it's a very good place for Tyler to invest and we see good results. There's elevated investment in the EnerGov solution, both on the technical side and the functionality side. That's important to get done. That's been a hyper growth product for us that needs that level of investment to sustain that type of growth. And probably another area worth mentioning is what we've been talking about, which is the New World Public Safety side, where, clearly, that was a very important strategic part of that acquisition, and we want to invest in that product and kind of Tyler-ize it to get the same experience there that we're experiencing with our Odyssey applications.
Jonathan Ho: Great, thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Kirk Materne: Thanks very much and congrats on a great quarter, guys. John, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about how sort of the New World go-to-market team and sort of the Tyler go-to-market teams are working together to try to produce some cross-sell deals or sell into each other's existing customer base. I'm just wondering what's sort of happening on that front, and any, I guess, early signs of success or is it still kind of early in terms of being able to take some of the Tyler products in the New World customer base and vice versa? Thanks.
John Marr: Yes, sure. Currently and certainly for the foreseeable future, we'll continue to maintain an independent public safety sales channel, which is the New World channel, and our Odyssey sales channel. They're very related. We hope, as you know, through integration, they add a lot of value to each of those from the other. But I still think that selling to a sheriff's department or a police department, the people, the process is different, the language. Everything that you get from having worked in those environments from selling to judges and courts. So, we will work to coordinate them very closely, but continue to maintain independent channels, I think, for some time going forward. The reception, which is not tangible, of this story and this objective is very well-received by the customers as well as prospects that we're seeing. But as I already indicated, I certainly couldn't give you names today that we've either signed or that we see in the second half of the year that we really think that this combination story influence the decision significantly. You never know for certain. I do think that those results will come as we begin not to deliver everything we're going to do, but just deliver some things that reinforce the message and the objective that we have. And I think that's probably still a year out.
Kirk Materne: Okay. And just because it's, obviously, top of all today, I was just wondering do you all run into NetSuite much on the ERP side? And just kind of curious if they show up at all from a competitive standpoint.
John Marr: No. Almost -- almost can't think of anything off top of my head but it certainly be fewer than five deals in recent years that we would have seen them if we've seen them at all.
Kirk Materne: Okay, and then just last question. Obviously, nice traction around your SaaS products. I guess, any reason that you guys play the conversion rate or the adoption rate of SaaS might accelerate over the back half of the year? Do you guys still see the -- sort of the current percentage of deals new moving this -- that are going SaaS to remain -- I'm just trying to get a sense if you're seeing reason for the adoption rate of SaaS to pick up in the back half of the year, whether it's resource constraints or whatever it might be.
John Marr: It's a good question and there isn't a great answer to it. Obviously, the SaaS traction in the first half of the year was good. The reason it's hard to answer is if you were to look at our pipeline right now and how we currently, talking to those clients, it would suggest that the SaaS traction would actually drop in the second half of the year. However, that may well not happen because most of these local government sites go out for a new solution. They don't necessarily go out and say, we want to go to the cloud or we want to stay on-premise. They go out and look for the best partner and the best solution, and so right now, we may have been selected or we expect to be selected and it was a traditional on-premise bid but what will happen now is they'll say, tell me more about that and our people will suggest they give that more consideration. And historically, a number of people that right now are in the pipeline is a traditional on-premise opportunity will switch to the cloud. And it literally can happen in the final weeks of contract negotiations. So, if things get done exactly the way they're currently in the pipeline, it would actually settle back a little bit. But I would be surprised if a number of those sites during the contract process don't change their mind and go the other direction.
Kirk Materne: Okay, great, thanks guys.
Operator: The next question is from Tim Klasell of Northland Securities. Please go ahead.
Tim Klasell: Yes, most of my questions have been answered. But just wanted to jump over to that New Mexico contract that went from gross to net. Do you have very many of those that are meaningful out there? Or is that -- is that sort of just a one-off?
John Marr: That was sort of unusual. So no, we don't.
Tim Klasell: Okay, good. And then on New World, a lot of questions about the synergies. But when you have -- when do you expect to have sort of some more integrated products out there? I know you're working on that. Is that something we should expect to see next year? Or when will we have sort of a more integrated solution out there? Thank you.
John Marr: Yes, sure. You'll see higher levels of integration, probably even late this year and into next year. It will be a process. And it won't be that there's some major release two or three years from now that delivers seamless integration. It will be incremental and it will be delivered as we go forward. And not just the integration, which is important and a big part of the story here, but incremental progress of the product, delivering functionality, which will improve the competitiveness, improving quality and the product as well, reducing defects and introducing and integrating new technology. So it's a good question. There will not be some single release that changes the world there. We will -- as I just said earlier, we will look to get some early kind of impactful deliverables out there that support the story that give clients and prospects confidence that the grander story we have is something we will deliver on. And I think that will begin to impact and escalate some of the revenues.
Tim Klasell: Great, thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Patrick Walravens of JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
Patrick Walravens: Great. Thank you and congratulations. Circling back to the NetSuite thing, I just love to hear your thoughts about whether you would expect more consolidations from these kinds of vendors in ERP and how that might eventually impact Tyler.
John Marr: I don't know. I suppose there's a lot of strategics out there willing to offer those multiples, you'll probably see more M&A. But it's just hard to know. Obviously, that seems like pretty rich deal and maybe that will heat things up a little bit. We run our Company as if it's going to be independent indefinitely. And we have a pretty healthy valuation as well. But obviously, that deal is, if it becomes a trend, we'll put a lot of companies in play but we're not in a better position to know that than you are.
Patrick Walravens: Yes, great. Thanks. And then if I could follow up on a little bit of detail around Dynamics. I'm just wondering how the change -- the changes that Microsoft has made to the underlying technology platform there, if you're going to just sort of boil it down, what have they done that sort of make it easier for you from an integration or product development point of view?
John Marr: I'm not sure I -- can you help me? What are you looking for there?
Patrick Walravens: Well, so supposedly, the new version of the product is a lot more modern, right? Is that something you're noticing as you try to partner with them and integrate with their solutions?
John Marr: It's really two different solutions. So we do have some Tyler solutions, most of it, the Munis level integrated to Dynamics. But for the most part, a Dynamics deal, whether we're doing it directly or through partners, which we're doing more of the through partner channel now, it's mostly about Dynamics itself and the story around that and less about applications we may incrementally add. We do, at times, when it's kind of sub-verticals, right, dynamics doesn't have certain real vertical local government application. So we certainly will add in Munis apps or an EnerGov app or an app that's part of the process. But generally, I think the decisions is pretty centralized around Dynamics.
Patrick Walravens: Yes. And have you noticed any -- I mean, I guess, as they're trying to push these stuff more and more to the cloud, I guess, the question is how well is that working and is that something that you're noticing?
John Marr: They are and I think generally, it's a good thing. It's a modern system and cloud is associated with that. And I think generally, it's good. We do see those, some flexibility that they will continue to not turn away on-premise business, which I think is important because there certainly are major segments of the market that haven't chose to move to the cloud. So, there are some meaningful deals we're working that will be on-premise deals. But unlike Tyler, where we kind of let the market and the customer decide, I'd agree with you, that they have a bias toward the cloud and the way they offer the product and price the product and incentivize their people, supports that. And so, I think that there will be more of a cloud mix going forward, but there is still an on-premise side to it as well.
Patrick Walravens: Great, thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Scott Berg of Needham & Company. Please go ahead.
Scott Berg: Hi, John and Brian, congrats on a good quarter. I apologize if I ask some redundant questions upon the 20-mile stretch in upstate New York that apparently doesn't have cell service. So the first question is on the guidance in the second half of the year, Brian. As you reported, 11% organic growth in Q2, the guidance suggested acceleration in the back half year but your visibility into those numbers, are they kind of in-line coming off the second quarter that you've seen in the last couple of years? Or is their visibility into the back half maybe any different on a positive or negative perspective?
Brian Miller: No, I'd say the in-line is similar to prior years. Obviously, there's more visibility the further into the year you get, more of the things that will be signed in the second half or farther along in the pipeline today are already awarded. So there's less deals that are in the early stages given the sales cycles. So that's typical. I'd say we have similar visibility. We're probably -- still with the New World businesses newer to us. So, I'd say we have little more caution, a little more conservatism as it relates to that until we become more familiar with it as we are with our longer owned businesses.
Scott Berg: Great, and then I want to talk about ERP pipeline, what's going on in the second half of the year. John, I think it was on the third quarter call last year, you talked about RPs picking up obviously, they take a little while to flow through the deals. Wanted to see if you're still seeing that activity in your pipeline and is there an expectation that some of that starts to flow out here more than in the second half of the year.
John Marr: Yes, we certainly don't want to raise -- these things can be lumpy. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves. But both the activity -- and I think of that at a higher level than what we've seen recently. And our win rate's pretty much across the board, especially with kind of our larger apps. So you saw some really good IAS stuff. Munis, exceptional second quarter in terms of awards and the outlook for the second half remains strong. Odyssey's opportunities become more meaningful in the second half as well. So we're pleased with the marketplace. It seems to be very healthy and should allow us to take advantage of these investments that we've made in our products and certainly, get our share of those opportunities.
Scott Berg: That’s all I have, thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: At this time, there appear to be no more questions. Mr. Marr, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.
John Marr: Okay. Well, thank you, Drew, and thank all of you for joining us on the call this morning. If you do have any additional questions, feel free to reach out to myself or Brian. Have a great day.
Operator: The conference has concluded. You may now disconnect your line.

Operator: Hello, and welcome to today's Tyler Technologies first quarter 2016 conference call. Your host for today's call is John Marr, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, April 28, 2016. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Marr. Please go ahead.
John Marr: Okay. Thank you, Gail, and welcome to our first quarter 2016 earnings call. With me on the call today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like Brian to give the safe harbor statement. Next, I'll have some preliminary comments. Brian will review the details of our first quarter operating results and 2016 guidance. Then I'll have some final comments and we'll take your questions. Brian?

Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless we specify otherwise. John?
John Marr: Okay. Our first quarter performance provided a strong start to 2016 with total revenue growth of 33%. Organic revenue growth was 14%, and the acquisitions of New World and Brazos contributed 18% and 1% over our growth, respectively. Continued strong growth in our cloud-based software as a service revenues as well as increased e-filing revenues from courts led to 35% growth in our recurring revenues from subscriptions, of which 31% was organic. Bookings for the quarter rose 21% based on non-GAAP revenues, and our backlog rose 17%. Excluding appraisal services, bookings were up 37%. Q1 was another very strong quarter for SaaS contract signings, with total contract value of $28.5 million. Our largest new contract signed in the first quarter was a seven year SaaS arrangement valued at approximately $5 million with the city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, of the Munis tax solution. We also signed significant SaaS contracts for our Munis ERP solution with Frederick County Public Schools in Virginia, Alvin Independent School District in Texas, Racine County, Wisconsin, Cecil County School District in Maryland, and Naugatuck, Connecticut. Notable on premises agreements for our Munis ERP solution included Sunrise, Florida, which was also included in our - which also included our EnerGov solutions, Washtenaw County, Michigan, Waynesboro, Virginia, Spotsylvania County schools in Virginia, and Deschutes County, Oregon. For our New World ERP solution, we signed license agreements with La Crosse County, Wisconsin, New Prairie United School Corporation in Indiana, and St. George Fire Protection District in Louisiana. For our New World public safety solution, we signed significant license agreements with Washington Parish Sheriff's Office in Louisiana and Greene County, Pennsylvania. Significant contracts for our EnerGov solutions included the City of Pasadena and San Luis Obispo County, both in California. We signed a notable SaaS contract for our Odyssey contract solution with Hill County, Texas. Finally, for our IAS World appraisal and tax solution, we signed notable license arrangements with Baldwin County, George, and Rowan County, North Carolina. During the quarter, we continued to make good progress on integrating New World's products and operations into Tyler, and those efforts are generally progressing in line with our plans. It's now been a little over five months since the acquisition closed, and our early observations regarding the quality of New World's people and products and their fit with Tyler have only been reinforced since then. New World is on track to contribute to Tyler's 2016 results in line with the guidance that we communicated in February, with expected non-GAAP revenues of approximately $124 million. During the first quarter, we also amended our Dynamics arrangement with Microsoft. Our resource commitment now runs through March 1, 2018, but the emphasis is moving away from development and towards sales. Our R&D resource commitment has been significantly reduced, and we also have committed new sales resources to Dynamics with a focus on helping them develop public sector partner channels. We will continue to receive royalties on public sector sales of Dynamics through 2034, and our total annual expense related to Dynamics will be about half of our previous spend. Now I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and update our annual guidance for 2016.
Brian Miller: Thanks, John. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2016. I'm going to provide some additional data on the quarter's performance and update our guidance for 2016, and then John will have additional comments. In our earnings release, we've included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. These measures exclude write-downs of acquisition-related deferred revenue and acquired leases, share-based compensation expense, the employer portion of payroll taxes on employee stock transactions, and amortization of acquired intangibles. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. GAAP revenues for the first quarter were $179.3 million, up 32.8%, with 13.8% organic growth. New World contributed GAAP revenues of $23.6 million, representing 17.5 percentage points of the growth. On a non-GAAP basis, revenues were $185.0 million, up 37.1%. New World contributed non-GAAP revenues of 29.3 million, representing 21.7 percentage points of non-GAAP revenue growth. Software license and royalty revenues increased 17.8%. On an organic basis, license revenues declined 9% mainly due to the mix of SaaS arrangements and the timing of revenue recognition. In Q1, we received $904,000 of royalties on public sector sales at Microsoft Dynamics AX, up 6.3% from $850,000 a year ago. As John noted earlier, we have a new agreement in place with Microsoft, and our total annualized spend on Dynamics in 2016 will be approximately $4.5 million, compared to last year's spend of approximately 8.4 million. With the shift in focus towards sales, approximately $2.5 million of the expense will remain in R&D, with the balance of $2 million included in SG&A expense. Subscription revenues increased 34.8%, with 30.8% organic growth. We added 65 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 11 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $28.5 million in total contract value. In Q1 of last year, we added 32 new subscription-based arrangements and had 19 on-premises conversions, representing approximately 22.2 million in total contract value. Among the on-premises clients converting to the cloud this quarter were two large school districts, each of which use our Munis ERP software - the Indianapolis public schools in Indiana and the West Contra Costa USD in California. SaaS clients represented approximately 34% of our new software clients in the quarter, compared to 28% in the prior year quarter. SaaS contract value represented 43% of the total new software contract value signed this quarter, and that mix was unchanged from Q1 of 2015. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 5.9 years, compared to 4.9 years in last year's first quarter. Subscription-based revenues from e-filing for courts and online payments increased 23.5%, to $11.9 million, from 9.6 million last year. That amount includes e-filing revenue of $8.9 million this quarter, up 21% over last year. Our GAAP blended gross margin for the quarter declined 150 basis points to 45.8% mainly due to the impact of acquisition-related adjustments to revenue and higher amortization of acquired software related to the New World acquisition. These acquisition-related items negatively impacting gross margin were partially offset by the positive impact of increased services revenues generated as professional services personnel which were on-boarded in the past few quarters continue to become billable. Our non-GAAP gross margin rose 290 basis points to 51.1% primarily from the inclusion of New World, which historically has higher gross margins with a revenue mix that includes a greater proportion of higher-margin maintenance revenues and less lower-margin professional services revenue than Tyler. SG&A expense increased 42.8% and was 22.7% of total revenues, an increase of 160 basis points from last year's first quarter. Excluding non-cash share-based compensation and related expenses, SG&A expense increased 42.6% and was 19.8% of total GAAP revenues, an increase of 130 basis points, and was 19.2% of total non-GAAP revenues, an increase of 70 basis points over last year's first quarter. The increase in SG&A expense is mainly due to the inclusion of New World, which historically ran at a higher SG&A as a percentage of revenue. Also, commission expense increased due to a higher volume of sales compared to the first quarter of last year. GAAP operating income was $28 million, an increase of 3.2%, and was impacted by acquisition-related adjustments to revenue and increased amortization of intangibles, along with higher stock compensation expense. Non-GAAP operating income was 49.1 million, up 48.1%, our non-GAAP operating margin improved by 200 basis points to 26.5%. GAAP net income declined 1.1% to 17.1 million or $0.44 per diluted share. Again, this decline is mainly attributable to the acquisition-related adjustments to revenue and increased amortization of acquired software and other intangibles from the New World acquisition. Non-GAAP net income was 31.3 million or $0.81 per diluted share up 46.5 compared to last year. The fully diluted share count for the quarter increased by approximately 2.7 million shares over Q1 of 2015, primarily from stock issued in acquisitions and to a lesser extent, stock option exercises over the last 12 months, offset somewhat by the recent stock repurchases. In Q1, we repurchased 758,000 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $94.5 million, or an average of $124.75 per share. Cash flow from operations was the higher for a first quarter in the Company's history at $40.3 million. Free cash flow was $23.5 million, compared to negative $4 million in last year's first quarter. New World's operations contributed positively to cash flow with significant maintenance collections in the first quarter. Excluding real estate costs, free cash flow was $33.8 million. In Q1, we purchased for approximately $9.7 million an office facility in Falmouth, Maine, which we had previously leased. We also broke ground on a major expansion of our office in Yarmouth, Maine, to support continued growth in our ERP and schools business unit. That construction will continue through 2017. We ended the quarter with a total of $69 million in cash and liquid investments and debt of $140 million. Day sales outstanding in accounts receivable improved to 69 days at March 31, from 71 days at March 31, 2015. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $808.7 million, up 17.3% from last year's first quarter. Software-related backlog, which excludes backlog from appraisal services contracts, was $763.3 million, a 20.5% increase. Backlog included $191.7 million of maintenance, compared $137.9 million a year ago. Subscription backlog was $250.9 million, compared to $208.4 million last year. Our bookings for the quarter, which are calculated from the change in backlog plus non-GAAP revenues, were approximately $149 million, an increase of 21.1% from Q1 of 2015. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $760 million, a 14.3% increase over the prior period. Appraisal services bookings declined by $13 million from last year's first quarter, which included a $12 million appraisal contract with Franklin County, Ohio. Excluding appraisal services, software related bookings rose 36.8%. On an organic basis, software related bookings, excluding New World and appraisal services, grew 12.3%. Please note that we have posted a spreadsheet detailing our quarterly bookings calculations on the Investor Relations section of our website, at www.tylertech.com/investors, under the Annual Report and Financials tab. We signed 30 new contracts in the first quarter that included software licenses greater than $100,000 and those contracts had an average license of $323,000, compared to 27 new contracts with an average license of $336,000 in the first quarter of 2015. Our updated guidance for the full year of 2016 is as follows, we currently expect 2016 GAAP revenues will be between $750 million and $765 million and non-GAAP revenues will be between $765 million and $780 million. We expect 2016 GAAP diluted EPS will be approximately $1.92 to $2.02. We expect 2016 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be approximately $3.35 to $3.45. For the year, estimated pre-tax non-cash share based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $30 million to $31 million. We expect R&D expense for the year will be approximately $42 million to $44 million. Fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between 38.5 million and 39.5 million shares. The share count is impacted by both the timing and volume of stock option exercises and stock repurchases. We expect the GAAP annual effective tax rate for 2016 will be between 38.0% and 39.5%. The non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 35.5% to 37.0%. The tax rate is affected by the timing and volume of stock option exercises. With the issuance of ASU number 2016-09, compensation - stock compensation topic 718 on March 31, which will require us to recognize the income tax effects of stock option exercises in the income statements, both our GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates could differ substantially from this guidance. We're currently assessing the impact of adopting the new standard, and given the scope of the new standard, we're currently unable to provide a reasonable estimate regarding the financial impact. We expect to adopt this standard in mid to late 2016. We expect our total capital expenditures will be approximately $37 million to $39 million for the year, including approximately $18 million related to real estate. Total depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately 50 million to 51 million, including approximately $36 million as amortization of acquired intangibles. With respect to R&D expense, our previous guidance was for total R&D expense for the year of 46 million to 48 million. While our total expected development spend has not changed significantly, the split between R&D expense and development expense included in cost of revenues has changed, as we have further refined the classification of some of these projects. The amount of development expense recorded as R&D, which is primarily associated with new products, has been reduced by about $4 million for the year, with a similar increase to the development expense included in cost of revenues for the year. Taking into account this reclassification as well as the change in Dynamics R&D spend, our total R&D expense for the year is expected to be between 42 million and 44 million. Now I'd like to turn the call back to John for his further comments.
John Marr: Thanks, Brian. Our market remains very active, and our competitive position in the market continues to be very strong across all our product lines. The pipeline is at historically high levels, local government budgets are generally healthy, and we are not seeing signs of weakness in our space. As we noted earlier, we have modestly raised the lower end of our earnings guidance, reflecting our confidence in our outlook for the year. At this point, New World's operations remain on track to deliver the revenue and earnings contribution that we expected at the beginning of the year. Our balance sheet remains very strong, and our cash flow in Q1 was exceptionally high. We used our cash flow and credit facility to aggressively repurchase our common stock during the quarter, buying almost 2% of our outstanding shares at an average price of just under $125 per share. We currently have 643,000 shares remaining on our repurchase authorization. We're pleased with our progress on the integration of New World's products and operations. I was at the New World Public Safety User's Conference in Phoenix earlier this week, with almost 750 clients attending. There was a high level of enthusiasm around the combination of Tyler and New World with both our employees and clients. Also this week, we launched the Tyler Alliance Initiative to provide a platform through which Tyler clients can share data and communicate more efficiently across jurisdictions to help create safer communities. Tyler Alliance is a component of our strategy to bring more closely together Tyler's public safety and justice solutions, with a goal of providing a unique end-to-end solution from dispatch to disposition. Finally, we're looking forward to hosting 3,000 Tyler clients at Connect 2016, our annual user conference, held May 1st through the 4th in Phoenix. At the conference, we will also host investors and analysts at a session on Monday, May 2, from 10:45 to 12:45 Phoenix time, which is Mountain Standard Time. If you're interested in attending Connect, please contact Brian Miller for more information. A live and archived webcast of the investor session at the - and the accompanying slide deck will also be available at the Investor Relations section of our website. Now, Gail, we'll take questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Charlie Strauzer from CJS Securities. Please go ahead.
Charlie Strauzer: John, Brian, if you could talk a little bit about the pipeline, I know in the release you talked about the pipeline being very active, and when you look at the opportunities and the RPs that are tracking in the pipeline, are there some large opportunities in there for Dynamics as well as New World, or are these still kind of more further down the road?
John Marr: Well, in general, as we said, the bookings and backlog, I think, were pretty strong, probably within a range that someone would expect, in line with our overall growth. Obviously, that is just kind of one piece of the puzzle. Unsigned awards, decisions that are approaching the final stages and our position in those, and the longer-term pipeline are favorable, so as we indicated, the market in general in our view is towards the higher end of historical levels, so that's a good thing. We see it being very healthy. More specifically, in terms of the two you've mentioned, there are a couple of, I guess, meaningful or what will be notable deals in the Dynamics pipeline. Now, there aren't dozens, but there are a couple of those, so we would expect deals that would be worth mentioning specifically as we go through the year and as they work their way through the process. So there's a reasonable amount of activity there, but as it's been, it's not explosive. New World had a number of new public safety deals and a few financial deals in the first quarter, so they continue to go through that. I think the message has been well received. I was part of delivering that on Monday in Phoenix to the public safety group and many clients approached me and other people that participated and said they heard what they wanted to hear, they're excited about it and they look forward to the progress of the different systems. Their overall pipeline, so specifically the overall pipeline in public safety, I would say is not at historically high levels. I don't have as much experience in that space, but according to the New World folks, it's kind of a reasonable market but not particularly hot at the time. They see that picking up a little momentum later in the year.
Operator: The next question comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Patrick Falzon: Hi, this is actually Patrick Falzon on for Kirk. John, has there been any change to your outlook given the economic softness in some of the states with more energy exposure? And then, Brian, if I could just follow up, could you maybe discuss how we should think about the seasonality as it relates to operating margins over the remainder of the year? And is seeing operating margins expand year-over-year as we look out in 2017 a reasonable assumption to work off of?
John Marr: Okay, so the answer to the question from me is no, we haven't seen any deals pulled back or timing delayed or any impact. Generally, the public sector budgets are pretty strong, the activity is good and no, we haven't seen any specific impact from energy related changes.
Brian Miller: On the margin question, we do expect margins to build through the year. We expect that both gross margins and operating margins will be stronger in the second half of the year, particularly on non-GAAP basis. The amortization - or the haircut on the referring revenue starts to narrow, so the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP revenues will narrow through the year. But we would expect that margins would be stronger in the second half of the year than the first half of the year, and obviously I haven't talked much about 2017, but our longer-term expectations for consistent operating margin and gross margin expansion, based on our targeted growth rates, we would expect to see that progression continue into 2017, so those long-term expectations continue to be the same as we've talked about in the past.
Operator: The next question comes from Brian Kinstlinger of Maxim Group. Please go ahead.
Brian Kinstlinger: I wanted to touch on Microsoft. I'm wondering maybe if you could highlight your plan to help them in the sales process. Will you be educating the channel partners? Maybe also what have the existing partners communicated to you as it relates, if at all to you or Microsoft about the slower ramp maybe than everyone might have expected?
John Marr: Yes, so we work closely with the Microsoft folks. I think the initial major development of extending the product for the public sector as well as streamlining of commercial features and functions that the public sector doesn't need, that major build is largely complete, so I think our strategic value we've all seen as shifting. They don't require that kind of resource complement on the R&D side so we'll play a more limited role there.  As we evaluate where we can add value to the relationship, we all feel that that's now on the sales side. Just like the product is different for the vertical and we've been through that development process, the whole market itself the way it behaves the procurement processes, that's different as well and obviously just like we have those subject matter experts at Tyler on the dev side, we have it in the sales channel as well, so using some of our people to assist their partners in building those channels is really where we're focused. And obviously, they're selling through partners and they're not typically software companies, they're typically integrators and they're professional service organizations and they're not typically as strong on the sales and marketing side as a software company like us that's exclusively focused on that space, so we're involved in helping those partners develop their public safety practice. We participate in demonstrations, we participate in proposal generation and basically get them up to speed on working in those spaces. And probably like the dev side eventually they'll be able to work more independently, but right now I think there's a lot of value that Tyler can bring to that process. In terms of expectations and where we are in relation to that, yes I think it's lighter than either of the parties expected initially. As I indicated there are some exciting deals out there. They're not game changers, but certainly meaningful deals where the product, the integrators and our support have competed favorably against the rest of the market, and we'll continue to execute in those opportunities and build
Brian Kinstlinger: Great, the last question I have, can you quantify the percentage of your IC install base that has e-file?
John Marr: Well, the definition of has I guess is --
Brian Kinstlinger: Sorry, using and then has.
John Marr: It would be low. Obviously - and again, is it names or dollars, because Texas is one name but big dollars, but maybe it's somewhere around a third at this point. I see some of the research you guys are publishing that talk about new names, and there will be some new names, obviously, as the year rolls through, but a lot of the growth on the Odyssey side will be back into the base, other products, an integrated criminal justice system rather than maybe just a case management system if it was started that way, other case types, and obviously the big one is building out the e-file. So we have agreements and understandings with many of our clients that that is a big part of what they want to accomplish in their relationship with us, but it's relatively low in terms of those that are fully implemented and the revenue run rates are up where they would be in a fully implemented system.
Operator: The next question comes from Jonathan Ho of William Blair & Company. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Ho: I just wanted to start out with one of the comments that you made last quarter around New World maybe being a little bit slower getting out of the gate. Did we see any deals from last quarter maybe slip into this quarter and help on the booking side relative to New World?
John Marr: Nothing meaningful, obviously, there's always deals moving around from a timing standpoint, but, no, nothing really meaningful.
Jonathan Ho: Okay. And then just given the high percentage of SaaS deals that were elected this quarter, how should we think about the trend? Are you starting to see sort of an inflection point here? I just want to get an understanding of where you see that going for the balance of the year.
John Marr: Maybe is the answer. We do see in probably this quarter, in the deals that are far enough along to know, whether or not we're likely to be selected and which type of deployment they'll choose. It does remain elevated, but whether or not that's a trend and a permanent uptick, it's probably still a little early to say, but no question, in Q1 it was higher, and we do have some visibility on it remaining higher in the next quarter or two, let's say.
Brian Miller: I think a couple of trends we are seeing more of with respect to the SaaS bookings is that we're seeing it being adopted more broadly across our product lines as opposed to just in the ERP space, so we're seeing more Odyssey deals primarily at the lower end, but Odyssey deals. We're seeing more appraisal and tax deals, EnerGov deals, so it's more broad, the adoption across our product lines, than it was going back three or four years ago. And we're certainly seeing more larger deals coming in on the SaaS side. So not necessarily the percentage of the number of deals, but whereas if you go back a few years, it was mostly on the small end. For example, this quarter, the biggest deal of the quarter with Milwaukee was a SaaS deal, so we are seeing more on the high end. And thirdly, longer terms, so that certainly increases the contract value that we book, but I think customers, as they become more comfortable with the offerings are certainly signing up for longer initial terms.
Operator: The next question comes from Tim Klasell of Northern Securities. Please go ahead.
Tim Klasell: I just wanted to drill in a little bit on the longer terms and the longer duration that you mentioned earlier in the call. Are there any particular products where the customers are getting more comfortable or more committed upfront, like the ERP or is there - I don't know, is there any pattern that you can share with us?
John Marr: I don't think particularly across products. I think it's more a progression that when we first started doing SaaS hosted deals 13 or 14 years ago, they were all three-year initial terms, and now I'd say the standard would be five and certainly a lot of sevens and some as long as ten years, so I think it's a combination of the market or our market becoming more comfortable with the SaaS offering in general and our history and reputation in providing that, that customers are they expect to use these systems for a very long time, and they're comfortable committing to a longer term upfront. I don't think it varies a lot by product.
Tim Klasell: Okay, good. Good. And then going back to your comment about public safety not being particularly hot, should we expect seasonality? Is that just sort of how that market works, or maybe it was the New World acquisition that sort of maybe disrupted things? Maybe you can walk us through that maybe in a little bit more detail.
John Marr: They do seem to have stronger activity late in the year, but no, I don't think this is a function of this acquisition, this is an observation of the market in general and that the activity in the market in general at this point in time by historical standards, seems marginally light. It's nothing I'd read into too dramatically, but it's just not a particularly fat pipeline at this point in time. They see names coming into the pipeline later in the year, so there isn't a real concern about the activity long term. But just the snapshot at this point in time, which will impact the deal flow over the next couple of quarters, isn't all that robust.  Quite frankly, that can work well for us. I think the message has been well received. I think the vision that Tyler has for a fully integrated criminal justice system is easy to understand and clearly makes sense and adds incremental value to what's existed in the marketplace but, I think it's a good thing that we're able to refine that message and actually deliver certain things that are encouraging about what we're trying to achieve there and be in a stronger competitive position as the deal flow picks up again, so that's what we're busy doing right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Pete Heckmann of Avondale Partners. Please go ahead.
Pete Heckmann: I'm having a little trouble finding this worksheet that you mentioned, and just so maybe you can help me a little bit, could you give us New World's bookings for the quarter and then as well, on a similar basis as you present it for the quarter? I think that's helpful to look at organic software bookings. Do you have that on a trailing 12 months basis?
Brian Miller: Yes, New World's bookings for the quarter were about $20 million, and organic software bookings were, let's see, about $41 million. So that's software and services excluding, software and services, and then subscription bookings on an organic basis were $42 million.
Pete Heckmann: Okay, great and so I'll track that worksheet down and then a second question, could you just give us an update on progress in California, if there's been any new developments with additional counties, and perhaps any update in terms of how you see that state evolving from an e-filing standpoint over the next two years?
John Marr: We don't expect and didn't experience a tremendous amount of new client activity there. I think that largely the big wave of people that had to do things following the change in direction out there has occurred. As I indicated earlier, there is a lot of opportunity expanding those relationships too. If they started on a narrow footprint in terms of case types and applications expanding it to include a more integrated criminal justice system and other case types, so that's the plan. In terms of e-filing, some of them - there is a little bit of e-filing going on actively right now. A number have contracts with us and are in the process to bring that up and online, but regardless of the contractual relationship, it's our expectation that the vast majority of those counties have every intention of doing e-filing after they bring their case management systems online.
Pete Heckmann: Okay. And in terms of timeline, would you think that's a 2017 or 2018 item?
John Marr: I would think it's as much as a three or four year process and that you'll see progress throughout that period of time, that quarter-by-quarter and year-by-year, more and more clients and more and more volume will go through there, so it'll be a gradual build.
Brian Miller: We do have three or four California counties that start to come online in the second half of the year with e-filing revenues. I don't believe they're mandatory so the numbers are relatively small, but throughout this year, I think Santa Clara County, San Diego County, looks like Orange County all will start to generate some e-filing revenues in the second half of the year.
Operator: The next question comes from Zach Cummins with B. Riley & Company. Please go ahead.
Zach Cummins: So can you go ahead and talk about the current capacity of your sales team and its ability to support new or old systems and all its public safety initiatives?
John Marr: The sales team, I think our capacity has been strong, and it is - we don't add that many heads. Really, we don't have much turnover at all and I think that the individual people there, their abilities to manage high levels of business develops as the Company grows, so it's actually surprising to me the request for heads is low relative to the growth. So I think there's a lot of capacity in the sales and you won't see significant jumps in headcount there even as the business grows. Our ability to handle the New World business, there may be an assumption there that's not correct. So Tyler's existing sales channel won't have direct responsibilities to selling those products. We will continue to use what were existing New World resources to do that, and so those sales channels are in place. There's a lot of coordination going on on both sides, both of the product sides, between Tyler's channels and theirs. There are some leadership positions where we've moved Tyler people into those channels to maybe Tyler-ize to some degree and create a best of both worlds channel. But again, the feet on the street are largely the same people that were in place at New World before, and they'll, again, grow below in line with the overall growth of the Company, because I think the capacity has some leverage in it.
Zach Cummins: Great. Thank you. That was really helpful. And in the Q4 call, you talked about some prior New World customers that were still undecided when Tyler acquired New World. I was wondering if you could give us kind of an update on if some of those customers decided to remain with Tyler or kind of what the whole dynamic was there?
John Marr: Well, there hasn't been any attrition caused, and even if the client base wasn't pleased with this decision, which isn't the case again, I was at the public safety conference Monday, and it was very positive and very enthusiastic, so it may not mean that every single client is excited about this, but it is generally being received very positively. But obviously, even if somebody didn't like it, it takes a long time to change, right? You need to spin up a process to go acquire a new system, implement it. That's at least a two-year process, so you wouldn't see any attrition at this point in time, but we don't expect that this deal is going to trigger attrition. I think this deal is breathing enthusiasm into their relationships. I believe they genuinely understand Tyler's interest in the business, and we've added you saw this last quarter. We talked about increases in R&D and service, 62 new heads in the plan for the year rather than what could have been heads that were dropped as cost synergies in the deal, so I think that's really clear to their base, and they're excited and enthusiastic about it.
Brian Miller: And to the extent there were prospects that were in the pipeline that were close to a decision around the time the acquisition was announced, we talked on the fourth quarter call about, as we expected, there were some delays not talking about a lot of people, but at least a handful of deals that were in that stage where they stepped back to be sure they understood what the impact of the acquisition was, and I don't think we've had any significant surprises there. Again, we're talking about maybe a large handful of deals and there have probably been a couple on the ERP side that were deciding between the New World product and the Tyler product, so if they went with the Tyler product, that's still in our family. I don't think we've lost any deals on the public safety side because of the acquisition. So no real surprises there and that as we expected, all kind of gets back on track after a quarter or so.
Operator: The next question comes from John Rizzuto of SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: This is [Indiscernible] sitting in for John. I had a few questions, and the first one maybe you talked about how your SaaS business potentially could be on the verge of acceleration. As you think about it accelerating, what do you think is the impact that happens to revenue and margins if that does happen in a sustained way?
John Marr: Well, if you could design the rate at which SaaS has been embraced by our marketplace and our existing customers, I think a real, what we're experiencing is very consistent with exactly what we'd want. We're clearly transitioning into a strong SaaS player. Clients in that space that want cloud-based solutions but also want proven software specifically designed for that vertical and the service providers and the rest of our message can get it. They don't need to go to the new vendors that maybe are good cloud players but don't have that track record on the software and service side, so it's progressing well. I don't see the acceleration being so explosive that you're going to hear from us that it's impacting our growth rate meaningfully or our margins meaningfully. It's swinging from 15 to 20, and now it's up in the low 30s for a few quarters. Even if it stays there, which would be great, I don't think you'll hear us saying that that's put pressure on our revenue growth or our margins in a meaningful way. Does it change it within a particular quarter 50 or 100 basis points, sure it could, but I don't see some substantial change in growth or margins because of the lumpiness of the traction that SaaS and cloud solutions have.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, good. That's helpful. And then the second one is around basically how the government and local government market - at least it's remained healthy, like you're not really seeing any impact from, let's say the energy things, but as you think about it and the (ph) maybe just move to the cloud, what factors do you think that you could think about could potentially drive an acceleration in this market as you look forward?
John Marr: Well, there's a few and they've all been around, in general, I think government and local government is always going to be more cautious and slower to embrace new technology and new deliverables than the commercial industry, and so we've seen that here. So it's a slower evolution in our space, and so it's gaining momentum maybe later than it did in other verticals or other industries, so we're seeing some of that so that would be one. The other drivers though, really often have to do with their resources, so often moving to the cloud can have to do with the brain drain of people retiring or moving on and now they want to go to a trusted partner or provider rather than recruit and train new resources that it's difficult to do competing with the commercial sector. And the third one really is investment and infrastructure, so if they've got a current investment in their own technology and that's serving them well, they're not going to be anxious to move to the cloud. As that technology ages and is less competitive, that's something that can be a catalyst for a city or a school or a court to look at moving to the cloud. So I'd say those three things generally are the catalysts that cause people to move to the cloud in our space.
Unidentified analyst : Okay, thanks. And then just one last one, on your capital allocation, you've got - I guess generally speaking, your CapEx is kind of heading up but you also are buying back more shares of things. Is that kind of - could you just update us what you plan to do with the cash just in general?
John Marr: Well in terms of CapEx, it is elevated this year but again, half of it is real estate related, so we will invest in and own our major facilities when it makes sense, and there were a couple opportunities to do that this year so, I don't see that happening on a regular basis, we built the Plano facility a couple of years ago, we built the facility in Lubbock a few years before that, and New World had just bought and redone a significant facility. This will give us a lot of growth opportunity in our main areas. So I don't see a major real estate investment at those levels in the next few years after this, so that's kind of a one-timer thing. Another significant growth in our CapEx, which is a good thing and will continue, is in our technology facilities for hosting cloud solutions, so that's a change over the years and that's becoming significant as that growth is significant. So there is higher CapEx related to cloud if you host your own facilities than there was in our traditional on-premise business, so that's more permanent. Our regular PT&E CapEx remains very low. It's 120 basis points, 150 basis points on revenues, so it's a very low capital intensive business other than again, investing in cloud and from time to time investing in real estate. In terms of the buy back, I guess you can tell the way we look at our stock. We bought some stock in the 130's, and we bought, I think, quite aggressively in the mid to low 120's, and so that was attractive to us given our long-term outlook and we were very aggressive, and we'd be pleased to do it again, although certainly we won't cause the stock to go to that area, but if market conditions do, we would be aggressive and we don't give specific numbers, it's an active process to look at those values but, over time I'm sure those numbers will come up or our targets will come up somewhat.  We're investing at a pretty significantly higher level in our own products, so that is not CapEx. We don't capitalize any software development. It runs through our P&L, so that does put some pressure on earnings but when we look at the opportunities and the significant cash we'll generate in the coming years, we see reinvesting in our own business as a very attractive way to deploy that capital and you'll see us do some of that. I don't think - again, this was a year where we ratcheted that up pretty significantly. I don't think you'll see us telling you every year that that's putting pressure on margins, but certainly we'll actively look for opportunities to invest in our own products and improve their competitive position.
Operator: The next question comes from Patrick Walravens of JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
Patrick Walravens: So two quick questions, one is if you could comment on the competitive environment and whether you're seeing any changes there or there is any new potential entrants, and then secondly, just on your pipeline commentary, when was the last time that you felt the pipeline was a little light like this? Thank you very much.
John Marr: I don’t see real new entrants and I don't expect that. It is a major investment to enter any of these areas of the business. There are mature, established players in all of these areas of the business, and I just think if someone's looking for a place to make a significant investment, the thresholds to establishing yourself in this space are very significant, very obvious, and I just don't expect to see a lot of new names. We see our existing competitors flow in and out. I would say that happens. So they're, and I don't comment on specific names, so I'll not do that, but certainly some of these competitors become a little less competitive and some of them eventually become legacy players, but some of them say hey, we need to do some of what Tyler does and reinvest in their product or reinvest in their channel and become stronger competitively. So I think sometimes, because our market shares are very strong and we do feel we have a strong position, in this market, people think it's a little more automatic than it is. And so there's no question there are good competitors there, their competitive positions, like ours, flow within certain ranges, and that's what we deal with on a day in and day out basis, but not really any new clients in that space. In terms of a light pipeline, I want to clarify that. The pipeline in general we believe is strong. We believe the marketplace in general is, if you were to bracket the normal experience, it's on the higher end or the more active end of what is typical in this space. Specifically, I said that the public safety side, from what those folks who are more experienced and have more history in that area report to us, is a little bit lighter than would be typical at this point in a year, and their visibility suggests that that's temporary and they expect it to recover later in the year.
Patrick Walravens: Okay. Have you ever seen that before? Is there a time you've seen that before?
John Marr: I've not been in this space before. This is public safety. Specifically, we had a very small presence there. Based on, again, what they're telling us and their history, which is good, this is just, it's a little lighter than it normally is, it's not like - it's terribly weak, and that's really all we know at this point.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from George Prince of RBC. Please go ahead.
George Prince: Can you talk a little bit about the cross-selling opportunity, maybe what you define as cross-selling, what percentage of your business you're currently doing cross-selling, and what the potential is?
John Marr: I don't know if I have percentages for you, George, but…
George Prince: Ballpark is fine.
John Marr: Yes. But there are a number of places where it's pretty productive right now. Probably the most productive area is EnerGov. So EnerGov, when we bought them, we kept their direct sales channel in that space, and so if a large county comes out for their solutions, they handle that as they did before on a direct basis, but we also trained our other sales channels on their products, product presentation, and so we do what is a lot of incremental business through our other sales channels, I guess a lot of it through the Munis sales channel.  A lot of their solutions include EnerGov now, and it's a pretty big-ticket item. So if they sell a 500,000 Munis license, it might drag a 200,000 license for EnerGov, so that would be an example where it's very active and it's very incremental and it also improves our competitive position, so you'll never know for certain, but that could've been a deal that maybe Munis wouldn't have won without it, so all good stuff and all the kinds of things we're trying to accomplish with those types of acquisitions. On our criminal justice side, now, which we've talked a lot about our objectives there, which we'll deliver a solution that's different than exists in that marketplace, so, and it isn't just the big ticket items, so New World's public safety and obviously our Odyssey system, as they combine and will drive synergies there, but the SoftCode solution that we acquired a couple of years ago is in this whole alliance, the Brazos system, which is mobile devices and applications in the field. That's a lot of potential. So it's happening. It helps in a lot of ways, obviously, this incremental revenue. It improves the competitiveness of the core system by adding on these other extensions, and we do see more of it. If you look historically at Tyler, we have this broad offering that really nobody else has, but we have focused on those individual applications individually in this call it's the first phase of Tyler's product strategy. The next phase of the strategy does have a lot more focus on building horizontal, use of these different applications, adding benefits and value to using multiple products, and so we talked about, I think last quarter creating an incremental R&D team that's led by Jeff Green, that focuses on those synergies, and there's a lot of that now so that it's not just having two products from the Tyler family, but really being able to specifically identify tangible advantages to having multiple Tyler suites.
Operator: At this time, there appears to be no more questions. Mr. Marr, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.
John Marr: Okay. Well, thank you Gail, and thanks everybody for joining us on today's call. If you do have any further questions, feel free to reach out to Brian or myself. Thanks again. Have a good day.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Brian. The fourth quarter was certainly eventful with our acquisition of New World Systems Corporation, completed on November 16. New World is a leading provider of public safety and financial solutions for local governments, and brings an important element to our portfolio of solutions. Founded in 1981 and based in Troy, Michigan, New World has over 2,000 public sector customers and more than 470 employees. New World Systems is highly complementary to Tyler, and the combination supports our strategy of being an industry leader in all major enterprise applications essential to local government. The purchase price was $360 million in cash, which was funded from cash on hand and proceeds from a new revolving credit facility, and 2.1 million shares of Tyler's common stock, making this the largest acquisition in Tyler's history by a wide margin. The integration of New World's operations and products with Tyler is well under way and, as you can imagine, is a major effort and will continue through this year. Our combined employee and client groups are enthusiastic about the addition of New World to the Tyler family and the opportunities that the combination provides. The acquisition also introduces a certain amount of noise to our fourth quarter result as well as to our outlook for 2016, with acquisition-related expenses and adjustments, as well as accounting changes to conform New World to Tyler's policies and practices. We'll try to identify and quantify those items as we discuss our results, although our guidance for 2016 assumes revenues from New World of approximately $124 million, which is a lower first-year contribution than we projected when the acquisition was announced. Since the deal closed, we have become more excited about the acquisition and the long-term opportunities it brings. Excluding New World, the midpoint of our revenue guidance infers organic growth of approximately 12% for 2016, and the high end would have organic growth of approximately 13%. We are pleased with our solid performance in the fourth quarter, with organic revenue growth of 15.3%, our ninth straight quarter of revenue growth greater than 15%. In total, non-GAAP revenue growth was 27.2%. Not surprisingly, we have seen some decisions delayed, as prospects get comfortable with the acquisition. Tyler has a strong commitment to New World clients to support and enhance their products for the long term, as we have with previous acquisitions. And they should be confident that Tyler will be a strong partner for them. Continued strong growth in our e-filing revenues from courts, as well as a gradual shift to cloud-based software-as-a-service business, led to 29% growth in our recurring revenues from subscriptions. With the addition of New World, year-end backlog grew 20% over last year. Bookings for the quarter rose 13.5% and including approximately $23 million from New World. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were up 3.3%. The comparison to last year is a difficult one, because in Q2 of 2014 it included $64 million related to contract signings with California courts. Excluding the California courts contracts, the trailing 12-month bookings rose 15%. Q4 was another very strong quarter for SaaS contracts with total contract value of $32.4 million, the highest quarter ever. Our largest new contract signed in the fourth quarter was a 10-year SaaS agreement, valued at approximately $8.4 million with the City of Raleigh for our EnerGov Solutions, which continues to have success in the marketplace. The City of Burnaby in British Columbia, Canada also signed an on-premise agreement with EnerGov, valued at approximately $3.4 million. We signed two significant SaaS contracts in Texas for our Odyssey Solution. The first was a five-year SaaS arrangement with Wichita County valued at approximately $4.7 million, and the second with Hunt County valued at approximately $3.4 million. In addition, we signed new E-File agreements with the State of Idaho and Orange County, California Superior Courts. For our New World Public Safety solution, we signed significant license arrangements with the City of Casa Grande, Arizona; Indiana County Emergency Management in Pennsylvania, and Statesville, North Carolina. Also for our New World ERP solution, we signed license agreements with Gerald R. Ford International Airport in Michigan and Fayetteville, Georgia. We signed several notable SaaS contracts for our Munis ERP solution, including San Juan County, New Mexico, Knox County Schools in Tennessee, and Marietta City Schools in Georgia. We also signed significant new on-premise contracts for Munis with the cities of Glendale, Santa Monica, and Simi Valley, California; Manassas, Virginia; Greenville County, South Carolina; and Las Cruces, New Mexico. Finally, for our appraisal and tax iasWorld solution, we signed a notable license agreement with Sussex County, Delaware. Now, I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and provide our annual guidance for 2016.
Brian K. Miller - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer: Thanks, John. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2015. I'm going to provide some additional data on the quarter's performance and review our guidance for 2016, and then John will have some additional comments on the quarter and our outlook for 2016. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. These measures include write-downs of acquisition-related deferred revenue and acquired leases, share-based compensation expense, the employer portion of payroll taxes on employee stock transactions, acquisition-related costs, and amortization of acquired intangibles. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. Revenues for the fourth quarter were $158.9 million, up 24.7% with 15.3% organic growth. Software license and royalty revenues increased 15.2%. This was our 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in licenses. Organic license growth was approximately 1.1%. In Q4, we received $319,000 of royalties on public sector sales of Microsoft Dynamics AX by other Microsoft VARs, down 63.8% from $881,000 a year ago. For the full year, we received $3.4 million, an increase of 12.4% compared to $3 million in 2014. Subscription revenues increased 29.3% with 26.6% organic growth. We added 33 new subscription-based arrangements and converted nine existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $32.4 million in total contract value. This represents our highest quarter ever for SaaS bookings. In Q4 of last year, we added 24 new subscription-based arrangements and had 12 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $31 million in total contract value. SaaS clients represented approximately 22% of our new software clients in the quarter, compared to 17% in the prior-year quarter. SaaS contract value represented 49% of total new software contract value signed this quarter, compared to 39% in Q4 of 2014. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 6.6 years compared to 6.4 years in last year's fourth quarter. Subscription-based revenues from e-filing for courts and online payments increased 28.3% to $11.3 million from $8.8 million last year. Total e-filing revenue of $8.6 million this quarter increased 28% over last year. Our GAAP blended gross margin for the quarter declined 140 basis points to 46.1%, mainly due to the impact of acquisition-related write-downs of deferred revenue and increased amortization of acquired software. Our non-GAAP gross margin rose by 130 basis points to 49.6%. SG&A expense increased 51.1% and was 26.7% of total revenues, an increase of 460 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. Excluding non-cash share-based compensation and related expenses and acquisition-related cost, SG&A expense increased 27.3% and was 19.6% of total revenues. For the full year, SG&A expense, excluding non-cash share-based compensation and related expenses and acquisition-related cost, increased 14.8% and was 18.5% of total revenues, an improvement of 80 basis points over 2014. GAAP operating income was $19.8 million, a decrease of 19.6%. Non-GAAP operating income was $40.7 million, up 33.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin improved 120 basis points to 25.1%. GAAP net income declined 43.7% to $8.6 million or $0.23 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $22.4 million or $0.59 per diluted share, up 16.3% compared to $19.3 million or $0.54 per diluted share in Q4 of last year. The fully diluted share count for the quarter increased by approximately 2.2 million shares, primarily form stock issued in acquisitions and to a lesser extent, stock option exercises. Our effective tax rate for Q4 was 55.9%, as we cumulatively adjusted the annual rate to 40.2% from the 36.7% tax rate we were estimating through Q3. This obviously represents a significant increase from our expectations at the beginning of the quarter. The increase in the effective tax rate primarily reflects the tax implications of the very high level of stock option exercises by employees in the quarter, as those create a limitation on certain tax deductions, and therefore, negatively impact our effective tax rate. When options are exercised in full, the employee recognizes ordinary income for which we receive a cash tax benefit. However, this gain creates a limitation on certain deductions that, in turn, increases our book tax rate. The timing and the amount of stock option exercises is difficult to predict and could result in some volatility in our rate as we saw this quarter. The effective tax rate was also negatively impacted by certain non-deductible acquisition-related costs. Had our annual effective tax rate stayed at the 36.7% we were estimating at the end of the third quarter, non-GAAP EPS would have been $2.64 for the year or $0.10 higher. Free cash flow was $20.7 million compared to $27 million in last year's fourth quarter. Cash flow for the quarter was impacted by approximately $5.5 million in acquisition-related costs. Also, a significant amount of New World's maintenance billings take place in the fourth quarter, with more than $15 million billed post-acquisition, which increased our receivables balance at yearend that should enhance first quarter cash flow. We also ended the year with a $21 million federal tax receivable as the result of tax payments made early in the year before we knew the extent of excess benefits from option exercises. This will reduce our cash tax payments in 2016. Days sales outstanding and accounts receivable were 101 days at December 31 compared to 80 days at December 31, 2014. DSOs increased sequentially from 77 days at September 30, mainly due to the impact on the DSO calculation of only including seven weeks of post-acquisition revenues from New World but including all of their outstanding accounts receivable at December 31. Excluding New World, DSOs were 80 days at December 31, unchanged from last year. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $844.5 million, a new high, and was up 20.3% from last year's fourth quarter, including approximately $83.2 million of New World backlog. Software-related backlog, which excludes backlog from appraisal services contracts, was $797 million, a 21.2% increase. Backlog included $216.6 million of maintenance compared to $157.8 million a year ago. Subscription backlog was $242 million compared to $205.5 million last year. Our bookings for the quarter, which are calculated from the change in backlog plus revenues, were approximately $176 million, an increase of 13.5% from Q4 of 2014. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $664 million, a 3.3% increase from 2014. Q4 includes New World's estimated bookings from the date acquisition to December 31 of approximately $23 million. As John mentioned earlier, the full-year comparison to 2014 is a difficult one because Q2 of 2014 included bookings of approximately $64 million related to contract signings with California courts. Excluding the California courts contracts, bookings for the trailing 12-months rose 14.9%. We signed 30 new contracts in the fourth quarter that included software licenses greater than $100,000 and those contracts had an average license of $349,000 compared to 35 new contracts with an average license value of $469,000 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Our guidance for the full year of 2016 is as follows: we currently expect 2016 GAAP revenues will be between $750 million and $765 million and non-GAAP revenues will be between $765 million and $780 million; we expect 2016 GAAP diluted EPS will be approximately $1.90 to $2.02; we expect 2016 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be approximately $3.33 to $3.45. For the year, estimated pre-tax non-cash share based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $30 million to $31 million. We expect R&D expense for the year will be approximately $46 million to $48 million, fully diluted shares for the year expected to be 38.5 million and 39.5 million shares. We estimate the annual effective tax rate for 2016 will be between 38% and 39.5%. The tax rate and share count each are affected by the timing and volume of stock option exercises. We expect our total capital expenditures will be approximately $31 million to $33 million for the year, including approximately $10 million related to real estate. Total depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $49 million to $50 million, including approximately $36 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Now, I'd like to turn the call back to John for his further comments.
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Brian. At a macro level, activity in our market remains good and our competitive position continues to be very strong. The pipeline is generally at a very high level. Local government budgets are healthy. And we are not seeing any signs of broad spending slowdown in our space. As you can see, our guidance for 2016 is below consensus and with respect to both revenues and EPS. When the acquisition was announced last fall, our 2016 revenue expectations for New World was around $134 million. We now expect that their 2016 revenue contribution will be about $124 million. The $10 million reduction in revenue reduces our EPS expectations by about $0.10. There are two main reasons for the differences. First, changes to conform New World's revenue recognition to Tyler's practices, our expected results and slower revenue recognition of both licenses and services reducing 2016 revenue by $3 million to $4 million. This is just a difference in timing of revenues. Second, we now expect it will be a little slower getting out of the blocks with New World's growth, and therefore, have lowered our expectations for 2016. We carried a somewhat lighter pipeline into the year, and the process of strengthening the sales channel, integrating products, and ramping up cross-selling all are under way but unlikely to drive significant revenue growth in 2016. We are putting in place the foundation with our organization and products to enable New World to grow at a rate consistent with Tyler's overall growth rates. We consider any revenues from business acquired within the last year to be inorganic. Therefore, about half of New World's revenues in Q4 of next year will be considered organic as will some of the amount of Brazos' revenues in the first half of the year. Using the midpoint of our guidance range and our current expectations to New World's revenues, our 2016 non-GAAP organic revenue growth rate would be around 12% at the midpoint of our guidance range and a little over 13% at the high end. We have consistently talked about our target organic growth rate in the 12% to 14% range, and we've achieved that as an average over more than a decade. In the last couple of years, we have grown above that target rate. A variety of factors have contributed to that higher growth rate, including our success in California courts and some large E-File opportunities. There will be other catalysts to elevate growth at times, but not every year. Our core business is strong, the market is active, and our long-term growth expectations have not changed. We expect our 2016 R&D expense will be approximately $47 million, compared to Tyler's R&D expenses of about $30 million in 2015. After offsetting an expected reduction in Microsoft Dynamics' R&D spend, 2016 includes about $12 million of incremental R&D expense. Investment in New World Public Safety will account for a significant portion of the increase but the investment is across Tyler's products, including a newly created Corporate R&D Group. In total, we expect to increase our R&D staff by about 65 heads compared to last year's level. We continuously evaluate opportunities to put our capital to work, including M&A activities and investment in our products. While we expect to continue to evaluate acquisitions, it is unlikely we'll do another large acquisition while we're digesting New World. As we have studied our near-term opportunities, we believe that investing in Tyler through accelerated R&D spend will provide a compelling long-term return. We have made the decision to fund more development projects this year than previously planned which we believe will strengthen our competitive position across our product lines, allow us to widen the moat between ourselves and competitors and in particular, expand our position in the public safety market. As you know, we expense all of our R&D. So, increasing the spend directly affects EPS. We look at this as an investment, somewhat like making a $12 million acquisition, but doing it internally. In some ways, making the investment internally is more certain than M&A. Again, this is not to say we won't do additional acquisitions, but in the near term, we intend to focus on investing more directly in Tyler organically. Now, we'll take your questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from Patrick Falzon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Kirk Materne - Evercore: Hi. It's actually Kirk Materne with Evercore. Thanks for the additional commentary on the New World acquisition, John. I guess, maybe the first question I have is just on the change in the revenue expectations. I think you mentioned about a half of it was just a rev rec timing. The other half, I think, you mentioned earlier in your prepared remarks, there are some positive as people sort of get their arms – or customers get their arms around sort of what this means for them. I guess, two questions around that. One, do you feel comfortable that after a pause in sort of the first half of the year, things will start to accelerate? And then, I guess, two, does the New World acquisition have any impact on sort of the organic Tyler sort of sales motion? Meaning, I understand sort of the pause from a New World customer perspective but from a core Tyler Technology customer, are they taking a step back and evaluating what New World means for them as well?
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. But probably, I will start with your – their reduction. It's probably almost a third. So, a third maybe rev rec, maybe a little more than a third. And we had some of that built in, but it turns out to be more than we thought. A thirdish is probably slowing down some sales processes and people getting more comfortable with this. And then, a third, I would say, this is new to us, but they would be telling us that their pipe is a little lighter than the last few years. So, again, it's no one significant issue. But a few different things putting some pressure on their revenues. We did as we indicated and as you asked. We feel better about the long-term potential of certainly the Public Safety side of New World now than we did at the time we did the acquisition. We're very impressed with the team. They're very easily blending into Tyler, very similar cultures in ways of operating. They're enthusiastic to be part of Tyler. We feel with these investments that we're teeing up now that we can improve this product competitively, and we think the combined story of New World and Tyler will be more compelling than New World was on its own. So, we're very enthusiastic about that long term, but as we indicated, it can be a little bit slower out of the blocks for those three different reasons. In terms of Tyler, no, there's no impact on Tyler's decisions because we did a large acquisition or there's any confusion in the product strategy. I don't know of any indication for any instance where one of our own organic fields was affected by the acquisition.
Kirk Materne - Evercore: Okay. And just a really quick one on sort of the increase in R&D sort of investment, I think makes a ton of sense.
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah.
Kirk Materne - Evercore: I guess after we get through sort of the step function up this year, does the opportunity for EBITDA growth of, sort of, I guess 20% where it's been over the last few years.
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Right.
Kirk Materne - Evercore: Does that come back into play, or is this something where you just need – you may be investing a little bit – not as much as you should be? I guess, I'm trying to get a sense on what sort of EBITDA growth trend should be after we sort of normalize this uptick in spending this year. Thanks.
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Yeah. Fair enough. And I have to be a little careful, right, answering that question because we clearly want to remain in a position to have the flexibility to make good investments that we feel are compelling. And I could tell you, don't worry, next year they'll rebound, and we'd find a great opportunity that we will invest in and we'll do that. I know you'd want us to do that. So you have to be a little careful about how you answer that question. So, I guess, I'd say it this way. We definitely expect that as our company grows, that the benefit of the scale that we realize will drive margins higher. I don't have any question about that in the long term, but I actually will be pleased to find other opportunities where we feel if we make an R&D investment, it'll give us a great return in the future and we'll literally look for those and make those investments. But in the long term, yes, we expect those investments to drive revenues higher, and the typical model and scale benefits will kick in, and then margins will expand. As we said, we expense all of this, but we look at this as an important investment in building a new data center, which is capitalized, or doing a major acquisition. But it obviously runs through the P&L. I would estimate – and we look at it this way that of the $47 million R&D spend, about half of that, maybe a little more, is what I would call discretionary, competitive investment. So, if you were trying to run the company right now to maximize its current earnings, taking care of all of the deliverables you need for your contracts and customer work, and even doing the core maintenance for the product that you need to do, I think there's a $25 million spend on top of that. That is a great investment to Tyler but is discretionary and really used to be the catalyst for growth down the road. And you guys can kind of look at that and model it as you'd like.
Kirk Materne - Evercore: Thanks, John. Appreciate it.
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure.
Operator: The next question comes from Alex Zukin with Stephens. Please go ahead.
Alex Zukin - Stephens, Inc.: Hey, guys. So two questions for me. The first around the software and services backlog. On an organic basis, it looks like it's basically flat with the prior year, and it hasn't been that way since 2012 I believe. So I'm just wondering if you could shed some light on that around the puts and takes there.
Brian K. Miller - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer: Well, I think, it is relatively flat this quarter. I think most – we have seen more of an increase on the subscription side. The last couple of quarters have been very strong on the subscription booking side. So I think some of that is offset by an increase in the subscription bookings and backlog. So that's probably the major impact there. There's probably also a little bit of an impact from how the New World acquisition fits into that. But I think the biggest change is through the subscription side, the growth there.
Alex Zukin - Stephens, Inc.: Got it. And then what about just if you look at it on a total backlog nature, it's up about – or on an organic basis, up about 8%. Was there any kind of puts and takes in terms of the quarterly volatility in that metric that put it at that level? Was that a level that you came in happy with? Maybe just that one.
Brian K. Miller - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer: I don't think there's anything particularly unusual in there. This quarter, as we talked about frequently, the timing of large deals affects that. This quarter, there weren't any sort of mega-deals. So it seemed to be a pretty normal quarter in terms of bookings. I think, as I said, a very strong quarter on the SaaS side; and kind of an average quarter, actually down a little bit from last year's quarter on the license side. But all in all, nothing remarkable about it. Just kind of a normal bookings quarter, activity and pipeline remained strong. And as John noted, I think we have seen some delays in new signings on the New World side, particularly in the first quarter after the acquisition, and that's not surprising. And I think if it were a normalized quarter for New World bookings, we would have seen more growth there.
Alex Zukin - Stephens, Inc.: Got it. That's helpful. And then, John, how would you characterize the core RFP pipeline for Tyler going into 2016 versus maybe going into the last two years? And then can you just also talk about – is there a little bit of a heightened level of conservatism in the guidance?
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think – okay. In terms of the RFP activity, as we've kind of said, there's nothing here unusual. All the leading indicators are pretty consistent over the last two years or three years since the recovery from the bumps in 2009, 2010, 2011, whatever. Nothing different there. Really nothing different in our core business. I think the activity toward the end of the year in some divisions, particularly Munis for example, the amount of business that kind of uncontracted, not in backlog, so backlog's a little flat, a lot of that's timing. And there were a lot of awards that weren't contracted in the quarter that will get contracted in the first quarter. So that core flow is very normal and something we're pretty satisfied with. I think our growth will come from continuing to improve our competitive position in that situation.
Alex Zukin - Stephens, Inc.: Got it. And just maybe the conservatism around the guidance.
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, maybe a little. I think over the years, most of the things that happen that are surprising affect you in a downward way during the year, right? They guide some expenses you didn't see or some revenue slips. And most of the good things that happen, it takes a little longer to recognize that revenue and get the upside. So I think, sure, over the year, management has learned that and has become a little bit more conservative. And I think we used to probably deliver more in the mid or low end of the range, and I think in recent years we've delivered in no certainty, but delivered on the high or outside the high end of the range. And so that's been an evolution of Tyler I think is accurate. In terms of New World, I just think there's an awful lot of moving parts. There's a lot of noise. And so we're taking a little more conservative position now, which I think is appropriate. And the net of it is what we've tried to do is give you guys an accurate impression of what we see, but it's probably got a little broader range given the moving parts that we're digesting this year.
Alex Zukin - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. I'll cede the floor.
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure.
Operator: The next question comes from Jonathan Ho with William Blair & Company. Please go ahead.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. I just wanted to start out with just maybe going back to the $12 million in investment. I just want to understand sort of why the decision now to increase those investments. And did you guys see sort of a number of opportunities or key product gaps in the portfolio or opportunities to displace competitors? I'm just trying to understand sort of why the decision to make those investments this year.
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. It really isn't just this year. I'd say that $12 million, as I indicated earlier, is incremental to heads we've been adding to, on a discretionary basis, invest in things we thought were important. And probably our run rate now, as I said, it's maybe around $25 million in annual spend that are resources that we can target what we think are important timely investments that will give us a good return. So it's the extension of a process that I think we've been working on for the last few years. I think, in the last few years, M&A activity and the cost of those assets are higher. Cost of our own stock in terms of deploying capital has been higher. And the company executes well on building and investing in existing products, getting them to market and proving their competitive position and being in a very good position to opportunistically take advantage of opportunities that come in front of us. And we think that's a very good investment for Tyler's shareholders. It's a company that knows how to execute. And when you're in that position, you should invest in your own company, and that's what we're doing. In terms of where it'll go, integration is a big thing. The unique thing about Tyler is we're the only company, as we say over and over, that really has all the major enterprise applications that are essential to local government. And as those products become further integrated, they add value to each other, and that's something that our competition really can't do. So we have good competitors in each of those sub-verticals, but the people we compete with in courts don't have financial systems. And the people we compete within financial systems generally don't have tax systems or public safety systems. So one of the major themes, and we mentioned the corporate R&D team, is to better integrate these different products that on their own are all very competitive. But as they become more seamlessly integrated and actually add value to each other's application, really creates something for Tyler that's going to be hard to match by the rest of the market. So that'd be an example of something we're integrating. Technology drives the need for new functionality. Mobility right now, obviously, a very big deal. User experiences get tired and have to be refreshed. That's a big investment for us. That's a big determining factor in the sales process. And then, extending functionality. So some of our applications really have come along with our core and strong applications that maybe on their own are not industry leading. So enterprise asset management, for example, would be an area where we had an application, probably wasn't industry leading, that with added expertise and subject matter experts and head count, and the objective is to make that by itself industry leading as we go forward. So it's across the applications in our view, it'll continually drive a stronger competitive position and it will position us to be very competitive when new opportunities come on line. And an example would be E-File. We didn't just kind of go bid and win the Texas E-File deal, that kind of catapulted us as a leader in that space across the country. We have done an acquisition. We had consciously invested in that product and brought it up to be industry leading, and we were in a great position to take advantage of an opportunity when it came out. And we're, right now, consciously doing that across our product suites.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. And then just relative to your comment about maybe some New World customers or potential customers slowing down their evaluation process, in your experience when you've made acquisitions of other companies, how long has it taken for the customers to get comfortable? And is this a situation where they start to evaluate other competitors or reopen bids? Or is this more of a get-to-know-you type of a scenario?
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't think they usually go backward in the process. It's always hard to know, whether it be a loss that might not have been. I'd say if that has happened, it's been three or four, and again you'll never know for certain, but it's not 12 or 15, it's a few. And some deals, again, were delayed and have been awarded subsequently. So I do not think it'll be a long-term impactful effect, certainly not on public safety because the answer, when they say, hey, what does this mean to us and we tell them what our objective is, we talk about these investments we're making, makes this an even better investment for them. And I really think that's an easy story to tell and that most people in the marketplace would see that as an improvement. So I think it really is, hey, we need someone to come out, we need them to explain what's going on, we need to get comfortable with that, we might need to talk to some Tyler folks or customers. And again, I think on the public safety side that it's going to improve our win rates and I think it'll be a non-issue certainly by mid-year this year. Their ERP side, it's a little harder because obviously Tyler has very strong products already in that space, so people can be concerned. But we can point to our Infinite Visions solutions which have done very well for three years or four years now since we bought those companies and having an Incode and a Munis. So already have multiple suites of financial systems that all have important addressable market spaces that are not much overlapping at all, and there's certainly room for New World in that. And we're carefully targeting those markets and identifying them. And I think as we've demonstrated that we continue to invest, there's been no head count reduction, that people will see that and get more comfortable with it.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Brian Kinstlinger with Maxim Group. Please go ahead.
Brian David Kinstlinger - Maxim Group LLC: Great. Thanks. Wondering if you guys can talk about the pipeline of large Odyssey and E-File contracts. Sounded like there's a number of RFPs in the U.S. and Australia. And maybe expected timelines of awards as you see it.
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, a little bit. It's hard to know exactly, but there are a few deals, statewide kind of deals that we're engaged in that we feel good about in some large counties. Obviously, we've got the 26 or 27 counties (41:47) them in California, which we have virtually no E-File revenue a little bit right now, and that would be the biggest market. And some of those had E-File as part of their initial engagement, some of them contracted subsequently, a few are mandatory. But certainly in the next few years, as those sites go on line, that's a major growth opportunity. So there's still a lot of runway left for E-File.
Brian David Kinstlinger - Maxim Group LLC: And then in terms of bookings, clearly this was a difficult year for comps compared to last year, given California. What's your reasonable goal for bookings growth going forward, is it 10%, is it 15%? I know you've done even more than that in the pastsize. Maybe give us a sense of what's reasonable.
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, it's an important number, I appreciate. But it by itself is hard to say that, Brian, because like we mentioned, a 10-year deal with Raleigh is $8.5 million, and it might have been a $2 million deal if it was on-premise. So the mix of SaaS versus traditional, the length of the terms, it's 10 years or 4 years, so I'd be careful to focus on that exclusively. It really has to be looked at within a number of different things. So if you do normalize that for the Californias or if you had a spike in SaaS versus traditional, then I do think it would be at least 10% and probably should grow a little north of our overall revenue growth rate because the SaaS contracts add more backlog than they will revenue.
Brian David Kinstlinger - Maxim Group LLC: Great. Thanks, John.
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure.
Operator: The next question comes from Scott Berg with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.
Scott Berg - Needham & Co. LLC: Hi, John and Brian. Thanks for taking my questions. We've got a couple of quick ones here. John, first off all, can you just clarify your comments at the beginning with regards to the delayed decisions? The way you made it sound like, there was some maybe Tyler-focused decisions that were also delayed, but your other comments would not suggest that. I just wanted you to clarify that really quick.
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. You're right. Sorry if we gave that impression, but I don't know of any Tyler decisions that were materially affected. It certainly could have been a call or something, but nothing material on Tyler decisions affected by the New World acquisition.
Scott Berg - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. Great, thanks. Brian, I wanted to see if you could talk about the New World financials just a little bit relative to the 8-K that was disclosed, their gross margins look abnormally high relative to other software companies, I'm sure, most of us cover. Is there going to be any changes to how they recognize expenses or revenue? I know there are some obviously moving parts on the revenue side that we've already been made aware of, but more thinking on the expense side as we model out 2016.
Brian K. Miller - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer: Well, when you look at the historic New World financials that were filed with the 8-K, there are a number of differences throughout those from both Tyler's accounting, their – so, as you mentioned, revenue recognition, policies of their books in accordance with GAAP, there should be – would have been, in some cases, somewhat more accelerated than they are under Tyler policies. There's obviously the purchase accounting adjustments that affect the deferred revenue recognition. They were a Sub S corporation, so they didn't have corporate taxes included there. The way they classified R&D in their historic statements would have been different from ours where we have a significant amount of our development expense up in cost of sales, and then a portion of it on the R&D line. Theirs would have been more on the R&D line. So that would have elevated their gross margin versus ours. So there's quite a number of changes through there. But at a very high level, their gross margins and operating margins were higher than ours and should contribute to increasing our blended margins, and part of that is just the nature of the business. They were a relatively simple business, had not done any acquisitions or been acquired. So they really have two core products, the ERP product and the Public Safety product, both of which have been developed organically, more than 50% maintenance revenues, which generates very high margins when you've got that level of scale in maintenance revenues from a couple of relatively mature products. So clearly, it's hard to infer a lot from those pro forma statements, but that's kind of a high-level look at it.
Scott Berg - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. John, it hasn't come up really at all in any of the other questions, but could you talk about the Dynamics royalties just a little bit? Looks like it was the weakest quarter in at least two years, and I wanted to see if it's your understanding that those opportunities are maybe less than or greater than kind of your understanding on how that business has been trending the last couple of years?
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. It was a weak quarter. We've said we don't – we literally open the file and they send it to us, and we really don't – we don't know what we're going to get. So we don't have a lot of visibility on it. I will say, we have gotten the files of the current quarter and it rebounded somewhat. We'll obviously announce that with the next quarter, so it's lumpy. And again, it rebounded to pretty much what was in our plan. So it's going to bounce around. They're not as robust as we'd like them to be, but we really don't have a lot of visibility.
Scott Berg - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. Last question for me. Brian, you've talked the last couple of years about watching your operating margins up to that kind of 30% range. Obviously, you're making an investment this year. But is there any change to maybe how we think about those margin structures as we get to maybe 2018 or 2019?
Brian K. Miller - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer: No, I don't think so. I think our long-term model is still consistent that as we grow revenues in that low to mid-teens, and as we've talked about kind of 12% to 14% has been where our long-term average has been, that over the long term we expect that that, obviously lots of puts and takes with the mix of revenues between SaaS and license, with the acquisition, with investments in products. But over the long term, we expect that that kind of growth will yield north of 100 basis points on average. And it doesn't happen in a straight line every year, but on average in gross margin improvement and better than that on the operating margin and EBITDA margin lines. And even with these investments this year, I think our EBITDA margin, because the New World business overall gives us a lift in that, we'll still see I think relatively stable EBITDA margins, and we'll see gross margin improvement, so.
Scott Berg - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. That's all I have. Thanks for taking my questions.
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure.
Operator: The next question comes from Charlie Strauzer with CJS Securities. Please go ahead.
Robert Majek - CJS Securities, Inc.: Good morning. This is actually Robert Majek in for Charlie.
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning.
Robert Majek - CJS Securities, Inc.: Given the pullback in your recent acquisition of New World, what is your appetite for share buybacks currently?
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Brian, did you announce that number?
Brian K. Miller - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer: Yeah. We did announce. We have 1.4 million shares left in our authorization. We have bought, given the broader pullback in the market in the last few weeks, we bought a modest amount of stocks. I don't think we announced the number till year-end, but we bought a modest amount. And then – but as we said, we've got about 1.4 million shares left in our authorization, and John can comment on our appetite for that going forward.
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So we have been active in the last two weeks since the tech sold off a little bit, obviously recovered a little bit in the last few days, and now we're back down to a level below where we have been active. So, I guess from there, you could infer that we would intend to be active at this level. I don't think we would be trying to do something that's too significant at this level. It's still not a discounted stock, but it certainly got down to an area we will take a long term view. All of our long-term objectives we think are strongly in place, and we think buying at this level and looking out at a couple of years, as to what that means, makes a lot of sense for us. So, at the current level, we would not be overly aggressive but we will be active.
Robert Majek - CJS Securities, Inc.: All of my other questions have been answered. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Kevin Liu with B. Riley & Co. Please go ahead.
Kevin Liu - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Just in terms of the bookings metrics this quarter, it did seem like more of a shift towards SaaS business. I'm just wondering what you're seeing in the pipeline in terms of any potential shift away from on-premise to license? And then, also curious whether some of the larger opportunities you signed on started off as SaaS deals or whether clients ultimately shifted over the course of the quarter?
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It just hasn't changed that significantly in a number of years now. So, high 20s, low 30s in terms of percentage of new names tend to be where it settles out. In any individual quarter, it can bump around, but it really isn't changing. And now we hear so much about the cloud, we offer both. We don't try to have a bias in directing them one direction or another. We believe the name has great value to us in the long-term and we welcome them either way. But the numbers don't change too much. I think, sometimes you see a higher percentage of bookings look like SaaS. SaaS names are growing and sometimes that can be distorted as I indicated earlier, the Raleigh deal, for example. It's a 10-year deal. It's one name, but it's a 10-year deal so it distorts a little bit how many dollars are going into backlog as SaaS dollars versus traditional dollars. But really not a material shift in the number of years at this point.
Kevin Liu - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Got it. And just in terms of e-filing growth, obviously another strong year in 2015. As you look forward now between the states you have contracted and that could potentially come on line versus the overall backlog of business there, what sort of growth do you expect for e-filing this year?
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: This year is a little bit lighter because we literally are bringing a lot of clients, a lot of Odyssey clients online and implementing them, and the E-File revenues will follow after that. So I think there'll be a little of a pause this year. It will be a little lighter growth. But if you just look – we're not talking about names. We're not working. We're just talking about California names, some of the other large counties and states we're working with where we know it's their clear intention to introduce E-File and eventually go mandatory. I think you'll see that growth rate bounce back two, three and four years out.
Kevin Liu - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.
Brian K. Miller - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer: It grew about $9 million in 2015, and I expect it'll be – the growth will be more in the $5 million, $6 million range in 2016. And then as some of the California stuff comes online, we'd probably see that accelerate in 2017.
Kevin Liu - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: The next question comes from Tim Klasell with Northland Securities. Please go ahead.
Tim E. Klasell - Northland Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Two quick questions here. First on the product side, the E9-1-1 initiatives are getting a lot more press here recently, and wondering what sort of synergies are you seeing with initiatives, particularly as it relates to New World? Are those two product sets helping each other out? So maybe a little bit of color there would be appreciated.
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: What two products?
Tim E. Klasell - Northland Securities, Inc.: New World with Public Safety and with your E9-1-1 initiatives around video and in terms of the new Next Generation 9-1-1.
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Our focus will be – we have some Tyler products in that area, they'll be maintained, they'll be invested in. But clearly, in terms of investing in Next-Gen E9-1-1 Solutions to handle texting and a lot of the things that traditionally haven't been handled, multimedia coming through there, that will be – that is part of the significant increase in R&D in the New World side of our business.
Tim E. Klasell - Northland Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then finally, on your tax rate, obviously, that's up a little higher than what we have been modeling. Is that something permanent or is it something that maybe you can work down over the years relative to what the expectations you laid out for 2016?
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Generally, the tax rate is in a pretty tight range. It certainly moves around for a number of different reasons. The outside-the-box increase, which is a little higher, 55%. Obviously, I hope is way higher is associated almost exclusively with the exceptionally high activity of options we had in fourth quarter with a very high stock price, understandable. Our average hold for our employees is over seven years, so there's a lot of options out there and that's a good thing. And there was a lot of activity understandably, and that causes the elimination of deductions that we get and that's what drove the rate higher. And being in the fourth quarter, it's completely absorbed in that quarter. And so, it really is a one-off experience.
Tim E. Klasell - Northland Securities, Inc.: Okay. But even 2016 guidance is a little bit higher than we modeled and I'm sure New World had probably some impact there. Is that sort of the steady state run rate that we should be expecting? You guided 38%, 39.5%. Is that the sort of the range we should be thinking about for the next few years?
Brian K. Miller - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer: Yeah. I think that 38%, 39% is generally the range we widened – where we've historically been, and we put a little bit wider on the high end because of the uncertainty around the level of option exercises. But our rate is pretty close to statutory rates. We don't have significant international operations so everything is pretty much fully taxed at full domestic rates as well as state taxes. So that 38%, 39% range is probably pretty good. Obviously, we'll work on tax planning, look for places where we can get marginal improvements. But absent more overseas business and jurisdictions with lower tax rates, we likely are going to be close to that range.
Tim E. Klasell - Northland Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from John Rizzuto with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.
Anubhav Mehla - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi. This is Anubhav Mehla, sitting in for John. Just two questions. So, the first one on – when you look out to 2016, given your guidance, and what do you see as far as the revenue mix between, let's say, license, services, and maintenance versus, let's say, subscription? I guess, that's the first question. And, I guess, implicit in that is like is there a change in the pace of license revenue growth as we move to the cloud? Thanks.
Brian K. Miller - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer: In a broad range, I think the addition of New World probably shifts a little bit more into the licenses side because New World didn't really or hasn't historically had much of a subscription offering. So, they're almost exclusively licenses. So, I think that the mix is a little bit more on licenses next year, a little bit lower on services. But really, it may be only a point of the mix, something like that. They also had a higher proportion of maintenance, so that probably raises it a point. But I think generally, our mix this year will be similar. 2015, it was about 10% licenses. That might be more like 11% in 2016. We're about a little less than 24% services. I think that might go down a point or two in the mix. Subscriptions were about 19%. That also might go down about a point, but stay pretty similar. Maintenance might go up a point or two. It's around 41.5% in 2015. It might go up, again, a point. And then, appraisal is a relatively slow-growing business, so it probably will modestly continue to be a little bit smaller piece of the mix. But no dramatic changes in the mix.
Anubhav Mehla - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And, I guess, with R&D spending, it's rising, but overall, you pointed out, like, you still expect the gross margins, operating margins to rise. So just – could you just talk about where do you really see the leverage? There's some impact from New World, but New World – where do you really see that leverage in New World, and other than New World maybe in the core business?
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, Tyler – like New World is a good example. So their margins were higher, and they'll be affected a little bit as we go through this transition. But they'll settle out at a much higher level than what Tyler's blended margins are. They're a good example and they're very similar to a lot of our more mature business units. So, I think the reason they're hired, they're not making a lot of investments outside of their core products. They maintained and invested in those well, but they really didn't have a lot of new initiatives around them. When you look at Tyler, our core divisions that have reached a level of scale, Munis or Incode or Infinite Visions, or TMJ (1:01:32) getting to that point, their margins are very similar to New World's, which I think are the appropriate margins for a more mature business units that's reached a certain level of scale where employees are well served, customers are well served, investments are being made in maintaining and expanding products and improving their competitive position. At Tyler, we're consciously choosing to always be investing in new products and new initiatives that bring that core rate down. And so, over time, as those investments in relation to the more mature business units are smaller, the dollars won't be smaller. But as the percentages are smaller, we'll see our blended rates move toward where they are for those mature units that exist, which really is in the 55% to 60% gross margin level and in the 35% operating margin level. So we know that that's sustainable. We choose to be making these investments as we go, which brings the blended rate down, but we believe it's a good investment for the company.
Anubhav Mehla - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Perfectly clear. Thank you.
Brian K. Miller - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer: And just to be clear, the guidance for 2016 implies really a modest increase in gross margin, modest increase in the EBITDA margin, a little bit bigger increase in EBITDA margin, but a decline in operating profit margin because of the elevated R&D that falls below gross margin but is in the operating margin.
Operator: The next question comes from Peter Lowry with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
Peter C. Lowry - JMP Securities LLC: Thanks. Hey, Brian, one quick question. Given the noise around the high level of stock option exercise in New World Systems, is there anything you can say in terms of guidance in terms of how we should think about cash flows in 2016? Anything you would highlight?
Brian K. Miller - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer: Well, cash flows, I mentioned a couple of things that kind of brought down cash flow in 2015 a bit below our normal cash flow margin: the cost associated with the New World acquisition, the timing of some of the taxes where we pay taxes earlier in the year, and then this excess tax benefit from the option exercise really was created at the end of the year. And so that will benefit our next year taxes, and New World billings, the timing of their maintenance billings is favorable for us for 2016 cash flow. But, I think we should, as I said, see some EBITDA expansion and cash flow should sort of grow normally in line with that. So nothing terribly unusual. But, I think some of the things that maybe helped cash flow down a bit in 2015 will turn around and maybe press a little bit above the curve in 2016.
Peter C. Lowry - JMP Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: At this time, there appear to be no more questions. Mr. Marr, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thank you. And we appreciate everybody joining us on the call today. If there are any further questions then feel free to reach out to Brian and myself. Have a great day.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Hello, and welcome to today's Tyler Technologies Third Quarter 2015 Conference Call. Your host for today's call is John Marr, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, October 22, 2015. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Marr. Please go ahead, sir
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Chad, and welcome to our third quarter 2015 earnings call. With me on the call today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like for Brian to give the Safe Harbor statement. Next, I'll have some preliminary comments and Brian will review the details of our third quarter operating results and give 2015 guidance. Then I'll have some final comments and we'll take your questions. Brian?
Brian K. Miller - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: Thanks, John. During the course of this conference call management may make statements that provide information other than historical information, and may include projections concerning the company's future prospects, revenues, expenses, and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless we specify otherwise. John?
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Our third quarter financial performance was very solid with double-digit growth in all revenue lines. From a historical perspective, this was our eighth straight quarter of revenue growth greater than 15%, and in six of the last seven quarters revenue growth has exceeded 17%. Software license and royalty revenues were up nearly 19% and at $15.7 million were the highest in company history. Continued strong growth in our e-filing revenues from courts as well as a gradual shift toward cloud-based software-as-a-service business led to 28% growth in our recurring revenues from subscriptions. We had a very solid quarter for bookings, which rose almost 26%. On a trailing 12-month basis, bookings grew 6% in a difficult comparison because Q2 of last year included bookings of approximately $64 million related to contract signings with California courts. Excluding the California courts contracts, the trailing 12-month bookings rose 18%. Two of our largest new contracts signed during the third quarter included our iasWorld appraisal and tax administration solutions. The largest was a $30 million agreement with Cook County, Illinois. The integrated solution will replace 40-year-old technology used by the county's offices of the assessor, clerk, treasurer, board of review, and the Department of Geographic Information Systems. The county selected multiple Tyler software solutions to meet its property tax administration needs, including CAMA, Tax, Field Mobile for collection and reviewing information in the field, Public Access for online access to property and tax data, and Tyler Content Manager. Cook County has more than 800 local government parcels and a population of 5.3 million. The county, with 128 municipalities, is the second-most populous county in the United States and includes Chicago, the third-most populous city in the United States. We also signed a multi-suite five-year SaaS contract with Lake County, Illinois, for our iasWorld appraisal and tax administration solution and our EnerGov planning, regulatory, and maintenance platform valued at approximately $8.5 million. We signed two significant agreements for our EnerGov solution during the quarter. The first was with Los Angeles County's Department of Public Works in California valued at approximately $9 million. This was a follow-on agreement to our initial EnerGov contract with the Los Angeles County's Department of Regional Planning in 2014. The second contract was with Boulder, Colorado. It is valued at approximately $1.6 million and is a follow-on agreement to our initial contract in the fourth quarter of 2014. We signed several notable contracts in Texas for our Munis ERP solution, including on-premise contracts with Hays County Consolidated Independent School District and the city of League City, and a SaaS contract with Coppell Independent School District. We also signed new SaaS agreements for Munis, each worth more than $1 million, with Madison County, Tennessee, Williamsburg-James County Public Schools and Wise County, all in Virginia, and the city of Benicia, California, and the Allegheny County School District in Maryland. For Courts & Justice, significant contracts in the quarter for our Odyssey solution included an on-premise agreement with Potter County and a SaaS agreement with Karnes County, both in Texas. Also, three California counties, Santa Cruz, Alameda and San Diego, all signed e-filing contracts as a follow-on to their 2014 court case management agreements. Finally, we signed a significant agreement for our Eagle Recorder solution with Santa Clara County, California. As you know, on September 30 we signed a definitive agreement to acquire privately-held New World Systems Corporation for $670 million in cash and stock. New World Systems, a leading provider of public safety and financial solutions for local government, will bring an important element to our portfolio of solutions. Founded in 1981, the Troy, Michigan based company has over 2,000 public sector customers and more than 470 employees. New World Systems is highly complementary to Tyler, and the combination supports our strategy of being an industry leader in all major enterprise applications essential to local government. New World Systems' principal products are: Aegis, a comprehensive public safety suite for dispatch centers, police officers, fire fighters, paramedics, correction officers, command staff and all first responders; and Logos, a suite of public administration software that meets the accounting needs of city and county governments. Public safety represents approximately 67% of New World Systems' revenues. Under the terms of the agreement, we will acquire all of the equity of New World Systems for $360 million in cash and approximately 2.1 million shares of our common stock. The cash portion of the purchase price will be funded from cash on hand and proceeds from a new revolving credit facility. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2015 and is subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. This transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to Tyler. Now I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and update our annual guidance for 2015.
Brian K. Miller - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: Thanks, John. Yesterday Tyler Technologies reported its results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015. I'm going to provide some additional data on the quarter's performance and review our guidance for 2015, and then John will have some additional comments on the quarter and our outlook for 2015. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. Our non-GAAP earnings exclude share-based compensation expense, the employer portion of payroll taxes on employee stock transactions, acquisition-related costs, and amortization of acquired intangibles. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. Revenues for the third quarter were $150.8 million, up 17.2% with 15.7% organic growth. Software license and royalty revenues increased 18.6% and at $15.7 million were the highest level in the company's history. This was our eleventh consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in licenses, and in those 11 quarters, all but one have had growth of over 16%. In Q3 we received $1.0 million of royalties on public sector sales of Microsoft Dynamics AX by other Microsoft VARs, up 12.1% from $906,000 a year ago. Subscription revenues increased 27.9%. We added 35 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 18 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $27.2 million in total contract value. In Q3 of last year we added 38 new subscription-based arrangements and had 11 on-premises conversions representing approximately $16.7 million in total contract value. SaaS clients represented approximately 22% of our new software clients in the quarter compared to 34% in the prior-year quarter. SaaS contract value represented 30% of the total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 28% in Q3 of 2014. The value-weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 5.8 years compared to 5.5 years in last year's third quarter. The fastest-growing subscription-based revenue stream continues to be from the e-filing for courts and online payments. These revenues increased 34% to $11 million from $8.2 million last year. Total e-filing revenue of $8.4 million this quarter grew 36.9% over last year with 19% of that increase related to our Texas e-filing contract, which contributed $4.8 million of revenues this quarter. Our blended gross margin for the quarter declined 40 basis points to 47.6%, mainly due to continued onboarding of professional services and development staff to support our current backlog and anticipated new business. Since September 30, 2014, our implementation in development staff has grown by 182 employees. Our non-GAAP gross margin declined by 20 basis points to 48.6%. SG&A expense increased 16.5% and was 21.1% of total revenues, an improvement of 20 basis points from last year's third quarter. Excluding noncash share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related costs, SG&A expense increased only 11.7%. Operating income was $31.5 million, an increase of 17.7%. Non-GAAP operating income was $39.3 million, up 21.5%. Despite slightly lower gross margins, the non-GAAP operating margin improved 100 basis points to 26.1% as we achieved substantial leverage from both SG&A and R&D expenses. Net income rose 18.5% to $20.1 million or $0.55 per diluted share. The fully diluted share count increased by approximately 1.1 million shares, primarily from stock option exercises and, to a lesser extent, stock issued in acquisitions. Our effective tax rate was 36.5% and benefited from a higher qualified manufacturing activities deduction. Our effective tax rate may increase during the fourth quarter as stock option exercises increase and generate significant excess tax benefits that limit this deduction. Free cash flow was $52.7 million, compared to $64.7 million in last year's third quarter. Days sales outstanding and accounts receivable were 77 days at September 30, 2015, compared to 78 days at September 30, 2014. DSOs decreased sequentially from 94 days at June 30, which is our normal seasonal trend related to the timing of maintenance billings. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $757.7 million, a new high, and was up 12.4% from last year's third quarter. Software-related backlog, which excludes backlog from appraisal services contracts, was $707.7 million, an 11.6% increase. Backlog included $171.9 million of maintenance, compared to $152.1 million a year ago. Subscription backlog was $236.9 million, compared to $194.7 million last year. Our bookings for the quarter, which are calculated from the change in backlog plus revenues, were $186 million, up 25.7%. On a trailing 12-month basis, bookings rose 5.5% over last year. We signed 28 new contracts in the third quarter that included software licenses greater than $100,000, and those contracts had an average license of $579,000 compared to 30 new contracts with an average license value of $475,000 in the third quarter of 2014. Our guidance, updated for the full year of 2015 is as follows. We currently expect 2015 revenues will be between $578 million and $583 million. We expect 2015 diluted GAAP EPS will be approximately $2.01 to $2.07. We expect 2015 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be approximately $2.56 to $2.62. For the year, estimated noncash share-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $20.3 million to $20.8 million. Fully diluted shares for the year is expected to be between 36 million and 36.5 million shares. We estimate an effective annual tax rate for 2015 between 36.5% and 37.5%. The tax rate and share count each are affected by the timing and volume of stock option exercises. We expect our total capital expenditures will be approximately $14 million to $15 million for the year. Total depreciation and amortization is expected to be between approximately $15.5 million and $16 million including approximately $7 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Note that this guidance does not include any impact from the proposed acquisition of New World Systems, as the completion and timing of the acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. Now I would like to turn the call back over to John for his further comments.
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Brian. We've reported for some time now that the markets have recovered from the 2008 financial disruptions and been behaving relatively normally. In the past several months we've actually experienced at least a modest acceleration in activity. RFP activity in Q3 was clearly ahead of longer term run rates. It's a short period of time to draw any conclusions from, but directionally we are encouraged. I would characterize our competitive position as steady at a strong level and attribute the higher license revenues to a marginally stronger market. We continue to work toward closing the New World Systems deal in the fourth quarter. Since signing the definitive agreement, we have had more exposure to their team and continue to be impressed. Along with the obviously strong knowledge, industry knowledge and strong competencies in the team, there is genuine excitement regarding the combination. The early reaction from clients and prospects has been that they are excited about the complementary nature of the combination, positioning Tyler to provide the most comprehensive offering in the market which will help government be more productive for their citizens. Now Chad, we'll take questions.
Operator: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Please limit your question to one and one follow-up, and then place yourself back in the queue for additional questions. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble that roster. Our first question comes today from Charlie Strauzer with CJS Securities.
Charles Strauzer - CJS Securities, Inc.: Hey, good morning. John, Brian, John, you talked about the pickup you're seeing in the RFP space, RFP pipeline, I should say, in Q3. Can you give us a little bit more granularity in terms of what areas you're seeing the pickup in? Is it more courts-related, financial, et cetera? And also looking into kind of Q4, is that kind of pace kind of staying where it was in Q3?
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Really, probably the only area – courts is still a smaller market. So any trends there have to be longer term otherwise they're pretty anecdotal. It's really more in the financial side of the business where the volume of activity is large enough that even shorter swings are interesting to us. So I guess I'm talking more about the financial side. It just seemed that there was a lot of RFP activity and a lot of activity that I think is worth noting in the third quarter. Again, there's ebbs and flows here and maybe it goes right back to the normal level but everybody wants to watch the local government marketplace, and there's always some pressure on their budgets. And again, in the short term anyways, what we're seeing for activity in the marketplace suggests that it's going to remain at least steady if not accelerate a little bit. So that's somewhat encouraging to us.
Charles Strauzer - CJS Securities, Inc.: Are you seeing these kind of more larger municipalities or agencies that are putting these RFPs out? Or is it just, kind of just a wider breadth of RFPs that you're seeing?
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's a wider breadth, but as you saw, as I think Brian just mentioned, I mean the average software license fee in our over $100,000 category, went up about $100,000 year-over-year. So there's pretty good activity on the higher end of our range and our addressable market but I do think over a long period of time we've consistently been becoming more and more competitive on, again, the higher end of our range, which is not the ultra-high side of the market where we don't play as actively but really this Tier 2, into the lower end of Tier 1 space. I think Tyler's competitiveness has consistently improved.
Charles Strauzer - CJS Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much.
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Brian Kinstlinger with Maxim Group.
Brian David Kinstlinger - Maxim Group LLC: Great. Thanks so much. I wanted to start with e-file. It's been such a good business for you. So I'm wondering as you look at your e-file installed base, especially the large counties and states, do you expect any are going to mandate e-filing in 2016 and maybe specifically also touch on L.A., where you are with that process, in install?
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Predicting exactly when certain counties or states go mandatory is difficult. Even if they have a clear intention, some of them have legislative processes they need to go through. So not to avoid the question, Brian, but it would be hard to be that specific for you. It is our clear perception that most of these clients, say for example most of the counties in California that are in the midst of their case management implementation, have the expectation that at some point in time as the case management systems are in place that they will move toward, they'll implement e-filing and that they will ultimately make it mandatory. So I think the general atmosphere out there that when people have good back-end systems in place, that they intend to move forward with e-filing and ultimately appreciate that for them to get high adoption and to become a paperless courthouse, they need to implement mandatory and we're seeing a clear trend toward that. So I can't give you quarter-by-quarter which jurisdictions will do that, but it's the clear impression we have that the vast majority of our clients are moving in that direction.
Brian David Kinstlinger - Maxim Group LLC: Right. And my follow-up, with more RFP activity that you've discussed, especially you mentioned the higher end picking up, how does Dynamics fit in your proposal plan? Should we see more direct sales from Dynamics in your view and maybe gaining more traction? Or will you be continuing to propose Munis, even at the high end level much more so than Dynamics?
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, certainly our direct channel, and our direct presence in the marketplace is considerably larger with Munis and considerably more established, and they're doing well in that space. So we're certainly not going to back off that. We have identified a number of sub segments or certain areas in the marketplace where we believe Dynamics is competitive and can build momentum and grow our presence in the marketplace. And so we're focused on that with some direct resources. I think the growth in our sales channel around Dynamics is supporting their partners, both domestically and internationally, and at different levels of government, federal government, not-for-profits, higher ed, et cetera, agencies. And so there's a pretty comprehensive plan that we'll work together with Microsoft on. And I think Tyler's, you could look at it, for the past, last five years or six years, our experience in government has been applied to the R&D side, and we're transitioning to where we'll have less of a role in the R&D side. We'll have reduction in head count there, and we'll bring our market expertise to the go-to-market side and try to enable their partners to attack all those sub-markets and extended markets that we don't have a strong presence in at this time.
Brian David Kinstlinger - Maxim Group LLC: Great. Thank you so much.
Operator: The next question comes from Alex Zukin with Stephens.
Alex J. Zukin - Stephens, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Congratulations on another great quarter. Seems like from a SaaS perspective, you saw a lot more dollar conversions this quarter than even kind of from the new business. And I guess I'm just curious, is there any trend that we can take away from that? Anything that's changing? Are we reaching a new inflection point? And then, why the disparity in terms of the conversions versus the net new?
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It goes up and down quarter to quarter, so you need to look at a number of quarters. Q2 really wasn't very good for newer conversions. Q3 was better, and Q4's outlook is pretty good. So it bumps around a little bit. I think the way we've described it is the local government marketplace is slower to make changes, that we're seeing a gradual shift in that direction. I think that's still accurate language for this, but we see traction in our installed base and in the new business market. We're adding, what, I think, around 55 names, a little more than half of those new names, a little less than half conversions, and we're satisfied and happy with that. And it just gradually gains a little bit of momentum.
Brian K. Miller - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: And, Alex, it really was weighted more towards, the numbers we gave in the remarks earlier, the dollar value of the SaaS deals. That $16.7 million in contract value was a combination of both the new and the conversions last year, and the $27.2 million is a combination of the two. So it still is more heavily weighted towards the new customers. And we did have a couple of very large new SaaS customers this quarter. So I don't think there was a big change in the dollar value of the conversions.
Alex J. Zukin - Stephens, Inc.: Got it. That's helpful. And can you guys talk about, I mean the Cook County deal. How many of those types of deals are out there in any given year? And how does that kind of factor into how many of those do you think you guys do in any given year?
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, not many. Historically, kind of mega deals like that have been courts. And they're out there. I think our win rates are very good. In the courtside, Washington, Oregon, Maryland. Those were all big statewide deals in the last few years, kind of in this size range. And occasionally, they come around in tax and appraisal. Cook, but it's a top three county, as we said. Our competitive position in those situations is very, very good. I think our win rates would be real high. There aren't a lot of companies that have our size and our resources and history and experience in that space. So I think we compete very, very well when they come out. But they're obviously going to be more infrequent. So as a company, two, three kind of outsize deals is what we do in the course of the year normally.
Alex J. Zukin - Stephens, Inc.: Perfect. And then on New World, what's been the reception, I guess, from prospective customers around the acquisition? In the sense that as you've continued to meaningfully increase your breadth of offerings, is it starting to, is it changing the conversation with prospective customers in any way in terms of size of initial wallet?
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. It's been very positive, the initial reception. As we know, there's a little overlap, between some of our products and some of their financial applications, but it really isn't that significant in the overall deal. The excitement is around the complementary nature of the deal. So for our clients to have an industry-leading public safety system available to them that we clearly intend to integrate more seamlessly over time and add value to their existing solutions for their public book safety clients. We've heard from clients that said, hey, we were looking for one or the other and now we know we can get one that will be integrated and add value and make us more efficient. There's been a lot of that positive response and even on the financial side, they have certain applications that are strong that we don't have. We have, certainly a lot of applications that they don't have that are on top of the core financials that will become available to these clients. So the options that both client bases will have for complementary products has been what they're focused on and it's been pretty enthusiastic.
Alex J. Zukin - Stephens, Inc.: Got it. And maybe just one last one from me. With respect to any trends, how insulated are you guys with respect to some of the macro events in the economy, from state budgets that may be exposed to issues around commodities? Can you just walk us through the dynamics of why that maybe not, doesn't matter as much for you guys?
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I mean, over a long period of time – unfortunately I have that perspective now of 30 years or more – it is very rare that, let's say, normal economic cycles impact our market. And some of that's, we're just fortunate, and some of it's by design. So really in the last 30 years in my view, our market has been impacted twice. One was a technical issue with Y2K, and the second was the 2008 financial crisis or disruption, whatever we want to call it. In 2008, it was extreme enough that state revenue sharing and federal revenue sharing going to local governments, at least got threatened, and in some cases, got impacted. So some of these projects were put on hold. And in recent years, those projects have been executed because they're essential, and the market has been pretty good. So your typical ebbs and flows generally don't affect us for two reasons. First, local government generally funds these types of really general fund types of investments through their own direct revenues, which are property taxes, utility revenues, the direct revenues to local government that don't get impacted, right? I mean, all of us pay less when we have a year where we earn less. But we pay the same property tax bill that we have on the house we own, and we pay the same water bill. So those revenues are much more stable than state and federal revenues where sales tax and income tax can be more volatile. And the second reason is that everything we do, and this is the part that would be by design, everything is an enterprise solution. It's important to them. And it's essential. They have to do it whether it's printing tax bills or running payrolls or managing the courts. And so this is not discretionary. It has to happen when budgets are flush and when budgets are tight. So generally, we're impacted very little with the couple of exceptions that I noted.
Alex J. Zukin - Stephens, Inc.: That's very helpful. Thank you, guys.
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.
Stewart Kirk Materne - Evercore ISI: Thanks very much. Good morning, guys. I guess, John, my first question would be, as you guys have grown and you're adding New World to the mix here, I was just kind of curious of on your view of the ability for you all to start having a bit more of a broader channel of partners, especially services partners. The bigger GSIs have generally not focused on state and local or at least local governments, and they sort of, it's more federal and state level. But you guys are clearly showing that there's a lot of business to be done with sort of more local municipalities and a lot of things you guys are doing like e-filing or pretty transformational type of projects. So I'm just kind of curious if over the next year or two, maybe not in the immediate near term, but as you put New World together, is there an opportunity to maybe start to get some greater distribution and maybe services leverage out of more services partners or integrators?
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, it's a good question and it really points to a conscious decision on our part that differentiates us from many of the other players. And what I think what you're saying is you guys are evolving into a more substantial software company, obviously a lot of the software companies you follow use partners to get leverage in their service channels and presence out there in the marketplace. And yes, we're a big enough company now that I think we could attract legitimate IT service integrators to implement our systems. It's a pretty conscious decision on our part to have not gone in that direction. So this is something when we're selling our systems that we focus on a lot, and that is that when we go out and bid a deal, we own that deal. So it's not just our software, it's the conversions. It's the project management. It's the implementers. It's product extensions that may need to be done. And the success rate in our view is considerably higher than when you have an integrator and a software company and multiple contracts or elements of contracts and some areas that aren't as clear as to who actually owns that responsibility. And then post-implementation, whatever was done in the implementation, whether they're product extensions or the way the product was implemented is much more completely transitioned to post-implementation support relationship. So if you were to be hearing what we're telling our marketplace is that having the IT service side and having a complete kind of one throat to choke kind of an approach differentiates us. We announce these new deals focused on California courts and to the market, they can add up the contracts and see where we're going directionally. There's an incredible execution part of that business. And as important to having won the business in the first place it is successfully executing on those projects, which we have a very good record on. And obviously one feeds the other. The success in the market leads to new business. So you make a very good observation, Kirk. We'd have higher margins if we didn't have as big a professional service side of our business. The business matrix may look a little better. But in our view, it's a strategic part of our offering that differentiates us, especially from Tier 1 software providers.
Stewart Kirk Materne - Evercore ISI: Yeah. That makes sense. And maybe just stripping out sort of the margin dynamics of it. I guess my question is more about just geographic reach and influence. Meaning, let's just take e-filing for example. If you had a bigger, say global or national partner, I guess, national in your case, partner working with you, do you think there's a way to get to more opportunities faster or do you think this is just a market where it is a slow and steady sort of wins the race kind of situation? So having a bigger more national brand from an integration perspective, helping you sort of get in front of more decision-makers potentially faster isn't something that's necessarily required when you're thinking about these kind of more sort of transformational deals?
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think our bias in our current end market is to continue to do most of that directly. It's not like we have a bright line where we wouldn't partner with somebody who had relationships or presence in certain markets. But generally our bias – and I feel, certainly in courts because that's a pretty well defined and somewhat limited market. I think we're trying to manage our sales channel and our service channels to be able to address all the markets that's out there. I mean I think we really know the states and major counties that are coming out in the coming, really, three years, four years, five years and feel we have the capacity to address that. You mentioned international, I think that for a lot of reasons could be a place that we might partner more. Obviously, culturally and presence and relationships and a lot of things that we could leverage. So as we go that direction over a long period of time, probably a little more of it there.
Stewart Kirk Materne - Evercore ISI: Okay. I'll leave it to others. Thanks very much, John.
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Berg with Needham & Company.
Scott Berg - Needham & Co. LLC: Hey, John and Brian. Congrats on another nice quarter.
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks.
Scott Berg - Needham & Co. LLC: Two questions from me. First of all John, your tax and appraisal software business was a laggard in the business a couple of years ago. Obviously we've seen a lot of larger deals last couple of years, whether it's New York City or the $30 million deal you announced in the quarter there. But how do you view that business kind of on a go forward basis, maybe over the next one to two years? Can you see some of the similar types of demand trends like you see in maybe – in general in Courts & Justice may appear, or is that maybe just a short term impact to the company that you've seen recently?
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, it's a good observation. There's no question that, I think it was 2006 that they kind of got off the track a little bit, and we had to rein that division in and there was even some pressure to get out of that business because it didn't have as much growth and the appraisal service side wasn't completely consistent with what we did. And so we have looked at it for that period of time, the last seven years, eight years, nine years as a sticky part of our business. As I said earlier, it's tax revenue. It's important, and to have a presence in that office is important even if it's not as robust a business for us. So we always looked at that as a lower grower. And margins getting diluted somewhat by the appraisal service side of things. It hasn't been the case, obviously this year or maybe the last 18 months. And it's a good question. Is that a blip? And at least for let's say the next 18 months, it'll continue. There'll be higher growth than there has been historically. Probably should grow at least at or maybe above Tyler's average growth across the company. And certainly on the software side of the business, which used to be half of the business and now it's I think about 70% of the business. Margins will continue to benefit from scale and expand. So that business is definitely outperforming our long range forecast in terms of both growth and margin expansion. And we think for the foreseeable future, say 18 months to 24 months, that will continue. Hard to know beyond that.
Scott Berg - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. And a follow-up for Brian. Brian, you've historically talked, at least over the last couple of years, on the company's desire to get operating margins above 30% and ways you can get there over the next couple of years. Obviously, the New World acquisition will be accretive to your margin profile, and probably helps you get there a little bit more quickly. But how do you view margins maybe two years to four years out, more longer term now, A), with that acquisition, and B), with some of the other leverage success that you're currently having?
Brian K. Miller - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: As we talked about in the New World acquisition announcement call, New World does have margins above our current blended gross margins, but their margins are consistent with a similar business within Tyler that has a lot of scale and has a high degree of recurring revenues from a single product. So they're not really – they will be accretive to our margin profile, but they're not really out of line with where parts of Tyler are. And our long-term goals on margins have been very consistent over a number of years and those still are in place. We believe that if we can grow in the low to mid-teens that we get meaningful margin expansion at the gross margin line of 100 basis points a year or better, that would be an annual average. As you've seen, it doesn't happen necessarily in a straight line. There are years where they're flat or with more pressure on margins, gross margins, as we have this year, and there are years where we have 200 basis points and 300 basis points of margin expansion. But those long-term expansion goals we believe are still consistent with what we've done historically in the past, and that we have a lot of margin, gross margin improvement opportunity, some of that coming from New World. But certainly in Tyler's businesses, as other businesses like our Courts & Justice business continue to gain scale, have new higher margin revenue sources such as e-filings, start to layer in there, as the recurring revenues, which are higher margin, continue to build to become a bigger piece of the product or the revenue mix, and as we continue to move beyond kind of the investment stage in some of our newer products, like our EnerGov product and those margins start to be enhanced. All of those things are contributing factors to this long term 100-plus basis point annual margin expansion, assuming growth consistent with what our historical growth has been. And as we've said, we believe that we can get substantial leverage from both SG&A and R&D, the two things below the gross margin line, that translate in to higher operating margin expansion. And we've seen that, for example, this quarter, where we actually had a little bit of a pullback in the gross margin, but we still got 100 basis points of operating margin expansion because SG&A and R&D are both growing at a much lower rate than our revenue growth is. So we believe that those trends remain in place. Again. they're not necessarily on a straight line. So there's sometimes we're above that profile and sometimes we're below it. But that's how we expect to continue to drive margin expansion in the long term and move from this mid 25%, 26% operating margin non-GAAP that we currently have to 30% and north of that. And as we said, there are parts of our business where we're above that, even above that target currently. And we have a plan to move other parts of our business more in line with that.
Scott Berg - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. That's all I have at the moment. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: The next question comes from Jonathan Ho with William Blair & Company.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Let me echo my congratulations as well. Just wanted to start out, can you just give us a sense of how much is left in backlog from the Texas e-file? And when we could maybe anticipate another extension of that?
Brian K. Miller - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: Sure. That contract was initially a four-year contract, and it currently has just shy of $37 million of remaining backlog as of September 30. And that's currently playing out at about $4.8 million a quarter, and it really stays at that level and takes a little bit of a step up, but very minor step up in 2017. So the contract runs through September of 2017, and $37 million of backlog left. So it's about halfway through right now.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. And then, go ahead.
Brian K. Miller - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: I expect that we certainly have a close relationship with Texas and we had a big event recently where we celebrated the go-live of Texas e-filing in all 254 counties several months ahead of schedule when those last counties went live, so that project is working extremely well. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court held a press conference and celebrated the success of the project, so it's obviously working very well and I expect that before we get too close to the end of the contract we'll have discussions with them about extending it. It does have – the contract provides for a series of one year renewals in the original contract, but we're still a little bit off from approaching the end of that.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. And then just wanted to understand just in terms of, I guess, the staffing level increases that you guys talked about in terms of head count, have you been able to hire enough people? And sort of how comfortable are you with the head count levels relative to the expense side now that you've kind of increased it over the period of this year?
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I mean, we've been in a growth and recruitment mode for a long time. I think our HR side of the business has got recruiters embedded in all of these different divisions, so it's an active machine generally. I mean, sometimes when you see operating profit at a higher level than say the beat on the revenue, so in other words more falling through, a lot of that is sometimes that you almost always trail behind, so the head count growth we have in the fourth quarter probably won't be met, but it's certainly not a problem. Tyler's an employer of choice. In all of our major geographies, we recruit aggressively. We have a strong presence in the marketplace and it's a matter of timing like I said. Sometimes you schedule positions and it's 30 days, 60 days later, but we certainly don't see ourselves as looking at those pools as having run out and it being a long-term problem, but it's just an ongoing part of our business.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. And just one last one if I may. In terms of Microsoft, has there been any sort of update there in terms of maybe wind down of the relationship or reallocation of resources? Just want to get a sense of what's happening there.
Brian K. Miller - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: There really hasn't been anything definitive done since the last call say, but the general direction of the relationship that we've reported is still our expectation which would be considerably lower R&D head count and spend and some increase as I said earlier on the sales side and the service side of things, but overall a net decrease in heads and costs for us. Revenues are not explosive, but they're going in the right direction, so the performance of that business should continue to improve.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes today from Tim Klasell with Northland Securities.
Tim E. Klasell - Northland Securities, Inc.: Good morning everybody and my congrats on the quarter as well. Most of my questions have been answered, but you mentioned the RFP pipeline has been building nicely. As we look on to 2016, could that change the seasonality? Do you guys have any feeling that, gee, there's a certain quarter or two where a lot of these deals may close or a large one? Or is it too difficult to judge at this point?
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's probably too difficult to judge, and it should continue to level out. The recurring revenues, as a percentage of revenues at Tyler are so significant. The bigger deal experience, which is mostly POC accounting, is pretty straight line as well. So the sell, deliver and recognize licenses is becoming a very small percentage of our overall business. And so therefore, I think that's why you're seeing this predictability, these marginal beats. They're really getting into a pretty tight range, and I think that's a function of the maturing of the business overall. High recurring revenues, more large deals coming out of percentage of completion and the impact of licenses within a quarter being less in terms of total influence on the numbers.
Tim E. Klasell - Northland Securities, Inc.: Okay. And just a specific deal related question. At Cook County, obviously their systems were ancient. But was there a specific catalyst that happened where they suddenly said that we really had to modernize their systems?
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't know of a specific catalyst. As we indicated, it's a 40-year old platform and I'd say it's been a number of years in the making for them to – this was a long project for them to create, design, manage the scope and it's been a several year process at the least. So just time to make a change.
Tim E. Klasell - Northland Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. That's helpful.
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay.
Operator: The next question is from Kevin Liu with B. Riley & Company.
Kevin Liu - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Just one question on the subscription business. You talked about the growth there being driven by both e-filing as well as online payments. I wanted to clarify whether the online payments piece is distinct from kind of the e-filing transaction piece you get? And if so, what products those are tied to, the size of that business and how much growth you're seeing there?
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's a little of both. Online payments is really how the e-filing revenue is captured, so I think we mean that more. We do have some online payments business as well, but it would be very insignificant compared to the overall e-filing business.
Brian K. Miller - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: Yeah. For example, this quarter e-filing was about $8.5 million of revenues, online payments separate from that is about $2.5 million. Online payments is primarily where we process either traffic tickets or utility bills, in many cases for smaller clients that don't want to manage their website themselves, but use our software, and we get a convenience fee for that. Because it tends to be more with the smaller clients it's not as nearly as fast growing business as the e-filing. So most of that growth is on the e-filing side.
Kevin Liu - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Got it. And also one quick one on Dynamics. Just the royalties there seem to be on a little bit of an upswing. As you start to transition over to doing more kind of sales and support of the VARs, do you feel like you'll start to get better visibility there? And do you expect kind of the current run rate of revenues to continue?
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. We really don't have any better visibility. I think as their footprint and presence in the market continues to mature, hopefully the consistency and the direction of it is a little bit predictable. But we don't have any specific insight into the activity in their channel.
Kevin Liu - B. Riley & Co. LLC: All right. That's all I had. Thanks so much.
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure.
Operator: The next question is from Peter Lowry with JMP Securities.
Peter C. Lowry - JMP Securities LLC: Great. Thanks. Just one quick big-picture question. Can you recap just what the greatest demand drivers in the state and local governments (51:45) right now? But then looking forward say three years to five years, do you see any change in what the drivers might be?
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Not really. I mean again, it's what we say, it's a steady market. These are all enterprise essential apps. There's a huge inventory of systems out there that are aging and not well supported. And every year a small percentage of those go back out in the marketplace. So it's our kind of hope and expectation that this continues to be a pretty steady market.
Peter C. Lowry - JMP Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: At this time there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Marr, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.
John S. Marr - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thanks, Chad. And thank you to everybody participating on the call today. We appreciate it. And if you have any further questions, feel free to reach out to Brian or myself. Thank you very much, and have a great day.
Operator: Thank you, sir. That concludes today's call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Hello, and welcome to today's Tyler Technologies' Second Quarter 2015 Conference Call. Your host for today's call is John Marr, President and CEO, of Tyler Technologies. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, July 23, 2015. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Marr. Please go ahead.
John S. Marr Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Robert, and welcome to our second quarter 2015 earnings call. With me on the call today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like for Brian to give the Safe Harbor statement. Next, I'll have some preliminary comments. Brian will review the details of the second quarter operating results and 2015 guidance. Then I'll have some final comments and we'll take your questions. Brian?
Brian K. Miller - Executive Vice President - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: Thanks John. During the course of this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information, and may include projections concerning the company's future prospects, revenues, expenses, and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We'd refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless we specify otherwise. John?
John S. Marr Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Our second quarter financial performance was outstanding with revenues and earnings exceeding our internal expectations. From an historical perspective, this was our seventh straight quarter of revenue growth greater than 15%, and in five quarters of the last six quarters revenue growth exceeded 17.5%. Software license and royalty revenues were up 21%, and at $14.6 million were the highest in company history. Our 29% growth in recurring revenues from subscriptions reflects continued strong growth in our e-filing revenues from courts, as well as a continuing gradual shift towards cloud-based Software-as-a-Service businesses. As we previously discussed, we had a very difficult comparison for bookings this quarter. This last year's second quarter included approximately $64 million in new contracts in California for our Odyssey court solutions. On an absolute basis, bookings this quarter declined 25%. Excluding the California courts deals from last year's second quarter, bookings rose 3% for the quarter, and 12% for the trailing 12 months. While there are lot of moving parts in the bookings comparisons, the key takeaway is that our bookings, especially with respect to large contracts, are often very lumpy. Significant new contracts during the second quarter included a five-year SaaS agreement with Denver, Colorado for our iasWorld Appraisal and Tax Solution valued at approximately $7.9 million. Denver has been a long-time client and chose to upgrade to our current iasWorld Solution using the cloud. Other significant agreements this quarter included contracts for our Munis Solution with the Stafford County Public Schools in Virginia and Leander Independent School District in Texas, as well as the City of Pleasanton California. A five-year SaaS agreement for Munis with Carroll County, Georgia and a contract for Infinite Visions with the Mesa Unified School District, Arizona's second largest school district by enrollment. We also signed significant multi-suite contracts including Munis and EnerGov with the cities of Waco, Texas and Surprise, Arizona. New clients for our EnerGov planning, regulatory and maintenance solutions included Maui, Kauai, Hawaii; Miami-Dade County, Florida and the City of Overland Park, Kansas. In courts and justice, we signed a follow-on agreement valued at $5 million with the Kern County, California for our Odyssey Integrated Criminal Justice Solution. The county's ICJ agreement allows it join the Kern County Superior Court's current Odyssey Case Management and Implementation project for criminal case processing. With the additional Odyssey applications, such as jails and probation, Kern Superior Court and county justice agencies will operate on a single platform that will significantly streamline criminal justice processes and allow agencies to more effectively share information with one another. Two other California Odyssey clients, San Bernardino and San Diego counties signed contracts to add additional case types including civil for their implementations. Finally, our bookings for the quarter included a new agreement with the Indiana Supreme Court to provide e-filing for courts statewide. This five-year $20 million contract is a fixed price arrangement similar to our e-filing contract in Texas. Indiana also uses our Odyssey Case Management System in courts statewide. Indiana represents our 11th statewide e-filing arrangement. Several of these are still ramping up and we're confident they will continue to build upon our position as a leader in the emerging space. At the end of May, we acquired Brazos Technology Corporation for $6.1 million in cash, and 12,500 shares of Tyler stock valued at $1.5 million. Brazos is a provider of mobile held solutions used primarily by law enforcement agencies for field accident reporting and electronically issuing citations. And the Brazos product line is a significant addition to our Public Safety suite. Brazos had revenues of approximately $10 million last year. Lastly, in May we hosted approximately 2,800 clients in Atlanta at Tyler Connect, our Annual User Conference. At Connect, we announced a new Tyler-wide continuous improvement initiative called EverGuide which builds on our evergreen approach to software licensing. EverGuide will provide the focus and structure to help public sector clients maximize, protect and get the most of their software investment by ensuring they receive maximum benefits from the enhancements released through our evergreen approach to releases and updates. Now, I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and update our annual guidance for 2015.
Brian K. Miller - Executive Vice President - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015. I am going to provide some additional data on the quarter's performance and review our guidance for 2015. Then John will have some additional comments on the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year. In our earning release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results in comparisons with peers in the software industry. Our non-GAAP earnings exclude share-based compensation expense, the employer portion of payroll taxes on employee stock transactions, and amortization of acquired intangibles. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. Revenues for the second quarter were $146.3 million, up 17.6% with 16.8% organic growth. Software license and royalty revenues increased 20.7% and at $14.6 million were the highest level in the company's history. This was our 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in licenses and in three quarters of the last four quarters license and royalty revenues have grown by more than 20%. In Q2, we received $1.2 million of royalties on public sector sales of Microsoft Dynamics AX, by other Microsoft VARs more than doubled the royalties of $576,000 a year ago. One contract with the U.S. Federal Agency accounted for more than half of the royalties this quarter. Subscriptions revenues increased 28.7%. We added 34 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 20 existing on-premises clients representing approximately $16.9 million in total contract value. In Q2 of last year, we added 44 new subscription-based arrangements and had 21 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $17.8 million in total contract value. SaaS clients represented approximately 24% of our new software clients in the quarter, compared to 28% in the prior year quarter. SaaS contract value represented 30% of the total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 12% in Q2 of 2014. The value-weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was five years compared to 5.6 years in last year's second quarter. The fastest growing subscription-based revenue stream is from e-filing for courts and online payments. These revenues increased 30.7% to $10 million from $7.7 million last year. Total e-filing revenue of $7.6 million this quarter grew 32.7% over last year with 45% of that increase related to our Texas e-filing contract which contributed $4.8 million of revenues this quarter. Our blended gross margin for the quarter declined 40 basis points to 46.7% mainly due to accelerated hiring and on-boarding of professional services and development staff to support our current backlog and anticipated new business. Our non-GAAP gross margin also declined by 40 basis points to 47.5%. We have added a net of 333 people in the last 12 months, with 86% of those included in cost of sales. Our total head count grew by 134 employees in the second quarter to 3,068 employees, including 41 employees added through the Brazos acquisition. SG&A expense increased 10.9% in the quarter and was 20.8% of total revenues, a decrease of 120 basis points from last year's second quarter. Excluding non-cash share-based compensation expense, SG&A expense increased only 8% (10:34), only half the rate at which our revenues grew. Operating income was $29.6 million, an increase of 25.3%. Non-GAAP operating income was $36 million, up 25.3%. Despite slightly lower gross margins, the non-GAAP operating margin improved 150 basis points to 24.6% as we obtained substantial leverage from both SG&A and R&D expenses. Net income rose 27.8% to $18.8 million, or $0.52 per diluted share. Fully diluted share count increased by approximately 936,000 shares primarily from stock option exercises, and to a lesser extent, stock issued in acquisitions. During the second quarter we repurchased approximately 5,400 shares of our common stock for a total of $645,000 or about $119.50 per share. Our effective tax rate was 36.8% and benefited from a higher qualified manufacturing activities deduction. Our effective tax rate may increase during the second half of the year, if stock option exercises increase and generate significant excess tax benefits that limit this deduction. Free cash flow was $12.7 million compared to $9.4 million in last year's second quarter. Note that free cash flow was reduced by cash tax payments of $16.8 million in the second quarter compared to $8.6 million last year. Days sales outstanding and accounts receivables were 94 days at June 30, 2015, compared to 104 days at June 30, 2014. DSOs increased sequentially from 71 days at March 31, which is our normal seasonal trend related to the timing of maintenance billings. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $723 million, up 10.4% from last year's second quarter. Software related backlog, which excludes backlog from appraisal services contracts, was $672.4 million, an 8.6% increase. Backlog included $165 million of maintenance compared to $154.4 million a year ago. Subscription backlog was $229 million compared to $185.7 million last year. Our bookings for the quarter, which are calculated from the change in backlog, plus revenues, were $179 million, down 25.1% from last year's second quarter. Q2 of last year included bookings of approximately $64 million related to the California court signings. Excluding the California courts deals, bookings for this quarter rose 2.8%. For the 12 months ended June 30, bookings declined 10.8% over the prior 12-month period, as the prior 12-month comparison included the California courts deal signed in Q2 of 2014 and the contract for statewide e-filing in Texas, which was signed in the third quarter of 2013. Excluding these two items, the trailing 12-month bookings rose 11.6%. Digging a little deeper into this quarter's bookings, there are a couple of factors to point out. First, as we mentioned earlier, we signed a new fixed price e-filing contract with the State of Indiana which contributed about $20 million of bookings this quarter. As a reminder, our e-filing contracts other than Texas and now Indiana are transaction-based generally with a fee for filing and future revenue streams from those arrangements are not included in bookings and backlog. Second, maintenance bookings declined slightly this quarter from the second quarter of last year. This is not the result of attrition, but rather it is because last year's second quarter maintenance bookings included more than $7 million of maintenance agreements which extend beyond the normal one-year term, several of which were related to the new California courts projects. As a result they contributed unusually large bookings in Q2 last year, but did not renew or contribute to bookings this quarter. Some of those will renew and should open bookings in the fourth quarter of this year and some are multi-year agreements that will renew in 2016 or 2017. As John noted earlier, and as we've frequently discussed in the past, these puts and takes all illustrate that it's simply the nature of our business that bookings are often lumpy. This is especially true with respect to large contracts for which revenue recognition often takes place over several quarters or even years. We signed 25 new contracts in the second quarter that included software licenses greater than $100,000, and those contracts had an average license of $484,000, compared to 43 new contracts with an average license value of $867,000 in the second quarter of 2014. Again, last year's comparison includes 12 contracts with courts in California. Based on our performance in the first half of 2015 and our outlook for the balance of the year, we have raised our earnings guidance for 2015 from our revised guidance in April. We're currently expecting 2015 revenues will be between $575 million and $581 million. We expect 2015 diluted GAAP EPS will be approximately $1.97 to $2.05. We expect 2015 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be approximately $2.50 to $2.58. For the year, estimated non-cash share-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $20 million to $20.5 million. Fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between 36 million and 36.5 million shares. We estimate an effective tax rate for 2015 between 37% and 38%. The tax rate and share count each are affected by the timing and volume of stock option exercises. We expect our total capital expenditures will be approximately $13.5 million to $14.5 million for the year. Total depreciation and amortization is expected to be between $15.5 million and $16 million, including approximately $6.7 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to John for further comments.
John S. Marr Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thanks Brian. Market conditions in the second quarter generally continued the trends we've seen for the last several quarters and activity in local government market is good. Our bookings and revenue growth for the last several quarters are clearly well in excess of the market as we continue to gain share and expand our market leadership position. Our competitive position remains very strong across all our major product lines and win rates are high, reflecting both the long-term commitment to product development, and the consistently high level of execution on our engagements. While there are obviously a lot of moving parts with respect to our bookings, and a number of factors that contribute to lumpiness in contract signings, we remain very confident that the combination of our existing backlog, the pipeline, and new business opportunities, and our market leading competitive position continue to support our growth objectives. As mentioned earlier, we benefited from a significant deal on the Dynamics side of our business, and fortunately this was incremental to a broader set of business that was experienced in the quarter. The direction of Microsoft royalties continues to trend upward, and as we've discussed previously, our renegotiations with Microsoft suggest that we will have a significantly lower expense level in the future as well and then net results will be positive. Now, we'll take your questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Charlie Strauzer of CJS Securities.
Charles Strauzer - CJS Securities, Inc.: Hi, good morning.
John S. Marr Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning.
Charles Strauzer - CJS Securities, Inc.: John, if you can talk a little bit more on the Microsoft Dynamics subject that you just mentioned. I know it's tough to kind of predict kind of visibility you're looking out beyond may be a quarter or two quarters. But when you look at the pipeline or proposals that are tracking – that you're tracking out there, kind of the RFPs that are out there. Are you encouraged by what you're seeing on your side of the business, obviously you can't tell from your VAR partners out there, but give us a little bit more color if you can on the pipeline?
John S. Marr Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Sure. Well, I think as we know over the last couple of years, this certainly hasn't been explosive. It's been a little slower ramp may be than Microsoft expected and to some degree of what we may have even expected. But I think our sales channel is maturing, the product is settling into really what I call kind of sub-segments of the marketplace where it may have advantages and it'd be particularly strong. And we've got a pretty good pipe around that, and as part of this kind of reorganization, we're really transitioning from a predominately R&D role in terms of our relationship with Microsoft that initial product is well-build though and exists; it's actually relatively matured. And so our role will shift where we'll have a kind of lighter presence on the R&D side. They still have a significant R&D staff and will continue to invest significantly in the product. But I think our experience on the sales, marketing, and even service side is now where we add value to these arrangements. So we have a pretty good pipeline. We would expect not to have tremendously broad footprint with this product. I think that our direct sales will be again in the sub-verticals where we think it's particularly competitive. And I think a lot of our focus will be supporting their partners, and building out their sales channels, and targeting sub-verticals that each of them are focused on an helping them become more productive. Ultimately, our objective is that the revenue stream from Microsoft is largely complementary; meaning international, the significant deal in this quarter was a Federal DoD, Department that we would not have pursued with our proprietary product. So much of our sales focus will be – in addition to our direct sales will be in supporting their partners build a strong presence in that marketplace.
Charles Strauzer - CJS Securities, Inc.: That's helpful. Thank you. And then shifting just from my follow-up to the guidance, if you could give a little bit more granularity on the segment level in the back half of the year? And also you know just looking at particularly in appraisal, it looks like you're kind of at historically high levels in terms of revenue. How should we expect that to ramp also?
John S. Marr Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, it's really across the board. In our courts and justice division, results year-to-date are ahead of plan, and none of that's being given back in the second half. It is not timing, it's just out-performance. So they are ahead of plan. Our ERP Group, which is led by Munis, with other sub-divisions under it, has been ahead of plan, especially on earnings. And again, it's not timing, it's expected to continue throughout the balance of the year. Most of our local government division is, there is a couple kind of smaller growth areas there that are small enough that they are still little lumpy, so that – it is any areas that aren't had a plan, simply those, and that's against smaller units that are going to be a little lumpier. And as you indicated, the appraisal services is cyclically strong at this point in time. So it's really across the board, and as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, it isn't really a reflection of the marketplace. The market is healthy. I think since the post 2008-2009 dip, as we've said, has recovered to somewhat normal levels, but we really do continue to make meaningful gains in our competitive position. Our win rates are strong. And to some degree, where meaningful competitors are not that involved in the new business market at this point in time. I'd be cautious in saying that, while it's very encouraging, because there certainly are some individually strong competitors up in the marketplace that have improved as well. But again on balance, there are fewer competitors in the space. They're certainly our traditional competitors we've had that may be have become a little more legacy-oriented or in some cases left the new business market completely. So for us those are really the big wins. Obviously, winning a deal is important, but the big wins are when you really do put some distance between you and what were our previously strong direct competitors, and the level of investment that we're able to make at this point in time in relation to the smaller players in this space.
Charles Strauzer - CJS Securities, Inc.: Excellent. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Alex Zukin of Stephens.
Alex J. Zukin - Stephens, Inc.: Yeah. Hey guys. Congratulations on the quarter. A couple of questions for me. First one, just a clarifying question; Brian, that $7 million in maintenance renewal bookings that you called out, was that part of the $64 million California bookings from last year, or is that incremental to that?
Brian K. Miller - Executive Vice President - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: Some of it was included in that, so that included some California bookings. I don't know exactly how much of it, but I'd say, on the order of, is probably more than half of it was from those California deals.
Alex J. Zukin - Stephens, Inc.: Got it. And then on Brazos, can you guys talk about how much is expected to contribute to revenues this year?
Brian K. Miller - Executive Vice President - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: It's somewhere around $3.5 million in the second half of the year. Some of – because Brazos' revenues last year were around $10 million, but because we were a partner of theirs and some of their revenues actually flowed-through us and were included in our revenues as third-party sales. So all of that $10 million isn't incremental to revenues we already have in the plan. So a net increase of around $3.5 million in the second half of the year.
Alex J. Zukin - Stephens, Inc.: Got it. And then could you maybe walk through some of the puts and takes on cash flow performance in the quarter. It was a little bit – I realized, you don't guide to the number, it was a little bit below our numbers and consensus. So just, you know, I wanted to see if you can just talk about the puts and takes?
Brian K. Miller - Executive Vice President - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: Well, I think the biggest difference this quarter was the cash tax payment. So last year in the second quarter, and clearly, our cash flow was better this year in Q2 than it was last year in Q2. But in the first half of the year, we paid about $10 million more, most of that in the second quarter in cash tax payments than last year. Last year, we had more of a benefit in the first half of the year from offsetting cash payments from stock option exercises. This year we didn't realize that same benefit in the first half, and we'll see what happens in the second half depending on the level of option exercise that could benefit our cash flow more in the second half. I guess to some extent although most of those wouldn't be collected yet, the maintenance billings that we talked about also will affect cash flow, and let's say, pushed it a little higher last year, some of that second quarter's more in the third quarter. But the taxes are the biggest piece.
Alex J. Zukin - Stephens, Inc.: Got it. That's helpful. And then John, maybe can you just talk a little bit, I know you touched on this on the comments, but if I put the 3% bookings growth, I realize the lumpiness in bookings in context with kind of the raise in the guidance. What gives you that confidence as you look at your pipeline, as you look at your business to raise the numbers there?
John S. Marr Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, obviously we're talking about the second half of the year that we're in. Our sales processes are long, so certainly almost all the business we expect to see this quarter is relatively certain. It's a matter of execution which isn't to be taken for granted for good visibility. And at this point, it is some deals that it's a matter of timing in the fourth quarter, but you know these things pretty well. I know it's important for us to report bookings and backlog, and I think over a longer period of time, it's important for you folks to focus on those trends directionally. But I wouldn't read too much into a single quarter. Largely big deals, and there was one in Indiana in the quarter. Big deals can drive it up, as well as multi-year SaaS deals. So if we do a traditional on-premise account, the only thing that goes in the backlog is the initial implementation. We don't sign seven year maintenance agreements even though they are near certain to occur, whereas if we sign a seven year SaaS deal, seven years of revenue goes into the backlog. So there are a number of big deals, multi-year SaaS deals, a number of other things that kind of sway that number around. And again, over a long period of time that all gets normalized, but I'd just be cautious about over-focusing on it in a quarter. And as I said, we've got very good visibility as for the deal mix in balance of the year. And there are some bigger deals in it, and there are also – well, the second quarter was a little light on SaaS deals, again it's just deal mix and timing. We know that there will be strong number of SaaS deals in the second half of the year that are multi-year, and well, raise the bookings and the backlog. So again, we feel that the trends that have been established over the last couple of years are largely in place. And I think the beat in the second quarter was not timing, and with the visibility we have in that, in the books at this point, we think the direction will continue.
Alex J. Zukin - Stephens, Inc.: That's helpful. And then just a last one from me. John, just wanted to ask you, which one of your newer initiatives are you guys most excited about? I mean you clearly have a lot of growth irons in the fire, with record holdings and criminal justice and the new Brazos stuff. So just wondering what's top off mind for you right now strategically?
John S. Marr Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, not to (30:16) and I'll give you a short answer. But the way we run the company is to try to do that across the board. So obviously courts and justice has had a great run, and is a very strong leader, and we're very excited about their opportunities going forward, turning case management into more of an integrated criminal justice suite, building out the e-filing opportunities that we have. But that same kind of focus is certainly isn't because we're having that success that we have released in other areas of the business. We're a strong company financially as you know. We're looking for places to make investments, and we're raising the level of investment we're making in products like Munis that are well-established, and then strong leadership position. But we feel it's appropriate to reinvest a percentage of those incremental revenues back into the product, and their experience is strong. Probably the fastest growing – smaller unit, but fastest growing and a good catalyst for growth down the road – is EnerGov department. You know we don't get too granular with those numbers, but it's fair to say that company has far more than doubled in revenues in the two years it's been on board, and emerging as a real leader in that space as well. So we're excited about that. So again, we try to look at the whole range of applications, and really we're not looking at where we can tighten things up. We're exercising this with discipline, but we really are looking at, in each of those suites, what types of timely investments can we make to improve their competitive positions and ensure that they can sustain the growth they're on.
Alex J. Zukin - Stephens, Inc.: Perfect. Thank you, guys.
Operator: The next question comes from Brian Kinstlinger of Maxim Group.
Josh Seide - Maxim Group, LLC.: Hi, this is actually Josh Seide for Brian. Can you remind us about the court CMS market opportunity in Australia? How many RFPs may come out over the next six to nine months? And are there new competitors that you otherwise don't see in U.S.? Thanks.
John S. Marr Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, there is only one, as far as – from what I know, there is one active engagement that we're involved in now. And you know one of the reasons we entered the marketplace, we've got a strong partnership that we've invested in, and we do believe that, you know there isn't any Tyler, so to speak, in that marketplace. There is no clear leader with a complete offering like what we have. So there again isn't a single competitor that we'd name to you that is someone we need to kind of overcome. We feel it's a market that doesn't have a leader like that, and it's right for someone to come in, make an investment and establish themselves. So obviously it's English speaking. The courts operations are very similar to U.S., and there is a market opportunity as there's a need for someone to come in and invest in that. So currently there is just one active engagement, but we believe that if we're able to get established that there will be, you know, a number of opportunities there.
Josh Seide - Maxim Group, LLC.: Okay. And just as a follow-up; can you give us some sense of the deal sizes for Australia opportunities?
John S. Marr Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, you know, it's like here, there could be some deals that are, you know, less than $1 million and maybe some deals that are $5 million, $6 million, $8 million dollars. I don't think there are $20 million deals. I think the entire market opportunity is in the area of the size of Texas. So a larger U.S. state is basically what we're adding incrementally to our addressable market space.
Josh Seide - Maxim Group, LLC.: That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Peter Lowry of JMP Securities.
Peter C. Lowry - JMP Securities LLC: Hi John, hey Brian, nice quarter. Can you talk about how you think about your capital allocation strategy currently?
John S. Marr Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Obviously, the balance sheet has built significantly over the last couple of years. We are very focused, I think traditionally, meaning literally over the last 10 or 12 years, Tyler's done a good job in having quality earnings backed up by their cash flow. And we've had great opportunities to turn that cash into strong shareholder value through repurchase of our own shares and good acquisitions and ongoing investments in our products. As you saw, we bought a little stock in the quarter. We would have bought more had we had more opportunity at that level. So we'll continue to be opportunistic there, and be aggressive when it hits the numbers that we feel we should be investing at. Our M&A strategy has evolved. We aren't as focused on smaller consolidation plays, the things that were important in the early years to get established as a leader, to broaden our addressable marketplace, to bring in subject matter experts, to increase our recurring revenue and customer base, and all of those things; we feel we've kind of hit the critical mass point there. And so I think you could say our standards have gone up, which means we'll find deals less frequently, but those deals that do meet our standards could be larger in size. So I wouldn't look at our strong balance sheet at this point in any way as a negative thing; I think it positions us very, very well to act on what could be more meaningful opportunities when they present themselves. So that's a strategy that you need to be patient on, but we certainly don't want to be here three, four, five years from now with the kind of cash in relation to our size that you see in some tech companies. We are very actively looking for in a disciplined fashion ways to deploy capital that will create shareholder value. And then lastly, as I indicated I think on the prepared remarks, or one of the earlier questions, we are investing at a higher level. I don't think that will necessarily put a lot of pressure on earnings, because with the kind of growth we have and the incremental margins that come in that growth, it's really just redeploying what we get out of these new revenues back into of the product. So it won't necessarily eat into our balance sheet or our cash position. But we are actively identifying and investing in incremental proprietary investment opportunities within our own product suites.
Peter C. Lowry - JMP Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then how are we going to measure the success of EverGuide? Is it as simple as just customer retention or are there different metrics you might look at? And are there any early indications of success there?
John S. Marr Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, it's really taking shape now. So I don't think there's early indications. But you know maybe one thing that the investment community takes a little bit for granted it is that Tyler kind of chugs along nicely, and that's not easy. And I think to take for granted that would be a mistake. So yeah, we have incredibly high retention, literally less than 2%, probably at or under 1% in terms of names. So very, very low, and you could say, well, that's great, and check that box. But what we see is, we have many clients now that are 10 years, 15 years, 20 years with us, which means they may have almost all of their staff having turned over in that period of time. Much of their staff never trained on the product. So the people have changed those sites and the product every five years, six years, seven years is entirely different than it was five years, six years, seven years previously. So even if the same people are there, they've really never been trained and may not fully appreciate what's in the product they have. So evergreen for some time now has provided them with all of the updates. There's no relicensing, we never resell into an account, and that's very well received. But just because we provide them with new technology, and new functionality, and higher quality products doesn't mean that they're being well-utilized at that site. And we can actually go to sites and they can think they need this or need that, and may be they have new leadership that just assumed and they've had the system 15 years, 20 years, they need to go out and get a product that has that, and they don't even appreciate may be that it's in that product. And EverGuide really takes evergreen to another level where there will be supplementary services, there will be online and training devices, there will be a lot of things that we continually try to add value into their core arrangement with us. And I think we're compensated well to do that, and it's in our interest to do that. And there are also be incremental services that they can contract for at incremental cost in order to do that. So it's a recognition that just because we provide them with updated technology and functionality, it doesn't automatically get used, and the site needs to be challenged to invest in that and we need to step-up and support that process as well. So I think we're trying to stay ahead of, you know, the atrophy that can occur in an implementation that gets stale over time.
Peter C. Lowry - JMP Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Tim Klasell of Northland Securities.
Tim E. Klasell - Northland Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Hey, good morning everybody. Just, you touched on briefly the large deal you did in the quarter, hoping that it was that relative to, let's say, the Odyssey deal from this quarter last year?
John S. Marr Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: A large deal in the quarter was, Indiana's e-file deal was around – it was $20 million to be recognized over five years, and the total contracts in Q2 of 2014 in California, I think was $64 million, certainly right around that. Yeah...
Tim E. Klasell - Northland Securities, Inc.: Okay
John S. Marr Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: ...$64 million.
Tim E. Klasell - Northland Securities, Inc.: Yeah. That's helpful. And then Brazos, how does that do relative to expectations in the quarter?
John S. Marr Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, it's just a little teeny bit, and it get closed in the remaining weeks. So I think there's only a few hundred thousand dollars in the quarter, so it's insignificant.
Tim E. Klasell - Northland Securities, Inc.: Okay.
Brian K. Miller - Executive Vice President - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: It was only in there – it closed May 29. It was only in for a month of a quarter, so didn't have any kind of a meaningful impact.
Tim E. Klasell - Northland Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Great. That's all I had. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Scott Berg of Needham.
Scott Berg - Needham & Co. LLC: Hi, John and Brian, congrats on a good quarter. I have two questions. First of all, John the statewide e-file deal that was announced in the quarter, that's your second one with a fixed fee is; I guess it's a two-part question. One, what is the likelihood of additional opportunities on that fixed fee nature going forward? And then two, does that contract do you think it guarantees you more revenues, or may be reduces some of the upside of the transactional nature of the rest of the businesses?
John S. Marr Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I guess both. So fundamentally, we look at this as a quick business. And we'll continue to protect that. We will not license the product, it's a quick Software-as-a-Service kind of business. Having said that, we recognize that our vertical likes to have certainty in their cost. So when we do go to a fixed fee basis, it is completely the result of projections on what those volumes will be in just converting it into fixed fee so that they have visibility on what their cost are. And I think if we are a vertical software company, then we need to appreciate the market we're in and be to responsive to what works for them. I think in the short-term, the answer is both, meaning that if their actual volumes are a little higher, then we may come up a little short, and if their actual volumes are little lower then we may come out on the good. But these are, obviously in all these states have been established and if that courts for a very, very long-time, then the volatility is within a relatively tight range. If their actual experience, you know, were outside that range for whatever reason, then I think the second generation of those contracts would reflect that. But I think it's a tight range. And I don't think they're going experience filings or case volumes that are dramatically different than what they've been experiencing for years.
Brian K. Miller - Executive Vice President - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: And Scott, Indiana is a little different in the way they approaches most of our e-filing clients in most cases, and that includes Texas with the fixed price range, but in most cases, the users, the attorneys are actually paying filings with each transaction or in the case of Texas with a case as a whole. Indiana is actually funding an out of state fund, so rather than charging the users that's coming out of the states' budget. So that I believe drove them more towards wanting to have a fixed price arrangement. But if you look at the pricing on Indiana, what we're getting relative to the number of cases we expected to generate is very similar on a per case basis to what we see in other jurisdictions.
Scott Berg - Needham & Co. LLC: Got it. And then one follow-up for me Brian is on the gross margins around Professional Services. Obviously, you've hired a lot lately to service the contracts, you know, the large uptake of the California courts and justice deals over the 12 months in particular, along with some ERPs. But when do we start getting some leverage from that, and I when does that hiring slow a little bit? Is that a back half of 2015 opportunity or you're just thinking about that more in the first half of 2016?
Brian K. Miller - Executive Vice President - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: I think we start to see the leverage more in the first half of 2016. Our hiring does slow down in the last two quarters, at least the plans are for the second half of the year for us to add around 150 net heads, and we added around 200 in the first half of the year. So it slows a bit, and particularly, as you get into the fourth quarter, but I think you really start to see that reflected in more of an uptick in margins as you get to the beginning of next year.
Scott Berg - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. That's all I have. Thanks for taking the questions.
Operator: The next question comes from Jonathan Ho of William Blair & Company.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Congratulations on the strong quarter. I just wanted to understand a little bit more; so just relative to the California contracts that you've won last year, can you maybe update us in terms of how far along you are in terms of completing those projects? And maybe your thoughts around sort of follow-on opportunities from counties that you've already won?
John S. Marr Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, a number of them are live, but I think all of them continue to have considerable work left and considerable dollars that remain in backlog. Some of these projects are bigger than others, so again some go live in say, eight months to 12 months and some that could be a two year or three year process. So certainly still in the relatively early stages of all that business that was won. We mentioned, as an example, and we've said before that a lot of these deals, you know, the $64 million that we booked in Q2 of 2014 doesn't take all those counties out of play in terms of opportunities. There are still significant opportunities in those counties, some of them were a single case type and have several other case types that are potential opportunities for us and other applications as well. So I think most of these counties have an objective to have an Integrated Criminal Justice Solution in place, but most of them started with something that's a subset of that. So the significant work that remains from the original engagement, but probably more significantly there are significant other opportunities like the one we mentioned with Kern County with a signed $5 million follow-on to add other case types and other applications for the project.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it.
John S. Marr Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And they are high level. We believe the total market opportunity for the Integrated Criminal Justice, all those other applications beyond Case Management is roughly equal size to the Case Management opportunity. So for example, in Kern County, I believe our initial deal there was around $4.5 million and this add-on was close to $5 million. So it kind of illustrates that there are similar sized opportunities.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. And then just relative to sort of AMCAD's exit to the market, have you started to see, now that we're pretty far long in that process, more interest from their existing customer base in terms of switching over, or at least early indications? I just want to get a sense of where that might be tracking in terms of competitive displacement?
John S. Marr Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, it's been (48:36) I think one account, we may have signed last quarter and others watching that, and there were some kind of correlations established of their clients to kind of see if they could somehow sustain the product. And we see chinks in that armor, and who knows, but we just don't see that as a very long-term viable option for those accounts. So we picked up a couple may be. We watched the others closely, and I think some of them are trying to see if there is a viable path for them and there is a lot that goes around maintaining these products and supporting them that will make that difficult and we'll continue to watch it closely.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. And then just one last one on my side. In terms of the Dynamics opportunity you guys had talked in the past about may be shifting some of the spending away from the R&D side and more to the go-to-market strategy side. Is that still sort of the current thinking or can you give us an updated view on where the investments may go going forward? Thank you.
John S. Marr Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. We continue to work on details kind of structuring a new arrangement that's more representative of our relationship once the product's now deployed versus when it was in pre-release R&D. And obviously, in those early years, we brought value in bringing that vertical expertise to the product. That's largely reflected in the product, and so our involvement on the R&D side will be quite down significantly. Some of those resources will be redeployed and are being redeployed on the sale side and that's not all direct sales, a reasonable amount of those resources will – we have a lot of experience in RFPs, and demos, and managing these marketplaces, and all of these things that some of their very capable partners may not have that vertically oriented expertise, and we will have a team that supports that and our interest for them to build out that channel. So yeah, high level our R&D spend will come down significantly. Our sales and sales support spend will go up. We'll continue to build out some to degree of service business that we have established there. But the net net of it will be a reduction in total spend probably in the 50% range, so a significant reduction in total spend.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Matt Williams of Evercore ISI.
Matthew Lee Williams - Evercore Group LLC: Hi, guys. I'm actually on for Kirk this morning. Most of our questions have been answered at this point, but maybe just two for me. I guess, number one, just with the Public Safety offering that's in the Brazos acquisition. How should we think about how you're sort of going to go after this public sector market? Is there a lot of integration with some of your existing product areas that we should expect, or is this business going to be more of a sort of standalone business that's maybe a little less integrated with some of your other offerings? Just trying to get a sense on that.
John S. Marr Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I'd say it's a process. And we've been in this process for some time, but I would say this is an area that we can see accelerated growth and a stronger presence than what we've had traditionally. So Brazos – mobile is a big leader. It's a lot of color and decisions these days, and having a very strong mobile-first kind of approach is exciting through our Public Safety offering. In terms of standalone, no, I think we see our Public Safety offering, we enjoy a very strong leadership position in courts and justice. And I think as we grow our Public Safety position that we have the opportunity to have a complete end-to-end criminal justice solution that doesn't exist. The competitors for the most part that we compete with in courts are different than the competitors we compete with in Public Safety, and if we're able to have an integrated leadership position in both of those areas, there is very meaningful information that can come from that that's more difficult to produce from disintegrated systems. So that is a big part of our strategy there.
Matthew Lee Williams - Evercore Group LLC: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just one more on e-filing. Obviously, outside of the TexFile arrangement, the other component of e-filing revenue continues to sort of accelerate. I am just curious sort of what other states or locations are sort of driving some of the non-TexFile e-filing growth? And I guess as a sort of follow-on to the Indiana deal, when should we expect that to start to contribute going forward? I assume it will be somewhat of a gradual roll-out, similar to TexFile; but any color on timing there would be great.
Brian K. Miller - Executive Vice President - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: Yeah, Indiana actually started this quarter with a small amount of revenues, about $100,000. It ramps up over the next year; I think it's about $1.5 million this year, and – I'm sorry, yeah it's $1.5 million this year, $3.5 million next year, and then $5 million a year in 2017, 2018 and 2019. So after end of the second, it ramps up to I think $650,000 a quarter in the last two quarters of the year. Most of the other revenues in the e-filing is – growth right now, there is – beyond Indiana, the big contributor in the second half of the year, we start to see some e-filing revenues in some of the California counties in the second half of the year. Most of those are smaller volume counties, so it's not going to be as significant, but it's going to be sort of a gradual ramp up in those counties. The other statewide implementations where we've got e-filing, places like Oregon, Rhode Island, Maryland, are all still in a kind of a ramp up phase. So it's more gradual with respect to most of our clients right now other than Indiana.
Matthew Lee Williams - Evercore Group LLC: Great. Thanks for taking the questions.
Operator: The next question comes from Kevin Liu of B. Riley & Company.
Kevin Liu - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning. Just one question from me. With respect to the Dynamics deal in the Federal sector you secured this quarter, is it your sense that there are other large opportunities within either the DoD or other agencies in Federal that you're aware of, or do you think this is more of a one-off opportunity?
John S. Marr Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Simple answer is, we don't know. As we've said, we really have very little visibility to this marketplace and what comes to us indirectly through Microsoft. I think it's reasonable to think that winning a significant deal at the federal level is the result of a concerted effort to secure business there. And if they execute well on this project, you would certainly think and hope that it wouldn't be a one-off. So the encouraging – and this has not been explosive, but I think the encouraging thing is that the direction of the royalties largely is up, and the footprint of the market that they have established, even though it hasn't exploded, is very broad. Internationally, I mean I think there were 18 countries on a royalty report this past quarter. That's typical, that the deals from 12, 15, 18 countries, different levels of government, federal governments, state and local governments, complementary public sector businesses, universities, transit authorities, things like that. So yeah, we would hope and we would expect that if they have a successful significant engagement at the federal level, that they didn't establish that presence for a single deal, that that's something that they expect to be repeatable.
Kevin Liu - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Got it. And actually if I could sneak one more in. Just with respect to the Microsoft negotiations going on now, if you do shift more of your resources towards the sales and service side, is there an opportunity to also claim a higher royalty rate, or would you expect that piece of the partnership to remain unchanged?
John S. Marr Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Royalty rates are pretty well-established for a very long period of time. We don't get too granular on the agreement, but many, many, many years. And the changes from the original arrangement we expect will be, if there are, will be very modest. So they can change very modestly based on our resource commitment and a number of other variables, but now largely the royalty rates are established and will be relatively stable over a long period of time.
Kevin Liu - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks for taking the questions.
Operator: The next question will come from Mark Schappel of Benchmark.
Mark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Hi, good morning. And thanks for taking my question. Nice job on the quarter. Brian, just one question for you; I'm just wondering if you could just repeat your comments in your prepared remarks with respect to last year's maintenance bookings?
Brian K. Miller - Executive Vice President - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: With respect to last year's maintenance booking?
Mark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Yeah, if I call correctly, there were two main issues, not issues, but two main things you addressed with respect to maintenance bookings. One had to do with the Indiana e-filing contribution and the other had to do with, I guess, something that happened last year at this time with maintenance bookings?
Brian K. Miller - Executive Vice President - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: Last year in Q2 we had about $7 million – more than $7 million of maintenance agreements that went into bookings that were longer than our normal one-year term. So with a normal one-year maintenance booking last year in Q2, that would have renewed and showed up for the same or greater amount this year in Q2, because those extend for in some cases 18 months, some cases multi-year. If you didn't get that renewal this year in Q2, some of those will renew in the fourth quarter of this year, so they were 18 month initial agreements. Some of those were multi-year agreements that we won't see the renewal again until 2016 or 2017. So they'll work off their initial arrangement. So that creates a little bit of a mismatch in the comparison.
Mark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Robert Moses of RGM Capital.
Robert Glyn Moses - RGM Capital LLC: Morning.
John S. Marr Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Rob.
Robert Glyn Moses - RGM Capital LLC: Just a couple questions and really a clarification on one. So you know we've talked a lot about kind of the lumpiness of the orders, but just trying to put this in perspective. If you did around $179 million just going back over the last, I don't know, three or so years, it seems like it's kind of second highest by a pretty wide margin. Am I thinking about this right, because I think that seem like about a $100 million to $150 million type of number, so it's still relatively significant in terms of the total dollar value?
Brian K. Miller - Executive Vice President - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: You are correct. If you go back over the last two years other than second quarter of last year, that's still the highest bookings quarter in the last two years.
Robert Glyn Moses - RGM Capital LLC: Okay.
Brian K. Miller - Executive Vice President - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: So yes, even though it's down from last year's Q2 and there are some moving parts in there, it is still the second best bookings quarter in the last two years.
Robert Glyn Moses - RGM Capital LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then John, I know this is really tough to comment on, but just M&A environment in general. They are very disciplined historically, I assume they're going to remain so. But just given, you know, what happened to the economy a few years ago and we're at today and given the valuation of the stock market, would you say the M&A environment things you're looking at is about the same as its been the last year or is it more aggressive, less aggressive, just a sense?
John S. Marr Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, it's probably about the same. And as I said, our strategy has evolved and I think it's actually is more selective, more likely to do strategic and consolidation opportunities which theoretically could provide higher values on deals. If you look at EnerGov or if you look at our e-file, these acquisitions, really why you want to be disciplined on value that certainly can support higher valuation given how they perform once in the Tyler company. So there's deals out there, you know, (01:02:08) markets flush with cash, and there are cases where valuation, I think, it's out of the neighborhood that we're comfortable in. But its reasonably active. It's just instead of doing a deal or two deals a quarter, we're probably more likely to do fewer deals that could be more significant in size.
Robert Glyn Moses - RGM Capital LLC: Good. Thanks for the color.
John S. Marr Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay.
Operator: At this time, there appear to be no more questions. Mr. Marr, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.
John S. Marr Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Right. Well, thank you very much for joining us on the call today. And if there are any further questions, then feel free to reach out to Brian or myself. Have a great day.
Operator: This call is concluded. You may disconnect.

===== 2015 Q1  (2015-04-25 10:00:00) =====
Executives: John Marr - President and Chief Executive Officer Brian Miller - Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: Alex Zukin - Stephens Jonathan Ho - William Blair Kevin Liu - B. Riley & Company
Operator: Hello and welcome to today’s Tyler Technologies’ First Quarter 2015 Conference Call. Your host for today’s call is John Marr, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, April 23, 2015. I would like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Marr. Sir, please go ahead.
John Marr: Thank you, Jamie and welcome to our first quarter 2015 earnings call. With me on the call today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I would like for Brian to give the Safe Harbor statement. Next, I will have some preliminary comments. Brian will review the details of our first quarter operating results and 2015 guidance, then I will have some final comments and we will take your questions. Brian?
Brian Miller: Thanks, John. During the course of this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information that may include projections concerning the company’s future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause the actual results to differ materially from these projections. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Also, please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. John?
John Marr: Thanks, Brian. Our first quarter financial performance built upon a strong year in 2014. From an historical perspective, this was our sixth straight quarter of revenue growth greater than 15%. Software license and royalty revenues were up 27% and at $14.3 million were the highest in company history. Our 23% growth in recurring revenues from subscription reflects continued growth in our e-filing revenues from courts as well as a continuing gradual shift toward cloud-based software-as-a-service business. We had another very solid quarter for bookings, which were up 22%. On a trailing 12-month basis, bookings increased 13%. However, bookings were up 31%, with the Texas e-filing contract considered on a comparable basis to other transaction-based e-filing arrangements. We continue to sign more multi-suite agreements for integrated Tyler solutions. In the first quarter, we signed two such agreements, which included our Munis ERP, Incode court case management and EnerGov planning regulatory and maintenance solutions. With Bristol, Tennessee, we have signed a 7-year SaaS agreement in the town of Addison, Texas in the Dallas metropolitan area. In Courts & Justice for our Odyssey court case management solution, we signed agreements with the Superior Court of California, County of San Mateo. The County of San Mateo chose Odyssey in 2014 for criminal and juvenile delinquency cases. And based on its positive experience has now added Odyssey throughout its traffic, civil, family law, probate, small claims, adoption and juvenile dependency divisions. Other notable agreements for Odyssey included Brazos County, Texas, a former MCAD client, and a SaaS agreement with the Texas counties of Harrison and Chambers. In our e-filing business, Fulton County became the 11th and largest metro Atlanta County to select our Odyssey eFile Georgia solution. Each county in Georgia can independently propose mandatory e-filing requirements. Fulton County is the first to do so with mandatory e-filing for all civil cases in state courts starting on June 1, 2015. Gwinnett County and the Metropolitan Court Clerks Association also selected our eFile Georgia solution in the quarter. We announced an enhanced product suite for our EnerGov planning, regulatory and maintenance solution. The public maintenance management suite offers modules for asset management, work order and maintenance management, request management, inspections and investigations and inventory management. It can configure automated task, spatially mapped assets and affiliate them to designated sources, and track information to assure assets and costs are accurate. Our EnerGov product continues to gain momentum in the marketplace. In addition to the multi-suite agreements with other Tyler products, we signed new EnerGov contracts in Q1 with Miami-Dade County, Florida, a SaaS agreement with Tustin, California. In appraisal and tax, the Dallas Central Appraisal District of Dallas County, Texas, signed an agreement for mass appraisal services using Tyler Verify. Significant first quarter contracts for our Munis ERP solution included agreements with Pinellas Park, Florida and Bend, Oregon and a SaaS arrangement with big county schools in Georgia. Major contracts for our iasWorld appraisal and tax solution include Lake County of Ohio and Erie County, Pennsylvania as well as a SaaS agreement with Chatham County, Georgia. Now I would like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and update our annual guidance for 2015.
Brian Miller: Thanks John. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2015. I am going to provide additional data on the quarter’s performance and review our guidance for 2015. Then we will move on to John’s comments on the current quarter and our outlook for 2015. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with the peers in the software industry. Our non-GAAP earnings exclude share-based compensation expense, the employer portion of the payroll taxes on employee stock transactions and amortization of acquired intangibles. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. Revenues for the first quarter were $135 million, up 19.8% with 19.2% organic growth. Software license and royalty revenues increased 27.3% and this was the ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in licenses. In Q1, we received $850,000 of royalties on public sector sales of Microsoft Dynamics AX by other Microsoft VARs, up from $659,000 a year ago. Subscriptions increased 23.3%. We added 32 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 19 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $22.2 million in total contract value, which was more than three times the total SaaS contract value of approximately $7.2 million in the first quarter of 2014. In Q1 of last year, we added 32 new subscription-based arrangements and had 15 on-premises conversions. SaaS clients represented approximately 28% of our new software clients in the quarter compared to 27% in the prior year quarter. Q1 2015 SaaS contract value represented 43% of the total contract value signed compared to 17% in Q1 of 2014 The fastest growing subscription-based revenue stream is from e-filing for courts and online payments. These revenues increased 28.5% to $9.6 million from $7.5 million last year. Total e-filing revenue of $7.3 million this quarter grew 30.4% over last year, with 55% of that increase related to our Texas e-filing contract, which contributed $4.8 million of revenues this quarter. Our blended gross margin for the quarter improved 70 basis points to 47.3%, mainly due to strong license and royalty revenue growth and leverage in our recurring revenues. Our non-GAAP gross margin also rose by 70 basis points to 48.2%. SG&A expense increased 12.5% in the quarter and was 21.1% of total revenues, a decrease of 140 basis points from last year’s first quarter. Excluding non-cash share-based compensation expense, SG&A expense increased 11.5%, well below revenue growth of 19.8% for the quarter. Operating income was $27.2 million, an increase of 36.8%. Non-GAAP operating income was $33.1 million, up 32.7%. The non-GAAP operating margin improved 230 basis points to 24.5%, as we obtained substantial leverage for both SG&A and R&D expenses. Net income rose 45.4% to $17.3 million or $0.48 per diluted share. The fully diluted share count increased by approximately 395,000 shares. Our effective tax rate was 36.9% and benefited from a higher qualified manufacturing activities deduction. It is likely that our effective tax rate will rise during the year, if stock option exercises generate significant excess tax benefits that limit this deduction. Free cash flow was negative $4 million compared to $12.9 million in last year’s first quarter. The comparison to last year’s first quarter cash flow was impacted by the timing of maintenance billings in the fourth quarter of 2014, which accelerated some cash receipts into Q4 that would have otherwise been in this quarter’s cash flow. Cash payments for accrued incentive compensation and cash tax payments were also higher in this year’s first quarter than last year. In last year’s first quarter, it included unusually large cash collections related to milestone billings on certain contracts. Day sales outstanding in accounts receivable were 71 days at March 31, 2015 compared to 66 days at March 31, 2014. DSOs decreased sequentially from 80 days at December 31, which is our normal seasonal trend related to the timing of maintenance billings. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $689.6 million, up 27.6% from last year’s Q1. Software-related backlog, which excludes backlog from appraisal services contracts, was $633.4 million, a 24.5% increase. Backlog included $137.9 million of maintenance compared to $117 million a year ago. Subscription backlog was $208.4 million compared to $183.2 million last year and included approximately $46.6 million related to the Texas e-filing contract. Our bookings for the quarter, which are calculated from the change in backlog plus revenues, were $123 million, up 21.9% from last year’s first quarter. We have previously discussed how our bookings are often somewhat lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, especially with respect to large contracts for which revenues are often recognized over several quarters or even years. For the 12 months ended March 31, bookings rose 13.4% over the prior 12-month period. These bookings include the contract for statewide e-filing in Texas, which was signed in the third quarter of 2013. This is currently our only e-filing arrangement that was included in bookings and backlog at signing as it is our only fixed price e-filing arrangement. Excluding backlog, but including revenues from eFile Texas, which puts the contract on a comparable basis to other e-filing arrangements, bookings for the trailing 12 months, rose 30.6%. Other than the Texas contract, bookings did not fully reflect the true long-term value of new transaction-based contracts for e-filing or online payments. Revenue from these arrangements is recorded on a per filing or per transaction basis. And even though the volumes and future revenue streams maybe very predictable, we did not include future revenues in bookings and backlog, because they are dependent on those transactions occurring. Only the current quarter revenues from those arrangements are included in bookings as they are recorded. Therefore, current bookings and backlog do not capture the future revenue stream from those arrangements. We added three new transaction-based e-filing contracts in the third – in the first quarter. We signed 27 new contracts in the quarter that included software licenses greater than $100,000 and those contracts had an average license of $336,000 compared to 22 new contracts with an average license value of $451,000 in the first quarter of 2014. Our total headcount grew by 78 to 2,934 employees at the end of the first quarter compared to 2,856 at the end of the fourth quarter. Based on our first quarter performance and our outlook for the balance of the year, we have raised our earnings guidance for 2015 from our initial guidance in February. We currently expect 2015 revenues will be between $568 million and $575 million. We expect 2015 diluted GAAP EPS will be approximately $1.93 to $2.01. We expect this – that 2015 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be approximately $2.46 to $2.54. For the year, estimated non-cash share-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $19.5 million to $20 million. Fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between 36 million and 37 million shares. We estimate an annual effective tax rate for 2015 between 37.5% and 38.5%. The tax rate and share count each are affected by the timing and volume of stock option exercises throughout the year. We expect our total capital expenditures will be approximately $13.5 million to $14.5 million for the year. Total depreciation and amortization is expected to be between approximately $15.5 million and $16.5 million, including approximately $6.5 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Now, I would like to turn the call back over to John for his further comments.
John Marr: Thanks, Brian. Market conditions in the first quarter generally continued the trends we saw throughout 2014 and activity in local government marketplace is normal. Our bookings and revenue growth are clearly well in excess of market rates as we continue to gain market share and expand our market leadership. Our competitive position remains very strong across all our major product suites and win rates are high, reflecting both our long-term commitment to product development and our consistently high level of execution on our engagements. We are especially pleased with the level of growth in software license revenues even while expanding our SaaS client base. We signed record high dollar volume of new SaaS contracts in Q4 and followed that in the first quarter with another strong quarter of SaaS bookings, more than tripled the level over a year ago. While we expect that over time the percentage of new clients choosing a SaaS offering will expand, the mix of on-premise SaaS business varies from quarter-to-quarter. Last quarter, we announced that we would not be extending our current R&D arrangement for the Microsoft Dynamics AX product. While this marks the end of the initial development arrangement with Microsoft, we have been working closely with their leadership team to create a relationship that better reflects the value Tyler brings to this product. While details are still being finalized, we continue to expect a reduced R&D role with a stronger emphasis on the go to market side, assisting partners and leveraging our experience with sales and service channels in the public sector. As this quarter results show, sales for Dynamics are trending in the right direction and we expect this to continue. Finally, we are looking forward to hosting some 2,800 Tyler clients at Connect 2015, our annual user conference being held May 3 through May 6 in Atlanta. At the conference, we will also host investors and analysts at a session on Monday, May 4, from 10:00 AM to 12:30 PM Eastern Time. If you are interested in attending this session, please contact Brian Miller for more information. A live and archived webcast of the investor session will also be available at the Investor Relations section of our website. Now, Jamie, we will take questions.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Alex Zukin from Stephens. Please go ahead with your question.
Alex Zukin: Hey guys, congratulations on a very strong quarter. I wanted – my first question is just on what you saw in the 1Q period versus prior 1Qs, it looked like the sequential performance is one of the strongest you have ever posted and I am just wondering, did anything feel different this first quarter than maybe the first quarter of last year?
John Marr: No, I think over time, we have been ironing out the lumpiness from quarter-to-quarter, it’s reflected in higher SaaS revenues and maintenance revenues that obviously are very stable, but it was a strong quarter as you know from a license standpoint, good activity there and well in excess as well as the highest in any quarter, but well in excess of typical first quarters.
Alex Zukin: Much appreciated. And then, can you guys remind us a little bit for 2Q last year, the impact on either backlog or bookings from the California contract and how we should think about that going forward?
John Marr: Last year in Q2, we had I believe it was $64 million of new contract bookings from California contracts, most of that is still in backlog. Those are recognized over – they are all percentage of completion contracts or SaaS deals. They are recognized over multiple quarters and then in some cases multiple years. In the case of L.A., potentially out as long as 5 years. So the Q2 bookings number will obviously be a number that we are not likely to exceed, but it – being most of those revenues have not been recognized and will be done so over a long period of time.
Alex Zukin: Got it. That’s helpful. And then just the last one for me, you guys mentioned an MCAD replacement on the call and I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how the pipeline for MCAD replacements looks for the other two projects?
John Marr: Well, there has been some activity. There has been few replacements. There are – I think it’s still uncertain. There are some counties that continue to try to support the application on their own. There actually are some associations or groups of customers that are trying to salvage their investment and have picked up the MCAD employees and the like, but there continue to be a steady trickle of those that are choosing or deciding that, that’s just not viable. So, it’s not a mad rush. Again, the product doesn’t stop working the day the company exited the marketplace, but I think the trend is that over time more and more of these clients are realizing what they have is not sustainable and we will see more and more of those clients enter the marketplace.
Alex Zukin: Got it. And then Brian just on cash flow, any other volatility we should think about for 2Q, in general, if you look at the balance of the year, do you expect to roughly hold the same kind of cash flow margin as a percentage of revenue as you saw last year or do you expect them to increase?
Brian Miller: I think the margin will probably be similar. There are a couple – we have talked about a couple of these things that caused this year’s first quarter to be below last year’s first quarter, mostly timing things, but we did have a couple of unusual things last year. In Q1, we had some – about $7 million of milestone billings that related to progress made on certain Courts & Justice contracts. Those weren’t present in this year’s first quarter, but we have those that occur at various times throughout the year, they just – the quarters that they fell in didn’t match up with last year. The biggest thing I think is as you get into Q3, it’s typically clearly our largest quarter for cash flow. We collected significant amount of maintenance revenues, but we did have some unusually high collections in Q3 last year related to some of the California contracts in courts, where not only did they have provisions that accelerate some of those signings into Q2, but that also translated into some of the billings. So, we collected quite a bit of license revenue or license billings in Q3 of last year that won’t be replaced this year just like the bookings won’t. But in general, the trend should be similar to last year.
Alex Zukin: Got it. Thanks, guys.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Please go ahead with your question.
Jonathan Ho: Sure. Yes, congratulations on the strong quarter. Just wanted to get a sense, first of all, around the SaaS elections, it seems like there maybe some larger deals that came in on that tides. Are you seeing that general trend in the pipeline? And maybe can you give us some more color in terms of why – it looked like the overall number of elections was maybe down a little bit, but on a percentage basis – but why the dollar amounts are so much higher?
John Marr: Well, some of the – if you look at backlog, sometimes they are higher, because we are seeing a trend toward I believe is more and more of these clients want good visibility on what their long-term costs are. So, we mentioned a 7-year deal in our prepared remarks and there are a lot of those 7-year, I think there is a couple of 10-year type deals. Five seems to be kind of the minimum now. So, the term generally is longer. We don’t care too much about the term. It’s usually a customer selection since we have virtually no attrition. So, it’s not an important factor in ours. I think the word we continue to use is a gradual shift. It is not a real fast trend in anyway, but a gradual shift, it’s lumpy so you have to look over a period of time, but it continues to tick up over time. I think our strategy of continuing to not deemphasize on premise or traditional deals is important. It’s our objective to get the customer on board. And either way, we don’t have a lot of bias in terms of the cost or the way we offer these systems. We really feel the long-term value of the client is significant either way, and let the market determine that. So I think it’s an important part of our strategy that we have competitive both traditional on-premise solutions as well as cloud-based SaaS solutions.
Jonathan Ho: Got it. And then you guys mentioned briefly that there is potentially a greater sales and marketing role with Microsoft, can you talk about maybe some scenarios that could play out and maybe where you see an opportunity to add more value or provide more assistance?
John Marr: As I said, we are continuing to have discussions with their leadership team. Our engagement with them is the same even though there was a decision to not continue the R&D arrangement the way it exists. That doesn’t take effect till late this year, coincidental with the next release, which isn’t determined specifically yet. So there hasn’t been any change at this point and we are working with them closely to really define the relationship we ought to have and how our resources ought to be best utilized and deployed. And I think the consensus among the two parties, even though we continue to work on the details is that we played a significant role in the development of the initial product and bringing our expertise there and that’s where it was most important. Now that, that's reflected in the product, it could probably makes sense for us to play a significantly reduced R&D role and to have their central core development team manage that code. And yet I think what we both also recognize is that Tyler’s experience in the public sector marketplace from a sales standpoint and from a service standpoint is significant. And we are really transitioning into a phase of the relationship where that’s where it would really bring significant value. So I think, whatever results will be, as we announced last quarter, a reduced headcount in R&D, reduced spend there, but maybe some additional resources on the sales and service side, not necessarily exclusively directly, but hopefully to help bring their partner channel up to speed and to drive greater volumes. The product is well received and these partners having success early on and committing additional resources is very important both domestically and internationally. So I think that’s where you will see Tyler’s focus going forward.
Jonathan Ho: Great, thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Kevin Liu from B. Riley & Company. Please go ahead with your question.
Kevin Liu: Hi, good morning. Just looking at the investments on the services and recurring revenue side as you guys continue to invest there, is that predominantly to support kind of the backlog you have in services or are there investments going into the SaaS infrastructure as well. And then just a follow-on to that is when would you expect that pace of investment to start to moderate?
Brian Miller: Are you referring to headcount investments or investments both in headcount and development?
Kevin Liu: Really just trying to understand where the dollars are being spend, is it primarily on the headcount side for services or is there spend going elsewhere. And then wondering when we can get to see some margin expansion on that side of the business?
Brian Miller: Well, I think there is a little bit of both. Clearly, our headcount has been increasing. We have talked about this year there being a bit of a headwind. Ordinarily, with this kind of revenue growth, you would see more than 70 basis points of growth margin expansion. And some of that pressure on margins is a result of the headcount we have added over the last several quarters. And there is typically a – several months on-boarding period from the time we hire somebody on the development – well, not so much on the development side, but on the professional services side and at this time they become billable. And so we are still absorbing some of those. We expect that to moderate throughout the year as our headcount growth slows down second half of the year. And those heads are split between development resources and professional services on the implementation side and to some extent support and the implementations and support people are related to delivering the backlog we have as well as the things that are in the pipeline. But I think the headcount moderation should – or the headcount expansion should moderate as we get into the second half of the year. The development side, we talked about in our year end comments about some incremental investments that we are making in product development this year above kind of the level we have been at. And John may want to expand on that a bit?
John Marr: Yes, I think that’s right. There is no leverage really in our professional service business. And obviously, those revenues have increased significantly over the last year, year and a half, California driving some of that, but our general growth in new businesses. So, we have ramped that up. That should flatten over time, but to the extent professional service revenues grow, there really isn’t any leverage on that. All our other lines obviously licenses, subscriptions, maintenance are highly levered, but that would be the one that isn’t. As a reminder, some people – some software companies try to deemphasize or minimize their revenues on the professional service side. And while it doesn’t perform financially like the other lines, it’s an important part of our strategy and our ability to execute, deploy new contracts on time, on budget, satisfy clients, get them on maintenance and subscription I think is exceptional. In relation to the industry, it’s a challenging business, but in relation to the industry, it’s exceptional. And I think that’s because we control virtually all elements of those engagements when a lot of companies partner with integrators and I think have challenges that we simply don’t have. So, that’s a choice we make. And while it’s not favorable from a economic standpoint, it’s very favorable in terms of the overall performance of the company. As Brian indicated, obviously, we have significant resources financially at this point. We continue to look at our own stock, which is richer than it’s been historically. We continue to look at assets in the marketplace, where valuations are relatively high as well. And it could be that one of the best places for us to invest is in our products and expanding our products in terms of their footprints. And so at this point, it’s hard to know exactly where R&D goes. But again, investments in our own products and some of the recently acquired products are attractive and we believe we are uniquely positioned to make those kinds of investments, whereas PE firms and financial buyers can buy the assets that are out there. So, we do have a unique ability to invest in successful products, continue to expand our leadership position and ensure that we continue the momentum we have. So, those will be things we will be considering as we move forward.
Kevin Liu: Great. And if I could just slip in one more, on the Courts & Justice side, you mentioned the extended agreement with the County of San Mateo. Are you seeing kind of a broader opportunity amongst a lot of the California court systems that you have signed up in terms of being able to go back and up-sell or cross-sell other solutions at present?
John Marr: Yes, definitely. And that’s – I think it’s something we have discussed in the past. As Brian indicated, we don’t expect to repeat the Q2 bookings that we had last year. If you remember, they had a budgetary deadline kind of to get those resources, those budgets deployed. And so we had a big second quarter in 2014 and we don’t see that repeating, but many of those counties purchased 1 or 2 or 3 case types and they all have many case types and it’s certainly our strategy. And I think it’s their expectation as well that if we continue to be successful with those engagements that we will continue to resell into those environments, additional case types as well as sell and implement the e-file side of the business as well. So, big start last year for California, very pleased with winning all the three counties, but definitely a lot of opportunity remains in that marketplace.
Brian Miller: I will take the opportunity because clients as well, Kevin, to sell additional products in our Courts & Justice suite and we have talked about that as well. So, the opportunity to sell jails, prosecutor, probation, other products that are integrated with the court solutions is an opportunity that we are – we expect to see progress in and be able to report success there as we move through this year.
Kevin Liu: Alright, thanks and congrats on a great quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Marr, I will turn the call back over to you for any closing remarks.
John Marr: Okay. Thank you, Jamie and thank you all for joining us on the call today. If there are any further questions, feel free to reach out to me or Brian Miller. Have a great day. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today’s conference call. We do thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your telephone lines.

Operator: Hello, and welcome to today's Tyler Technologies Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2014 Conference Call. Your host for today's call is John Marr, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, February 5, 2015. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Marr. Please go ahead.
John S. Marr: Thank you, Kate, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. With me on the call today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like for Brian to give the safe harbor statement. Next, I'll have some preliminary comments. Brian will review the details of our fourth quarter operating results and 2015 guidance, then I'll have some final comments, and we'll take your questions. Brian?
Brian K. Miller: Thanks, John.

Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We'd refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless we specify otherwise. John?
John S. Marr: Thanks, Brian. We finished an exceptional year in 2014, with fourth quarter financial performance that continued a trend of very strong growth in revenues and earnings. From a historical perspective, this was our 13th quarter of double-digit revenue growth and the best fourth quarter in the company's history by virtually any financial measure. Our recurring revenues from subscriptions continues to be our fastest-growing revenue line. Our subscription revenue grew 23% and reflects strong growth of our e-filing revenues from courts as well as a continued gradual shift with the cloud-based Software as a Service business. Software license and royalty revenues were up 10% over last year. This was our seventh consecutive quarter of software license and royalty revenue over $10 million. We had another very solid quarter for bookings, which were up 28%. On a trailing 12-month basis, bookings increased 9%. However, bookings were up 27% with the Texas e-file contract considered on a comparable basis to other transaction-based e-filing arrangements. This was a robust quarter for SaaS bookings, with a total contract value of approximately $31 million in SaaS agreements signed. Some of the notable contracts signed in the fourth quarter included a 7-year multi-suite SaaS agreement with the city of Mobile, Alabama valued at approximately $11 million. This is the largest SaaS deal in the company's history in terms of total contract value. Mobile selected our Munis ERP, Incode Municipal Court, EnerGov planning, regulatory and licensing and Tyler Public Safety solutions. Mobile is the second largest city in Alabama. We also signed a contract valued at approximately $8 million with Marin County, California for Munis ERP solution. Following an extremely thorough evaluation, Marin chose Tyler to replace more than 250 ancillary systems county-wide, including a financial system from a Tier 1 ERP vendor, to enhance reporting capabilities and information delivered to employees, elected officials and residents. Other significant agreements for the Munis ERP solution, each of which were valued at greater than $1 million, included the cities of Miami Beach, Florida and Buckeye, Arizona, each of which also purchased our EnerGov solution; Cumberland County, North Carolina and Tioga County, New York. In addition to Mobile, Alabama's major SaaS agreement for Munis included the Fayette County Board of Education in Georgia; Allegany County, Maryland; and the village of Woodridge, Illinois. Our EnerGov planning regulatory licensing solution continued to win new business at a high rate, with major contracts in the fourth quarter, including a $1.1 million contract with the City of McKinney, Texas and a SaaS deal valued at approximately $4.4 million with Wake County, North Carolina, which is home of Raleigh. In our Courts & Justice Division, we signed new contracts for our Odyssey case management solutions with Harris County, Texas civil and probate courts. This deal was valued at $3.5 million and follows a third quarter contract with the Justice of Peace in Harris County. Harris County is the third largest county in the country, and includes the city of Houston. Rockwall County, Texas in the Dallas area also became a new Odyssey client. Both Harris and Rockwall counties are former MCAD clients. In Georgia, DeKalb County, the third most populous county in the state, and Chatham County, the state's fifth most populous county, signed new Odyssey contracts valued at more than $3 million each. DeKalb County is in the Atlanta area and Chatham County includes Savannah. The Columbus Consolidated Government in Muscogee County, Georgia signed an agreement for our iasWorld appraisal and tax solution valued at approximately $4.3 million and also is contracting for appraisal services. Gwinnett County, Georgia signed an appraisal service contract valued at nearly $5 million. Also, Tulsa County, Oklahoma signed a SaaS agreement for our Eagle Recorder solution valued at approximately $1.2 million. For Microsoft Dynamics AX, we signed contracts with the city of Kingston, Ontario; Albemarle County Services Authority based in Charlottesville, Virginia; and Emergence Health Network in Texas. Now I'd like for Brian to provide more details on the results of the quarter and give our annual guidance for 2015.
Brian K. Miller: Thanks, John. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2014. These results are considered unaudited until our Form 10-K is filed, which is expected to be on February 18. I'm going to provide additional data on the quarter's performance and review our guidance for 2015, then we'll move on to John's comments on the current quarter and our outlook for 2015. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. Our non-GAAP earnings exclude share-based compensation expense, the employer portion of payroll taxes on employee stock transactions and amortization of acquired intangibles. The reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. Revenues for the fourth quarter were $127.4 million, up 15.1%, with 14.5% organic growth. Software license and royalty revenues increased 9.6% and were the second highest in the company's history, just behind Q3 of 2014. The license revenue growth is particularly notable given the record high level of SaaS contract bookings in the quarter. In Q4, we received $881,000 of royalties on public sector sales of Microsoft Dynamics AX by other Microsoft bars [ph], up from $473,000 a year ago. In addition, we had approximately $1.2 million of revenues related to Tyler's direct sales of Dynamics, which are included across our various revenue lines. These direct Dynamics revenues increased 8.2% from $1.1 million in Q4 of 2013. Subscriptions continue to be our fastest-growing revenue line, and increased 22.8%. We added 24 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 12 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $31 million in total contract value compared to 26 new arrangements and 15 conversions in the fourth quarter of 2013, representing approximately $12.5 million of total contract value. New SaaS clients represented approximately 17% of our new software clients in the quarter compared to 26% of our new clients selecting SaaS solutions in the prior-year quarter. However, the average new SaaS contract value in Q4 2014 was almost 3x as large as the average in Q4 of 2013. So the SaaS contracts comprised 39% of the total new software contract value. With our subscription line, the fast -- within our subscriptions line, the fastest-growing revenue stream is from e-filing for courts and online payments. These revenues increased to $8.8 million from $6.7 million last year. Total e-filing revenue of $6.7 million this quarter grew 34% over last year, with 96% of that increase related to our Texas e-filing contract, which contributed $4.8 million of revenues this quarter. Our blended gross margin for the quarter declined 20 basis points to 47.5%, mainly due to the increase in professional services headcount over the last 3 quarters, many of whom were not yet fully billable. The high level of SaaS contracts in the new business mix this quarter also contributed to the margin reduction, as did a higher percentage of software services in this quarter's revenue mix. Our non-GAAP gross margin also declined by 20 basis points to 48.3%. SG&A expense increased 7.8% in the quarter and was 22.1% of total revenues, a decrease of 150 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. Excluding noncash share-based compensation expense, SG&A expense increased only 5.9%. Operating income was $24.6 million, an increase of 26.4%. Non-GAAP operating income was $30.5 million, up 23.7%. The non-GAAP operating margin improved 160 basis points to 23.9%, as we obtained substantial leverage from both SG&A and R&D expenses. Net income rose 45.7% to $15.3 million or $0.43 per diluted share. The fully diluted share count increased by approximately 313,000 shares as a result of stock option exercises offset somewhat by stock repurchases in the current year. Our effective tax rate was 38.1%. Free cash flow was $27 million compared to $793,000 in last year's fourth quarter. Excluding real estate CapEx, our free cash flow was $27 million versus $5.9 million. Days sales outstanding and accounts receivable were 80 days at December 31, 2014 compared to 87 days at December 30, 2013. DSOs increased sequentially from 78 days at September 30, which is our normal seasonal trend related to the timing of maintenance billings. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $702 million, up 27.2% from last year's Q4. Software-related backlog, which excludes backlog from appraisal services contracts, was $657.3 million, a 23.6% increase. Backlog included $157.8 million of maintenance compared to $136.7 million a year ago. Subscription backlog was $205.5 million compared to $188.7 million last year, and included approximately $51 million related to the Texas e-filing contract. Our bookings for the quarter, which are calculated from the change in backlog plus revenues, were $155 million, up 27.7% from last year's fourth quarter. Obviously, bookings can be somewhat lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, especially with respect to large contracts, for which revenues are often recognized over several quarters or even years. We believe that looking at bookings on a trailing 12-month basis can be meaningful and somewhat smoothing out the quarterly lumpiness. For the 12 months ended December 31, bookings rose 9.4% over the prior 12-month period. These bookings include the contract for the statewide e-filing in Texas, which was signed in the third quarter of 2013. This is currently our only e-filing arrangement that was included in bookings and backlog at signing, as it is our only fixed price e-filing arrangement. Excluding backlog, but including revenues from e-file Texas, which puts the contract on a comparable basis to other e-filing arrangements, bookings for the trailing 12 months rose 27.2%. As a reminder, bookings do not fully reflect the long-term value of new transaction-based contracts for e-filing or online payments. Revenue from these arrangements is recorded on a per filing or per-transaction basis. And even though the volumes and future revenue streams may be very predictable, we do not include future revenues in bookings and backlog because they are dependent on those transactions occurring. Only the current quarter revenues from those arrangements are included in bookings as they are recorded. Therefore, current bookings and backlog do not capture the future revenue stream from those arrangements. We signed 35 new contracts in the fourth quarter that included software licenses greater than $100,000. And those contracts had an average license value of $469,000 compared to 34 new contracts with an average license value of $531,000 in the fourth quarter of 2013. Our total headcount grew by 60 to 2,856 employees at the end of the fourth quarter compared to 2,796 at the end of the third quarter. For the full year, we added 283 employees. Turning to 2015, our initial annual guidance is as follows. We currently expect 2015 revenues will be between $567 million and $575 million. We expect 2015 diluted GAAP EPS will be approximately $1.91 to $1.99. We expect 2015 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be approximately $2.44 to $2.52. For the year, estimated noncash share-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $19.5 million to $20 million. Fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between 36 million and 37 million shares. We estimate an effective tax rate for 2015 between 37.5% and 38.5%. The tax rate and share count each are affected by the timing and volume of stock option exercises. We expect our total capital expenditures will be approximately $13.5 million to $14.5 million for the year. Total depreciation and amortization is expected to be between approximately $15.5 million and $16.5 million, including approximately $6.5 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Now I'd like to turn the call back to John for his further comments.
John S. Marr: Thank you, Brian. As I indicated earlier, we are very pleased with Tyler's strong finish to 2014. And as our initial guidance indicates, we are looking forward to another successful year in 2015. Market conditions in the fourth quarter generally continued the trends we saw throughout 2014. Activity in the local government market is good and has returned to normal prerecession levels. Our competitive position remains very strong across all our major product suites. And our win rates remain very high, which is enabling us to gain market share and expand our market leadership position. In the California courts market, most of you are aware of our competitive wins over the last 2 years. We've been selected in 25 of the 28 decisions by California courts for the new case management systems. We are now actively engaged in those implementations, and we're pleased to report the courts in 3 California counties are now live on Odyssey. We continue to pursue a number of significant long-term opportunities in California as well as other states. Those include expanding our relationships beyond case management to include our Odyssey-integrated justice solution, adding applications for jails, prosecutor, public defender and probation. We also look to continue to add new e-filing arrangements with existing courts and software clients as well as new clients. These growth opportunities are not unique to California, and all are part of our long-term growth strategy for Courts & Justice business nationwide. Texas and Georgia were both active states for new Odyssey business in the fourth quarter. While Courts & Justice was our fastest-growing product suite in 2014, all of our business units are performing at a very high level. We're especially encouraged that we've been able to grow license revenues over the last year, while expanding our SaaS client business. We had a very high dollar volume of new SaaS contracts in Q4. And while we expect that over time the percentage of new clients choosing a SaaS offering will expand, the mix of on-premise and SaaS business varies from quarter to quarter. As we announced Tuesday, subsequent to the end of the quarter, on January 30, we entered into a strategic sales and marketing alliance with Record Holdings, a privately held Australian company specializing in digitizing the spoken word in court and legal settings. As part of the alliance, we made a $15 million investment in Record Holdings, and now hold a 20% interest in the company in the form of convertible preferred stock. The investment will help Record Holdings expand more rapidly in the U.S. In Australia, Record Holdings is the leading provider of court transcript services through its Auscript subsidiary. We plan to leverage Record Holdings' enterprise and relationships, particularly in Australia and the British Commonwealth, as we make Odyssey available to courts internationally. Through its U.S. subsidiary, For The Record, the company markets FALCON, a complete digital evidence recording platform for court administrators, clerks and support staff. FTR's products are a natural extension of the solution that Odyssey provides to courts. Our sales and marketing teams will collaborate to help FTR accelerate expansion in North America. By partnering with FTR and building integration between our products, we will help our clients operate more efficiently. Tyler and Record Holdings will also share in certain revenues in the future. As noted in our press release, Tyler also announced today that its contractual R&D commitment to develop public sector functionality, the Microsoft Dynamics AX, expires with the release of Dynamics AX 7. Tyler does not anticipate continuing its R&D commitment, although it will continue to provide sustained engineering and technical support for the public sector functionality within Dynamics AX. Tyler further expects that licenses and maintenance royals for all the applicable domestic and international sales of Dynamics AX for the public sector entities will continue under the terms of the agreement. Brian detailed our initial guidance for 2015 earlier in the call. Tyler's results in 2014 exceeded our original plan by a wide margin, and we're confident in our ability to build on that success in the coming year. Although we expect to see some pressure on margin expansion in 2015, as we absorb onboarding cost associated with staffing in recent quarters, make some strategic incremental product investments and continue to grow our SaaS and e-filing client businesses, our expectations clearly are that 2015 will be another year of very solid revenue and earnings growth for Tyler. Now Kate, we'll take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Jonathan Ho of William Blair & Company.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: I just wanted to start out with sort of the Microsoft arrangement and what you guys think in terms of the ongoing spend that's still going to be there, even if you're not supporting sort of the full development effort at this point.
John S. Marr: Well, again, the contract naturally -- the R&D contract naturally expires at the end of the release of the next version, which hasn't been publicly announced, but is probably sometime very late in this year. So the R&D spend and the commitments to customers and sales channels and really everything that we currently have in our Dynamics practice really won't be changing much in the current year. Subsequent to that, as that release goes out, a significant number of people that are involved in the R&D of Dynamics will be redeployed more than in -- on other proprietary projects, and our activity on that side will be somewhat different. So our spend this year will be very much at the current run rates, and it will decline significantly next year.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Got it. And then it seems like you guys saw some uptick in terms -- or changes in the dynamics around your SaaS business towards larger deals. I'm just trying to understand sort of what you're seeing out in the field. Are you starting to see maybe a shift towards customers being willing to adopt in a different segment of the market in terms of the SaaS deals? Can you maybe give us some thoughts in terms of how that trend is progressing, and whether you think more customers will elect SaaS over time?
John S. Marr: Well, as we've said in the remarks, that's going to vary quarter to quarter, whether we're talking about Dynamics or our proprietary business. And I think we've been around this 30% or 1/3 of deals in value for some time, and I think that's probably still a reasonable assumption. Certainly, the sampling for Dynamics is far too small to draw any conclusion based on the mix in a given quarter or 2.
Operator: And the next question comes from Scott Berg of Northland.
Scott R. Berg - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division: A couple of questions. John, first, just to expand on the Dynamics relationship. With the ending of the contractual R&D relationship, does that mean all the functionality is essentially built in at this point and nothing new will be needed in future releases after Dynamics 7? We're just trying to understand what your long-term responsibilities will be for that product, especially if you will be gaining royalties on the future products after 7.
John S. Marr: Yes, that's a fair question, a little of both. Certainly, the initial features, functions for the public sector that were targeted to be added and that our role represented are largely achieved. I certainly would say that if things were far more robust and the business were performing at a different level, then there'd be a greater likelihood that we'd continue the level of spend we've had. And we'd continue to add more and more functionality. There are always things, obviously, you can add. The market and the competitive landscape are always changing. So I think the initial objectives have been satisfied, and the decision is to not continue to invest at that level. Always been contemplated. What does that mean once our role has been satisfied from an R&D perspective? And while we've never disclosed the specific terms of the arrangement, it certainly was always understood that nothing is forever, and there was a very long runoff where we'll be compensated for royalties in the product based on the investment that we've already made. In broad terms, the current rates or percentages of our royalty for licenses and maintenance will continue at their current level or about 10 years. And then for another 9 years, they'll continue on a declining basis. So we will continue to share in those royalties for the product we've helped build for a very long time.
Scott R. Berg - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division: Great. And then, John, could you expand a little bit on the investment in Record Holdings and how that expands your opportunity? Obviously, it takes the Odyssey case management system into different countries. But how do you view the TAM, the overall sales opportunity, the deal sizes there and just trying to better understand what that can mean to you. Obviously, it's going to take some time, but on a longer-term basis?
John S. Marr: Sure, well, the first thing to say is we did end up making a financial investment that we think will be very helpful to the company. It's a smaller private company, and I think they can use that to much more quickly get to market and get a leadership position in a changing marketplace. It isn't where it started. It started as a natural partnership where, obviously, we have a very strong position here in America. For Courts & Justice, they have a very strong position in Australia and, to some degree, in other parts of the world. They do something that's completely complementary to what we do and not at all competitive to what we do. So their ability to introduce us to clients in the marketplace in Australia and, to some degree, in other parts of Europe and some other places in the world is interesting to us. They've got the same kind of relationships that we enjoy here. And they've got an exciting offering that they're investing in here in the States that I think can be hastened along significantly by our relationships and by the capital investment we made. More specifically, in terms of the TAM, I understand Australia to be similar in size to Texas. So while we all know it's a very big country geographically, it's roughly that size of an opportunity. And as we saw, when California went from really not an addressable market, given their own build, to becoming available to us... It's hard to find new Texases and new Californias, so that's intriguing to us. It's obviously a similar type of government and court system to the States, obviously English-speaking. So we think that's a significant opportunity for us.
Scott R. Berg - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division: Okay, great. And then the last question for me, at least, Brian, on the licenses for the current California Courts & Justice deals. I know the level of customization there, at least initially, was going to be a little bit more than maybe some other states, given some of the complexities there. Can you kind of characterize how the runoff of those license deals are kind of expected to hit the P&L over the next maybe 4 to 8 quarters in terms of is there anything different, substantially different in that timeline relative to other Courts & Justice deals or your PDLs?
Brian K. Miller: Not particularly other -- for similar-size kinds of deals. We're -- as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're actively engaged in virtually all of those implementations at this point. We recognized in 2014, total license revenues were in -- for our California contracts were just under $2 million. And as we move into '15, that recognition will accelerate. Virtually all of our licenses in the Courts & Justice business are going to come out of backlog on a percentage of completion basis. Some of those play out over as long as 5 years in the case of Los Angeles. So we'll certainly recognize more than that in licenses in '15, and it will probably stay at a similar level in '16. And we do anticipate adding additional California clients along the way as well as adding additional case types to some of the existing clients. But I think the key is we've recognized really very little of the licenses in California to date. Total licenses for all the California agreements are a little under $30 million. So there's still quite a bit there to come in the next couple of years. And that's part of the reason we have confidence in being able to grow licenses at a continued nice rate next year, even with a high level of SaaS business.
Operator: The next question comes from Brian Kinstlinger of Maxim Group.
Brian Kinstlinger - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division: I'm wondering if the seasonality in your business, which has decreased over the last decade, maybe how we should think about it in 2015?
Brian K. Miller: Our seasonality as we've gotten bigger and as more and more of our revenues come from recurring revenue sources, has smoothed out a bit. I think as -- and I think that will -- that trend will really continue. I think some of it inherently, some of the licenses and nonrecurring revenue sources can be somewhat lumpy. But I think when we look at 2016 -- 2015, we probably, again, expect to see that seasonality from -- both from a revenues and an earnings standpoint smooth out. Typically, the first quarter revenues are at the lowest level, and then they expand throughout the year. But I think as we look at '15, the last 3 quarters of the year, revenues are fairly consistent from quarter to quarter, and earnings would not fluctuate as much from quarter to quarter, as we may have seen in some of the prior years. And to some extent, that was the pattern we saw in '14 as well.
Brian Kinstlinger - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division: Great. And then 2014 was a fantastic year for RFP activity and certainly your win rates. As you enter 2015, how would you characterize the procurement environment and pipeline of RFPs that you see? Is it similar to '14? Is it stronger than '14? Is it maybe not as robust?
John S. Marr: Probably somewhat similar, with the exception of California. Obviously, we ended up being about $20 million above revenues than what was in the initial guidance, which is unusual for us. We're usually pretty close on the revenues, and about half of that came from California. Two things, that market we knew became an opportunity with a change in the project they were managing themselves, but to see 29 counties make decisions that quickly is unusual in our space. So a lot of that rolled forward. And obviously, there isn't going to be that kind of a dynamic in the market to place this year. The second thing that happened is there were budgetary pressures where they actually had to get underway and spend some of that money. So ordinarily, you might see those in bookings and backlog, but not realize much in the way of revenues in the current year when an opportunity presents itself. So I would call that somewhat of an anomaly. C&J's, our Courts & Justice Division's pipeline is strong. There's a lot of other opportunity in the country, but clearly, that was a little bit of an outsized deal that happened very quickly in 2014. And I would say that would be the exception. Otherwise, I think everything else should perform relatively steady and on the trend that it's been on.
Brian Kinstlinger - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division: Great. The last question I have, have you identified -- have you been able to identify the market value of MCAD's court business? And what of that is addressable to you and maybe how much you've been awarded, details like that? And is everyone expecting to switch if their product's not supported anymore? Just some details around that, please.
John S. Marr: I don't think we've put a number on it. I think there are some early defections, and I think that's meaningful not just for those deals. Certainly, Harris County is a very large county. But I think if enough significant clients move away from that, its ability to sustain itself for the remaining clients will be impacted. So I think -- you just don't know what's going to happen. This doesn't happen very often, that somebody just wholesale-ly exits the marketplace. Generally, there's a very long process. We all know it's hard to kill a software company, as they say. So normally, it was a very long process to -- someone leaving, say, the competitive new business environment and becoming a legacy vendor. And often, it's 8, 10, 12 years before their customers really start defecting in numbers. But this is certainly different. There isn't a company there to support it on a sustainable basis. If there were enough clients, then maybe there'd be some kind of an ecosystem developed around it, and that doesn't appear to be happening. So we had expected that's a fertile market for us in the next few years.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Zukin with Stephens.
Aleksandr J. Zukin - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Picking up the theme, kind of the last question. If you look at your pipelines looking at 2015 and even 2016, can you just step back for a second and give us a sense of what gives you the continued confidence that kind of the end market demand is there, it's strong, and it's in this multiyear ups -- continues to be this multiyear upcycle?
John S. Marr: Well, I mean, obviously, we've got all kinds of different leading indicators to it, and whether it's RFPs and demos and the rates they're moving. If you remember, in 2009, '10, '11, there was a big pipeline, but people weren't making decisions on time. They weren't operating in a normal schedule of these processes, and things continued to get delayed and on and on. And that isn't our experience now. A reasonable number of new opportunities continue to enter the marketplace. The processes are moving along in an orderly typical fashion, what we saw before the 2008 to 2011 or '12 cycle that was slow. And so it just seems to us from, again everything from RFPs to demo schedules to awards that the pipeline, people come out of it, people go in it. And the processes, most importantly, because really, if you remember specifically in those years, it wasn't that there weren't deals out there. People weren't making decisions. And when they were, they were scrutinized much further in meetings. Additional meetings and processes were added to the situation, and that's not our experience now. So it's not a tremendously robust market. As we've said, it's more typical and normal. And the biggest change in our growth in the new business market clearly is attributable to the improvement in our competitive position. So as long as we have a healthy market, invest as we have been -- and this year, we mentioned in the remarks, there are a lot of incremental investments in this year to support that and not take for granted, that we're going to continue to benefit from the market share that we've enjoyed in the last year or 2.
Aleksandr J. Zukin - Stephens Inc., Research Division: That's helpful. And then just another question on the incremental justice software systems that you're putting in behind -- into the Odyssey customers. What is the typical incremental uptick that you see from those deals or from those customers versus the initial deal?
John S. Marr: Yes. Well, obviously, it depends a little bit on what we sold them initially. But what you're seeing, and we had some of it in the remarks, is, very often, there's an opportunity that's a multiple of the original agreement, especially in these very large counties. And the reason is twofold. Sometimes, those initial engagements are not all for -- are not for all the case types. So in the case of Harris County, we go in for a certain case type and, then a quarter later, it's expanded to include additional couple of case types. So it can expand significantly because you went in for criminal and then you add civil. And the second way is you only sold them case management initially maybe and then you expand it to include probation and jail and prosecutor and all these other types of applications as well. So in a lot of cases, we're happy to get our foot in the door. It could be a single case type, it could be a single application. And when that's the case, the incremental value going forward could be -- would be a multiple of the original engagement. If the original engagement included all case types and the full suite of applications, then obviously, it'd be significantly less.
Operator: The next question comes from Matt Williams of Evercore ISI.
Matthew L. Williams - Evercore ISI, Research Division: Maybe just 2 for me, but I guess, first, you talked about some of the incremental kind of hiring this year on the services side, and I know there's been a fair amount of investment on the e-filing side as well. Could you talk a little bit about how you expect to sort of leverage some of that services, capacity and maybe some of the other investments around e-filing as the Texas deal sort of matures a little bit and some of the implementations start to accelerate with some of the services capacity?
John S. Marr: Sure. We are absorbing -- I mean, this plan -- last year, as you know, we had nearly 300 basis points in operating margin expansion, which is significant. We had a high-growth rate, and that helps your ability to do that. After a year like that, in our view, we certainly would like to grow margins. There's a little margin expansion in the plan. It's not unusual that our margins do a little better than planned in the year. So that would be great. But in our view, this is a year where we obviously need to grow the organization to perform the higher level of business that we have on our plate. So there were a lot of people that have actually already been hired, but are still in the onboarding process. So we're training them. They're parallel in other people, and they're not yet financially productive. So we're carrying that now and will-- in the year. And we'll continue to add people in that area as we go forward. I mentioned earlier, we are clearly, as we went through the plan for this year, choosing to support incremental development efforts, features, functions, broadening what the products do for our clients. And we feel it's a good investment to make to sustain the momentum that we've had in the marketplace as we go forward.
Matthew L. Williams - Evercore ISI, Research Division: Great, that's helpful. And then maybe just kind of touching on the Record Holdings investment that may be looking across the broader product portfolio, whether it's on Courts & Justice or Munis or any of the ERP or schools offerings. Are there other sort of opportunities that might make sense from a product standpoint, not necessarily from a specific company standpoint, but are there any kind of, I don't want to call them holes in the portfolio, but any opportunities from a sort of product functionality standpoint, where this type of investment as opposed to a pure acquisition might make some sense?
John S. Marr: Well, we'd probably not get too specific from a competitive standpoint, but just talk about this in general. I don't believe there are entire enterprise areas that we have no meaningful presence in at this point in time. So I don't expect us to be talking to you about a product we built or a company we bought that's an entirely different suite of application than anything we've done historically. Our objective, though, as a company, is to be -- have a leading position in all of the important enterprise areas of local government. So obviously, the way the company has been built, everything doesn't enjoy exactly the same level of leadership. There are many areas where I think we're a clear leader, with strong competitive and defensible positions. And there are other areas, quite frankly, where we do reasonably well because of Tyler's broad offering, presence, brand, et cetera. And I think EnerGov is a good example of a case where we had applications in that space. They may not have been, on their own, industry-leading, but they were functional, and served our clients well as part of a broader suite. And we stepped up and acquired a company that had a presence and had the potential to be a clear leader in that narrow niche. And that's what we've been achieving with them. There are other areas like that, where we currently may not be a very clear leader in that very specific niche, but we have a presence and it's part of our broader suite. And those are decisions we're making strategically. Do we invest further in our own organic products to grow them in that direction? Or from time to time, when something presents itself, is there an ability to acquire a product that improves those features within our customer base?
Operator: The next question comes from Kevin Liu of B. Riley & Co.
Kevin Liu - B. Riley Caris, Research Division: First question, you talked about the opportunity Record Holdings brings you in terms of opening up the Australian market for Courts & Justice, but I'd be curious as to whether you feel there are other international markets that your existing products would serve well? And then also whether there are kind of acquisition opportunities out there that could push you more so outside of the U.S.?
John S. Marr: We mentioned the U.K. in our remarks. It really would be the major English-speaking countries in the world are potential opportunities for us. It's kind of early to be specific about that. We've been -- we've had people travel to those countries, attend trade shows, talk to clients, talk to partners. And we do believe that there is a meaningful opportunity, that our product's competitive, that it's reasonably ready to be deployed in certain countries. And so that's something that we expect to pursue over the next few years. Will the revenue be significant in the next few years? Probably not, but hopefully, we'll build our presence in some of these countries that will allow us to sustain our growth as we eventually begin to saturate the U.S. marketplace.
Kevin Liu - B. Riley Caris, Research Division: Great. And then just looking at your SaaS pipeline today, obviously, in the fourth quarter, it seemed like your customers are willing to buy a number of products on a hosted basis. Are you seeing that still within the existing deals that you have? And are the durations for these deals also getting longer?
John S. Marr: Okay. Yes, I said earlier, I'd stick with this 30% or 1/3 level. Quarter to quarter, it jumps around, but if you look at our trailing 12 months, generally, that seems to be the adoption rate. I would expect that it will continue to expand over time, but it seems to be at a slow rate certainly in the government marketplace. So that would be the way I'd look at it as you kind of do your modeling. I would say yes to the second part of your question. I think we had one 10-year engagement in the fourth quarter, several 7s. So the old 3- to 5-year engagement, in some cases, seems to be morphing to often 7, occasionally even longer.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Mark Schappel of Benchmark.
Mark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division: So most of my questions have been answered. I just want to know, John, I just want to make sure I heard you correctly earlier in the call with respect to your decision to redeploy R&D resources away from Dynamics. Is your decision related to the slower-than-expected uptake rate of that particular product?
Brian K. Miller: Well, the decision not to extend the R&D side of the relationship beyond AX 7, no. Microsoft's -- that's their choice, to a large degree, and that's the decision around that. And then the question becomes, what do you do with the R&D resources? Well, the reason we were brought into this in the first place is that these are largely strong subject matter experts that bring those skill sets to that product, and they have the same value back in the proprietary Tyler place. And fortunately, this is a decision we're making well ahead of the release of that product. So the ability to redeploy those strategically into different product sets within Tyler is something that will be absorbed through the normal headcount growth that we would have seen, attrition, maybe in some cases being willing to get a little ahead of what the normal headcount growth will be because we've got experienced, talented, Tylerized kind of people rather than going out in the broader market to recruit. So it's our expectation that the majority of those people will find productive places in proprietary Tyler development environments.
Mark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division: So this was a Microsoft decision to discontinue the R&D around the product. Is that correct?
John S. Marr: Yes, yes.
Operator: It appears there are no more questions at this time. Mr. Marr, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.
John S. Marr: Okay. Well, thank you for joining us on the call today. Have a great day. And if there are any further questions, then feel free to follow up with Brian and myself. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Hello, and welcome to today’s Tyler Technologies Third Quarter 2014 Conference Call. Your host for today’s call is John Marr, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today’s conference call is being recorded today, October 23, 2014. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Marr. Please go ahead.
John S. Marr: Thank you and welcome to our third quarter 2014 earnings call. With me on the call today is I would now like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Marr. Please go ahead. With me on the call today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I’d like for Brian to give the safe-harbor statement. Next, I’ll have some preliminary comments, and Brian will review the details of our third quarter operating results and 2014 guidance. Then I’ll have some final comments, and we’ll take your questions. Brian?
Brian K. Miller: Thanks, John. During the course of this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information and may include projections concerning the company’s future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the safe-harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. John?
John S. Marr: Our third quarter financial performance continued the trend of record results in virtually every meaningful matrix. From a historical perspective, this was our 15th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth and our 12th straight quarter of double digit revenue growth. Our GAAP net income of $17 million made this our most profitable quarter ever. It was our second consecutive quarter with organic revenue growth greater than 20% and net income growth greater than 50%. Our recurring revenues from subscriptions and maintenance continued to be major drivers as together they grew 20% and represented approximately 60% of total revenues for the quarter. Our subscription revenue growth of 49% reflects strong growth in our e-filing revenues from courts as well as a continuing gradual shift toward cloud-based softwares and service business. Software license and royalty revenues achieved exceptional growth again this quarter, up 26% over last year. This was our first $13 million license quarter and our fourth consecutive quarter where licenses and royalty revenues grew year-over-year by 20% or more. Gross margin improved 170 basis points to 48%, reflecting our high level of software licenses, as well as the earnings leverage from incremental recurring revenues. During the third quarter we completed the acquisition of SoftCode, Incorporated. SoftCode, which was founded in 1991, specializes in software for managing civil process. SoftCode primarily serves county sheriff’s departments and offers a complete civil case management solution, from court to service attempts to final executions of payments. With this acquisition, we broaden our portfolio of court and justice solutions with a product that is very complementary with our Odyssey suite. SoftCode’s founding partners, management and employees have joined Tyler’s Courts and Justice Division and over the coming months their technology and service offerings will be integrated into our operations and branding. SoftCode’s annual revenues last year were in the $3 million range and we expect to see them grow meaningfully as part of Tyler. We had a tough bookings comparison for this quarter as the third quarter of last year included bookings of approximately $72 million from our Texas e-filing contract as well as two statewide Odyssey court contracts. Accordingly, total bookings were down 32% for the quarter; however, excluding bookings from eFileTexas from last year’s third quarter, bookings grew almost 5%, which we consider to be solid given the strong comp. On a trailing 12-month basis bookings are up 22% with Texas e-filing considered on a comparable basis to other e-filing arrangements. Some of the notable contracts announced in the third quarter included an agreement with the City of Detroit, Michigan for appraisal services valued at approximately $7 million. Tyler will provide the city with real property appraisal data verification, sketch conversions and valuation services for the city’s first full reappraisal in 50 years, and a project that is considered to be an important component of Detroit’s financial restructuring. The California courts market took a break from new contracts this quarter, but we continued to add new customers for our Odyssey case management solution in other states. We signed an Odyssey contact with Kane County, Illinois, valued at approximately $4.1 million. Kane County is the state’s fifth largest county and represents our second Odyssey client in Illinois. We also signed a contract valued at approximately $3.5 million with Harris County, Texas, to implement Odyssey in 16 Justice of the Peace courts. Harris County, which includes the City of Houston, is the third largest county in the United States. In addition we signed an integrated justice system contract including Odyssey courts and jails with Webb County, Texas, which includes the City of Laredo. Our EnerGov planning, permitting and licensing software where we announced contracts with the city of Charleston, South Carolina, and Los Angeles County, California. In the ERP market we signed a $4.1 million contract for our Munis solution with Jefferson County, Alabama, the home of Birmingham and the state’s largest county. We also signed Munis contracts totaling almost $3 million with the cities of Midland, Texas, and North Miami Beach, Florida, each of which also included EnerGov solutions. Significant new SaaS contracts for Munis included Altamonte Springs, Florida, a $4.3 million contract that also includes EnerGov, and Oklahoma County, the largest county in Oklahoma and the home of Oklahoma City. Our EnerGov solutions continue to gain market share. In addition to contracts that included both EnerGov and one of our ERP solutions, we signed significant EnerGov contracts with Riverside County, California, the nation’s 11th largest county and the City of Carlsbad, California. Also in the quarter we announced agreements with New Port Richey, Florida, and the cities of Allen and College Station, Texas, which included both Munis and EnerGov solutions. Finally we signed a contract for our Infinite Visions financial software with the Tucson Unified School District, the second largest school district in Arizona. Now, I’d like for Brian to provide more details on the results for the quarter and our annual guidance for 2014.
Brian K. Miller: Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2014. Since our press release and Form 10-Q are both available, I’m going to add some color around some of the key factors in the quarter and review our guidance for 2014. Then we’ll move on to John’s comments on the current quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2014. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. Our non-GAAP earnings exclude share-based compensation expense, the employer portion of payroll taxes on employee stock transactions and amortization of acquired intangibles. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. Revenues for the third quarter were $128.7 million, a new quarterly high, and up 20.2%, virtually all of which was organic. Software license and royalty revenues increased 26.0%. In Q3, we received $906,000 of royalties on public sector sales of Microsoft Dynamics AX by other Microsoft [buyers] (ph), down from $1.0 million a year ago. In addition, we had approximately $1.1 million of revenues related to Tyler’s direct sales of Dynamics, which are included across our various revenue lines. These direct Dynamics revenues increased 84% from $573,000 in Q3 of 2013. Subscriptions continue to be our fastest growing revenue line and increased 49.2%. We added 38 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 11 existing on-premise clients, representing approximately $17 million in total contract value, compared to 24 new arrangements and 14 conversions in the third quarter of 2013. Approximately 34% of our software clients in the quarter selected our cloud-based solutions. The subscriptions line also includes the fast growing revenue stream from e-filing for courts and online payments. These revenues doubled to $8.2 million from $4.0 million last year. Total e-filing revenue of $6.2 million this quarter included approximately $4.4 million related to our Texas e-filing contract, up from approximately $590,000 last year. Our blended gross margin for the quarter rose 170 basis points to 48.0%. The increase reflects the higher level of license revenues as well as margin leverage from the incremental recurring revenues, primarily those from e-filing. Gross margin expansion was somewhat suppressed in the first three quarters of 2013 as we incurred costs ahead of revenues related to the Texas e-filing contract. Our non-GAAP gross margin expanded by 160 basis points to 48.8%. SG&A expense increased 11.2% in the quarter and was 21.3% of total revenues, a decrease of 170 basis points from last year’s third quarter. Excluding non-cash share-based compensation expense, SG&A expense increased 9.6%. Operating income was $26.7 million, an increase of 49.8%. Non-GAAP operating income was $32.4 million, up 40.3%. The non-GAAP operating margin improved 350 basis points to a new high of 25.1% as we leveraged both SG&A and R&D expenses to grow operating margin at a much greater rate than gross margin. Net income rose 53.9% to $17 million, or $0.48 per diluted share. The fully diluted share count increased by approximately 520,000 shares as a result of stock option exercises, offset somewhat by stock repurchases in the current quarter. Our effective tax rate was 36.3%. Our tax rate declined from previous quarters primarily due to lower estimated state taxes based on currently anticipated revenue allocations. Free cash flow was $64.7 million compared to $35.7 million in last year’s third quarter. Excluding real estate CapEx, our free cash flow was $64.7 million versus $40.7 million. Free cash flow for the third quarter actually exceeded our cash flow for the full year 2013 and we ended the quarter with cash of $157.4 million. Days sales outstanding and accounts receivable were 78 days at September 30, 2014, compared to 76 days at September 30, 2013. DSOs decreased sequentially from 104 days at June 30, which is our normal seasonal trend related to the timing of maintenance billings. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $674.0 million, up 24.6% from last year’s Q3. Software-related backlog, which excludes backlogs from appraisal services contracts, was $634.3 million, a 22.6% increase. Backlog included $152.1 million of maintenance compared to $135.3 million a year ago. Subscription backlog was $194.7 million compared to $189.3 million last year and included approximately $56 million related to the Texas e-filing contract. Our bookings for the quarter, which are calculated from the change in backlog plus revenues, were $148 million, down 31.8% from last year’s third quarter. Q3 of last year included the Texas e-filing contract booking of approximately $72 million as well as two statewide courts contracts that totaled almost $26 million. Excluding the backlogs from the Texas e-file contract, bookings grew 4.7% in the quarter. Obviously, bookings can be somewhat lumpy from quarter to quarter, especially with respect to large contracts for which revenues are often recognized over several quarters or even years. We believe that looking at bookings on a trailing 12-month basis can be meaningful in somewhat smoothing out the quarterly lumpiness. For the 12 months ended September 30, bookings were up 4.3% over the prior 12-month period. These bookings include the contract for the statewide e-filing in Texas. This is our only e-filing arrangement that was included in bookings and backlog at signing as it is our only fixed price e-filing arrangement. Excluding the backlog but including revenues from eFileTexas, which puts the contract on a comparable basis to other e-filing arrangements, bookings for the trailing 12 months rose approximately 22.0%. As a reminder, bookings do not fully reflect the true long-term value of new transaction-based contracts for e-filing or online payments. Revenue from these arrangements is recorded on a per-filing or per-transaction basis. And even though the volumes and future revenue streams may be very predictable, we do not include future revenues in bookings and backlog because they are dependent on those transactions occurring. Only the current quarter revenues from those arrangements are included in bookings as they are reported. Therefore, current bookings and backlog do not capture the future revenue stream from those arrangements. We signed 30 new contracts in the third quarter that included software licenses greater than $100,000, and those contracts had an average license of $475,000 compared to 29 new contracts with an average license value of $674,000 in the third quarter of 2013. Our total headcount grew by 61 to 2,796 employees at the end of the third quarter compared to 2,735 at the end of the second quarter. Based on our results for the first three quarters of the year and our current outlook for the balance of the year, we have revised upward our revenue and earnings guidance for the year. Our revised 2014 annual guidance is as follows. We currently expect 2014 revenues will be between $489 million and $494 million. We expect 2014 diluted GAAP EPS will be approximately $1.63 to $1.69. We expect 2014 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be approximately $2.06 to $2.12. For the year, estimated non-cash, share-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $15.0 million. Fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between 35 million and 36 million shares. We estimate an effective tax rate for 2014 between 37% and 39%. The tax rate and share count depend somewhat on the timing and volume of stock option exercises. We expect our total capital expenditures will be approximately $10.5 million to $11 million for the year. Total depreciation and amortization is expected to be between $14.5 million and $15 million, including approximately $6.5 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Now I’d like to turn the call back over to John for his further comments on the quarter.
John S. Marr: Thanks, Brian. As I indicated earlier, we are very pleased with Tyler’s third quarter results, which by most measures, was the best quarter in our history. And as our revised guidance indicates, we have a very positive outlook for the remainder of the year. Most of the factors contributing to our success this quarter have similar themes to last year. Activity in the local government market is good and has returned to normal pre-recession levels. Most importantly, our competitive position is very strong across all of our major product suites, and our win rates remain very high, which is enabling us to gain market share and expand our leadership position. As you know, our bookings and backlog in the first half of the year benefited from our success in the California courts market, where we signed 13 contracts in the second quarter and have now been selected in 25 of the 28 decisions made by California courts. The timing of some of these contracts was accelerated into the second quarter because some counties had limits on the availability of funds. While revenues for these contracts will be recognized over a number of years or in some cases years, the growth in backlog provides us with increasing visibility over future revenues. There were no new California case management contracts awarded in the third quarter but it’s important to recognize that significant long-term opportunities remaining in that market. First we expect that over time the other 30 counties in California will acquire new case management systems. Second, our existing contracts with several courts do not currently cover the – all case types and we expect to expand those relationships to include additional case types. Third, while we have signed 17 California counties to transaction-based e-filing contracts, we expect that most if not all of the courts using Odyssey software will ultimately be using our e-filing solution as well. These revenues will not start until our case management systems are implemented but in many cases we expect that the recurring e-filing revenues will be as much as two times the annual maintenance revenues. Finally, we are pursuing opportunities to expand our relationship with California counties beyond case management systems to our Odyssey integrated justice solution, adding applications for jails, prosecutor, public defender and probation. These expansion opportunities are not unique to California and are part of our long-term growth strategy for the courts and justice business nationwide. The eFileTexas system continues to perform exceptionally well and we believe that it can serve as the model for future e-filing systems in other jurisdictions across the country. During the third quarter we added the courts in Clayton County, Georgia, as a new e-file client. While courts and justice has been our fastest growing product line in 2014, all of our business units are performing at a high level. For example, all of our major product groups had double digit revenue growth in the third quarter and each business unit exceeded its plans for revenues and operating profits. With our Microsoft Dynamics AX relationships, results this quarter were again somewhat mixed. Our royalty revenues from this quarter from sales from other buyers were down about 13% from last year. Royalties this quarter represent sales in 21 countries. We expect that royalty revenues will continue to vary from quarter-to-quarter and represent both a risk and an opportunity in our short-term results. In our direct channel for Dynamics, revenues totaled $1.1 million, a substantial increase over last year. Tyler signed three new Dynamics clients through our direct channel this quarter; the City of West Hartford, Connecticut, the Buffalo and Fort Erie Peace Bridge Authority in New York and the Ohio Police and Fire Pension Fund. Brian detailed our revised guidance for 2014 earlier in the call. The upward revision reflects our third quarter results, as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year, including opportunities and risk. Tyler’s results in 2014 have exceeded our internal plans by a wide margin. It’s a testament to the skills and dedication of the Tyler team of nearly 2,800 professionals that we’ve been able to grow revenues at a rate substantially greater than the broader market is growing and expand margins while building our SaaS client base, investing in product development at a high level and absorbing onboarding costs associated with a net increase of more 220 employees through the first nine months of the year. Thank you for joining us on the call and now we’ll take your questions.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we’ll now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question today comes from Charlie Strauzer from CJS Securities. Please go ahead with your question.
Charles Strauzer – CJS Securities, Inc.: Hi good morning. John, if you can explain a little bit more on the Microsoft product and your thoughts now that you’ve been in the marketplace for a while and the feedback you’re getting post some of the RFPs that are out there that you might not have won versus the pipeline when you look at some of the opportunities coming out. Are there some bigger opportunities that you think that might benefit sales there and also are you seeing any push factors giving you any – in the interim?
John S. Marr:  Well, it’s a little mixed as we said, Charlie. We’re pleased that we signed three contracts on a direct basis in the last quarter. We do have an active pipeline that’s growing. We’re identifying and establishing a presence in what I call sub-niches in the marketplace. We certainly are a little bit constrained by the success of Munis and our other proprietary financial products and we’re working hard to find the right places to grow our presence and gain momentum on a direct basis and that’s going pretty well and we’re encouraged by that. I think it’s gaining some momentum. When I say it’s a little mixed, we just really have very little visibility into what’s going to come through their channel. We literally learn after the quarter and I don’t think they have an awful lot of visibility. I don’t think that it’s a lack of transparency; it’s just that it’s through a channel, their partners and it’s hard to know exactly when they are going to win the deals. The thing we are encouraged by is, as I said, in more than 20 countries this quarter, consistently a very worldwide geographic footprint for the product that not just represents the countries and the partners that secure those deals but that’s I think representative of them building a very broad partner alliance group and presence in the marketplace. But certainly it’s taking probably a little longer than we expected and they expected to accelerate the numbers.
Charles Strauzer – CJS Securities, Inc.: In the meantime you’re obviously showing some very good quarter growth in all the products. Thank you very much.
John S. Marr: Yeah.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Weidemoyer from William Blair & Company. Please go ahead with your question.
Jonathan Ho – William Blair & Company LLC: Hi, this is Jonathan Ho. If we were to take a look at your California case types that you could potentially add on to existing contracts, how much larger of an opportunity do you think you could get just from the counties that you’ve won so far and what would be the approximate timing for that type of add-on activity?
John S. Marr: I don’t know that we have that quantified but it might be fair to say that the volume of those deals is maybe in the half to two-thirds range so there is still another doubling or 50% of growth opportunity by adding other case types in the deals we’ve already done. And it’s important to pursue that because while we’ve done fewer than half the counties so far in terms of awards, the deals we have won represent more than 70% of the population base. So we have won many of the larger counties and our focus will be as we said to expand the case types, hopefully pursue integrated justice systems, including other applications entirely. And post-implementation the real benefit will be achieved as the e-filing comes online.
Jonathan Ho – William Blair & Company LLC: Got it. And then can you just talk a little bit about win rates? I know you guys have seen some improvements in prior quarters but are you seeing that trend accelerate, are you seeing it stay stable in terms of higher win rates? Just relative to your expectations how the win rates have been progressing.
John S. Marr: Of course there is a lot of different product suites involved and I don’t think we can accelerate in courts and justice. We’ve won virtually all of the meaningful deals over the last few years so if you look there we’ll be happy with stable because it’s – anyway. In some of the broader applications, it accelerated – really we saw are the meaningful acceleration in the second half of last year and I would say it’s stayed within a pretty tight range since then. It was a meaningful move in the market, these are a lot of sub-market areas that we had focused on and really had tried to identify what we had to do to improve our presence in some areas where we hadn’t performed as well as others. And we’re focused on sustaining that. It’s probably not possible to achieve the level of market share in those markets that are still vertical but you see horizontal players in them. There just are price points and sizes and different position criteria that no one solution can address all the time. So I think the level we’re at is a pretty strong one and probably improvement would only be modest from there.
Jonathan Ho – William Blair & Company LLC: Great results on the quarter, thank you.
John S. Marr: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Kinstlinger from Maxim. Please go ahead with your question.
Brian Kinstlinger – Maxim Group:  Hi, good morning. As it relates to e-file I’m curious what percentage of your CMS installed base has your e-file solution and then did Clayton County, Georgia, have your CMS?
John S. Marr: I’m not certain that Clayton County is a CMS client or not. We have a significant presence in Georgia. There are several counties there that have our CMS that don’t currently do e-file and there are some that have e-filing from us that don’t have CMS. I’m not positive which one Clayton falls in. And in terms of what percent, it’s not all of them and it’s probably more than half. Obviously as you know we had a lot of case management contracts and customers before we even acquired Wiznet and built our e-filing solution but I think the way we look at it and the way we would look at the future which ensures what you are trying to quantify is we really feel regardless of whether or not it was part of the original engagement or not, it’s a high probability that as these systems are implemented and maybe they rest a little bit post-implementation but that virtually everybody is going to have a paperless court, which is really what e-file supports, it’s not just a filing instrument, and that we should have near complete saturation in our own customer base and that is the way we look at it.
Brian K. Miller: I think it’s important to note as well that even a number of our existing clients that have e-file aren’t at full run rate. So for example in Minnesota we have a statewide CMS system. E-file is being rolled out across the state currently. In Oregon we have – we are in the implementation for our case management solution and counties are coming online with e-filing as they come on to the court system but it’s not at full run rate yet. Same thing in Maryland. We are in the middle of an implementation; we have signed the statewide e-filing but aren’t recognizing any revenues there yet.
Brian Kinstlinger – Maxim Group:  So one more difficult question on e-file. If I exclude Texas e-file revenues down year over year, $0.5 million, and you’re talking about rolling more statewide workout, for example Minnesota, other counties have been won, so I’m surprised that with those wins that you’re seeing year over year X, again Texas you’re down, maybe you can provide some insight into that.
John S. Marr: I’m going to have to take a look. Yeah, and there are some places where volumes are down slightly. I know that one of the counties in Nevada, there’s just a little bit less e-filing, less court activity this year over the last year. We don’t necessarily view that as a trend. But I’ll have to take a look at those numbers.
Brian Kinstlinger – Maxim Group:  Okay, great. We’ll catch you back offline. Thank you.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Scott Berg from Northland Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.
Scott R. Berg – Northland Capital Markets: Hey John and Brian, congrats on a very solid quarter here. Quick question on the revenue piece in the quarter. If you look at the revenue piece and then your guidance for the fourth quarter, can you give us some understanding of how much of that is based on deals that are just borne off the balance sheet and backlog versus incremental deals that are signed or won during the quarter? I’m just trying to find the right way to view those two/
John S. Marr: It goes back to vision. So courts and justice, which obviously is the fast grower and clearly we did the second half plan with the California stuff coming online, that’s earning things out of backlog and as we said that’s really just exceptional execution there. Their billable hours are up about 50% over the last year, which is an incredibly challenging thing to do with a lot of new people, which we’ve had some great hires and aggressive onboarding and still delivering high quality service. So that deal is really burning through some backlog and executing well. I think the Munis division, which would be where the other big piece of that came from, where they do sell contract, deliver and recognize any quarter at times, it’s not a big number and there will be only a few million dollars, but they are beating their projected license number and that’s just sales and deliveries. So those would be the two biggest drivers. And then the other thing that contributes is when you have a number of quarters like we’ve had in a row that are even a little bit ahead of plan, everything else just runs together so you generally beat your maintenance by a little bit, you beat your SaaS number by a little bit, you beat your PS number by a little bit. And that’s momentum obviously that we enjoy right now. It should continue for a number of quarters. So again when you’re bringing in the new names and the new projects then all of those numbers generally tend to outperform by a little bit and it adds up to something meaningful.
Scott R. Berg – Northland Capital Markets: Certainly an impressive quarter that’s for sure.
John S. Marr: Thank you.
Scott R. Berg – Northland Capital Markets: Brian, I wanted to ask, ASPs in the quarter. Maybe it’s a question for John, I’m not sure but your ASPs for your 100K deals was – has been up every quarter year to date and actually higher on a year-over-year basis for six straight quarters. Usually we see companies have ASPs on large sales bounce around a little bit from quarter to quarter but that’s a pretty consistent trend. Is that a reflection of pricing increases on products or is it more customers buying more on the upfront sale or is there maybe a third dynamic going on in this?
Brian K. Miller: You mean in terms of the long-term trend of those increasing or this quarter where the average license was smaller?
John S. Marr: No, I can take – I think it’s – when we talk about improvement competitively the greatest gain in terms of improvement competitively is I think with would call the tier 2 space which is generally the higher end of our market space, excluding courts where they are certainly a tier 1 player. So that’s where we’ve seen a lot of improvement and there are a lot more of these $3 million, $4 million, $5 million deals when if you look back two or three years there were fewer of those and a lot more of the $400,000 to $800,000 deals.
Scott R. Berg – Northland Capital Markets: Great, then I guess we’ll –
John S. Marr: There hasn’t been any significant change in pricing.
Scott R. Berg – Northland Capital Markets: Okay. That’s great. And the last question I have then is I know that you guys have invested heavily in trying to staff professional services obviously to meet the large courts and justice deals that are up and John, you mentioned billable hours up 50% year-over-year. How should we think about them flowing over the next two or three quarters? Do those investments begin to moderate and you get better leverage in those lines and do you still see a fair amount of investment into that implementation area for another two to four quarter stretch?
John S. Marr: The headcount should flatten dramatically from here forward.
Scott R. Berg – Northland Capital Markets: Okay, that’s all I have. I’ll jump in the queue. Thank you.
Operator:  And our next question comes from Alex Zukin from Stephens. Please go ahead with your question.
Aleksandr J. Zukin – Stephens, Inc.: Hey guys, congratulations on another great quarter. I wanted to ask about the subscription deals, the cloud deals. What in your mind has led to that meaningful uptick in the quarter and do you guys internally have a ratio in mind and how was the performance in the quarter and maybe over the last over four quarters versus that ratio and how should you think – how should we think about for next year? I know a lot of questions are in there.
John S. Marr: Yeah, we do not really try to influence it too much and interestingly we like the mix. We’re getting up on that third of the new name area, great. As you can see in the financials we are still growing licenses, we are still growing earnings while we’re building a nice SaaS business and a lot of the SaaS companies are sacrificing earnings in order to do that. So it’s really the market share, the traction there is developing exactly where you would like it to, even though we are not over-influencing that, by this what I mean there isn’t any pricing bias or margin bias, they are on – the incentives for reps and management are similar. We really – our feeling as we should capture the customer, whichever way works best for the customer. And once they are a customer as you know they are a customer that’s almost forever, and so we’re not over-biasing that. I also think personally that our types of maintenance agreements, that are 98%, 99% retention, high-dollar maintenance agreements, high margin, that while the marketplace clearly distinguishes significantly between traditional on-premise maintenance revenues and SaaS revenues, I think our type of maintenance revenues are very valuable and the customers are very valuable if they happen to choose on an on-premise basis.
Aleksandr J. Zukin – Stephens, Inc.: That’s very helpful. Thanks a lot, John.
John S. Marr: Sure.
Aleksandr J. Zukin – Stephens, Inc.: Also just a question about the competitive environment and the win rates and what is your take on the potential for pricing power given the [MCATs] (ph) of the world getting taken out, you seem to be – you seem to have – to be in a position with a market-leading products where there is not a lot of competition. Just want to get your thoughts on that.
John S. Marr: Well, I would not factor in a lot of price increases. Obviously we are very active in the new business market, we want to have great relationships and be able to defend a very strong value proposition with our clients. We want them to talk that language when talking to prospective clients and I think that our current pricing as we achieve more and more scale and take advantage of that leverage it is giving us plenty of margin opportunity. So I wouldn’t factor in significant price increases. What I would say is maybe a year ago 18 months ago we were pleased with the improvement in our products and competitive position to win more deals. The next objective was to maybe win those deals by a wide enough margin that we could eliminate or marginalize the discounting that does go on in the marketplace and we do know that our discounting has been less aggressive. We haven’t had to discount as much. So that is a benefit that we’ll be pleased if there isn’t discounting. We can go forward with our model and just let the model work and we’ll see margins expand through that.
Aleksandr J. Zukin – Stephens, Inc.: Perfect. Thank you guys again.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Liu with B. Riley & Company. Please go ahead with your question.
Kevin Liu – B. Riley Caris: Hi good morning. Just looking at your guidance for the full year it looks like you guys would expect Q4 revenues to be slightly down given that your software backlog is actually up on a sequential basis. Just wondering if you could talk us through some of the factors; is it just conservatism, is it reflective of the mix of deals you expect people to take up funds versus getting in the backlog. Any help would – or any color would be helpful.
John S. Marr: Historically the third quarter is a strong quarter. And generally fourth quarter is a target to be somewhat flat. It’s not unusual and certainly we could have awards and performance that drives beyond that but there are some things in there. We get our increase in maintenance because it’s our highest renewals, so that the maintenance of existing customer base, there wouldn’t be much movement in that. That’s 60% of our revenues so that’s event that takes in place in July and doesn’t change too much of a degree the rest of the year. There actually are some third-party maintenance renewals that are recognized that are recognized once in the third quarter so that’s a one-time event that has to be replaced with other revenue growth in the fourth quarter. And holiday schedules and a number of things play into professional service because typically professional services are a little lighter in the fourth quarter. So you’re right, they look flat sequentially but you actually have to make up for a few things just to get too flat and certainly there is an opportunity to have some growth.
Brian K. Miller: And the timing of the professional services would be the biggest factor there probably with respect to just pure billable days as people take off the latter part of December to try to get a lot of implementation work done.
Kevin Liu – B. Riley Caris: Thanks, that’s helpful. And just one final question, with respect to your SaaS business. You have a number of conversions that you’re doing, it’s been fairly constant year over year. I’m curious as to whether you’re hearing more from your existing customers about interest on switching over or whether you expect this piece to continue on as we move forward.
John S. Marr: We haven’t seen any acceleration, you’re right, and I think a lot of those that had an interest early on have – we’ve addressed those. We’re very active going into those customer bases and trying to find those opportunities. We’ve talked about it before. And a catalyst typically would be people retiring and a change in skills or a need for a new infrastructure and a capital investment they’d like to avoid and our inside sales channel’s in tune with those opportunities and I think that will allow the pace to chug along as it is. At some point, we may do something that makes it more attractive to that base to try to accelerate that.
Kevin Liu – B. Riley Caris: Great. Appreciate you taking the questions and congrats on a solid quarter.
Operator: And our final question today comes from Matt Williams from Evercore. Please go ahead with your question.
Matthew L. Williams – Evercore Partners, Inc.: Hey good morning, guys, thanks for fitting me in. Two questions for me. Number one, Brian maybe if you could talk a little bit about some of the margin levers that you guys are looking both at the gross margin and the operating margin leverage going forward. I know gross margins you mentioned in the nine-month year-ago period were suppressed a little bit. So as we look out to 2015, thinking about 100 [BPS] (ph) of margin expansion there, what are some of the drivers at the gross and operating level?
Brian K. Miller: Well, clearly the most – there are two areas that have the most leverage. One is just the volume of the software licenses and with the very strong growth we’ve had we’ve seen a nice push from that. Obviously very high margin on the incremental revenues on licenses, close to 100% on those. And the second is the incremental leverage or incremental margin in the recurring revenues, both maintenance and particularly the transaction-based revenues. And as we mentioned as you just noted, last year we thought really an outsize effect there where we had more significant costs associated with the startup of eFileTexas ahead of those revenues. Now we have those revenues and the costs are mostly behind us. We have some more e-file projects, for example the one in Massachusetts is ramping up but they aren’t at the same scale as the Texas one. And actually the Texas revenues will continue to grow as well as other e-filing revenues. So those – just the incremental margins and the recurring revenues are the biggest lever there. In addition, I think we’re doing a good job of continuing to bring the service-to-license ratio down particularly on some of the larger projects, particularly in the courts space, where the service component, although still significant in most of the courts projects, is a less – is a smaller piece of the project and so that mix is helping us in growing the margins as well, so just a lower service mix.
Matthew L. Williams – Evercore Partners, Inc.:  Great, that’s helpful. I appreciate it. And then maybe just, John, maybe one for you. Given the cash balance that continues to build maybe just any comments on opportunities from an M&A standpoint, nothing specific but just what you are seeing in the market, how is the pricing environment and are there any opportunities that you guys might target over others, thanks.
John S. Marr: Funny when he said it was the last question I couldn’t believe we were going to get through the call without that question. Obviously cash was incredibly strong in the third quarter; got the highest cash position we’ve ever had and with the visibility we have in our business it’s going to continue to accumulate and create a stronger, stronger balance sheet. So we’re certainly aware of that. We certainly consider it a very important strategic opportunity to deploy that. And historically I think we’ve deployed our capital, especially with our repurchase, well and created a lot of shareholder value. You guys I’m sure know the market is pretty robust right now, it’s active, but it is expensive as well. We certainly are looking at the right opportunities very, very carefully and we have some things that we would love to achieve strategically and financially and we’ll look to be opportunistic and find the right opportunities
Matthew L. Williams – Evercore Partners, Inc.:  Great, thanks for the color and congrats on the quarter.
John S. Marr: Sure. All right, thank you for joining us on the call today and if you do have any further questions feel free to contact myself or Brian Miller.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today’s conference call. We do thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your telephone lines.

Operator: Hello, and welcome to today's Tyler Technologies Second Quarter 2014 Conference Call. Your host for today's call is John Marr, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded today, July 24, 2014. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Marr. Please go ahead.
John S. Marr: Thank you, and welcome to our second quarter 2014 earnings call. With me on the call today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like for Brian to give the Safe Harbor statement. Next, I'll have some preliminary comments, and Brian will review the details of our second quarter operating results and 2014 guidance. Then I'll have some final comments, and we'll take your questions. Brian?
Brian K. Miller: Thanks, John. During the course of this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information that may include projections concerning the company's future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We'd refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. John?
John S. Marr: Thanks, Brian. Our second quarter financial performance was, by virtually any measure, the best quarter in the company's history. From a historical perspective, this was our 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth and our 11th straight quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Our GAAP net income of $14.7 million made this our most profitable quarter ever and was our 53rd consecutive profitable quarter. Our recurring revenues from subscriptions and maintenance continue to be major growth drivers, as together they grew over 20% and represented approximately 59% of total revenues for the quarter. Our subscription revenue growth of 51% reflects strong growth in our e-filing revenues from courts, as well as a continuing gradual shift toward cloud-based software as a service business. Software license and royalty revenues achieved exceptional growth again this quarter, up almost 20% over last year. This was our first $12 million license quarter and the third consecutive quarter where licenses and royalty revenues were greater than $11 million and grew year-over-year by 20% or more. The growth in license revenue is particularly noteworthy in light of the number of new SaaS clients we signed this quarter, which also reached a new high. Gross margin improved 150 basis points to 47.1%, reflecting our high level of software licenses, as well as the earnings leverage in incremental recurring revenue, especially eFileTexas. This quarter we recorded our highest quarterly bookings ever with bookings increasing more than 63% over the second quarter of 2013. While the new California courts contracts were major contributors to the bookings growth, signings were very strong across all of our major products. We signed 13 new California courts contracts in the second quarter, and our Odyssey case management solution has now been selected by 25 of the 28 California counties, with signed contracts for new case management systems. This was led by our contract with the Los Angeles Superior Court, the largest court system in the United States, serving 10 million residents in the largest county in the nation. The contract is valued at approximately $32 million for software licenses and professional services. The court chose core Odyssey applications in e-filing for criminal, traffic, mainly juvenile and probate case types. Our other new clients in California this quarter include courts in San Diego, San Bernardino, Santa Clara and Alameda counties, all of which are among the 25 largest counties in the country. We also signed a contract, which has not previously been announced, with the courts in Santa Barbara County. In addition, we continue to expand our presence with Odyssey outside of California, with a SaaS contract valued at more than $3 million in Ector County, Texas. Finally, during the second quarter, we amended our Odyssey contract with the state of Maryland to provide statewide e-filing under a transaction-based arrangement. For our Munis ERP solution, our larger new on-premise contracts included the cities of Huntsville, Alabama, and Murfreesboro, Tennessee. The city of Wichita Falls, Texas, also signed a contract to implement Munis, as well as our Incode court case management solution. Our EnerGov planning, permitting and licensing solution acquired in late 2012 continues to gain momentum in the marketplace, with 4 new contracts valued at more than $1 million each in the second quarter, including Gilbert, Arizona; Charleston, South Carolina; and North Vancouver, British Colombia. In our Appraisal & Tax division, the city of Yonkers and towns of Greenburgh and Ossining, New York, selected our appraisal services business to conduct property assessments. All 3 municipalities are members of the Westchester County Multiple Municipal Reassessment Consortium, and the agreement collectively is valued at $9 million. We also signed several new appraisal services contracts in Indiana. And year-to-date, we have signed arrangements with 27 Indiana counties valued at approximately $13.5 million. We signed an arrangement with Johnson County, the largest county in Kansas, for our Orion appraisal and tax software solutions to manage tax collections and billings, as well as significant contracts for iasWorld tax and appraisal software with Multanomah County, Oregon, and Lexington County, South Carolina. Now, I'd like for Brian to provide more details on the results for the quarter and update our annual guidance for 2014.
Brian K. Miller: Thanks, John. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2014. Since our press release and 10-Q are both available, I'm going to add color around some of the key factors in the quarter and review our guidance for 2014, and then we'll move on to John's comments on the current quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2014. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. Our non-GAAP earnings exclude share-based compensation expense, the employer portion of payroll taxes on employee stock transactions and amortization of acquired intangibles. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. Revenues for the second quarter were $124.4 million, a new quarterly high, up 20.6%, and all of our growth was organic. Software license and royalty revenues increased 19.8%. In Q2, we received $576,000 of royalties on public sector sales of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 by other Microsoft partners, down from $687,000 a year ago. In addition, we had approximately $1.7 million of revenues related to Tyler's direct sales of Dynamics, which are included across our various revenue lines. In Q2 2013, revenues from our direct sales of Dynamics were $216,000. Subscriptions continue to be our fastest growing revenue line and increased 51.0%. We added 44 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 21 existing on-premise clients, representing approximately $18 million in total contract value, compared to 28 new arrangements and 15 conversions in the second quarter of 2013. This was a new quarterly high for us in terms of new SaaS client signings, both in number and dollar value, as well as a new high in conversions. Approximately 27% of our new software clients this quarter opted for one of our cloud-based solutions. The subscriptions line also includes the fast growing revenue stream from e-filing for courts and online payments. These revenues rose approximately 147% to $7.7 million from $3.1 million last year. Included in subscriptions revenues this quarter was approximately $4 million related to our Texas e-filing contract, which accounted for more than half of our subscription revenue growth. Our blended gross margin for the quarter rose 150 basis points to 47.1%. The increase reflects the higher level of license and royalty revenues as well as margin leverage from the incremental recurring revenues, primarily those from our Texas e-filing contract. Gross margin expansion was somewhat suppressed in the first 3 quarters of last year as we incurred costs ahead of revenues related to the Texas e-filing contract, with revenues starting in the fourth quarter. Our non-GAAP gross margin expanded by 140 basis points to 47.9%. SG&A expense increased 9.8% in the quarter and was 22% of total revenues, a decrease of 220 basis points from last year's second quarter. Noncash share-based compensation expense was $3.5 million compared to $2.9 million. $513,000 was included in cost of revenues and $3.0 million was included in SG&A expense. Excluding share-based compensation, SG&A expense increased only 8.8% with the biggest increase coming from commissions. Operating income was $23.6 million, an increase of 53.9%. Non-GAAP operating income was $28.7 million, up 44.4%. The non-GAAP operating margin improved 380 basis points to 23.1% as leverage in both SG&A and R&D expenses enabled us to grow operating income at a much greater rate than gross margin. Net income rose 62.9% to $14.7 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, which was 24% higher than our previous best quarter, which was Q1 of this year. The fully diluted share count increased by approximately 870,000 shares as the result of stock option exercises in the last year, offset somewhat by stock repurchases in the current quarter. Our effective tax rate was 37.0%. Non-GAAP net income was $18.4 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, up 50.2%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 43% to $30.7 million or $0.87 per diluted share. Free cash flow was $9.4 million compared to negative $9.2 million in last year's second quarter. Excluding real estate CapEx, our free cash flow was $9.7 million versus negative $2 million. During the second quarter, we repurchased 294,000 shares of our common stock for approximately $22.8 million at an average cost of $77.57 per share. This represented our first share repurchases since the fourth quarter of 2011. At the end of the second quarter, we had 32.8 million common shares outstanding and authorizations to repurchase up to a total of 1.4 million additional shares Days sales outstanding and accounts receivable improved to 104 days at June 30, 2014, compared to 106 days at June 30, 2013. DSOs increased sequentially from 66 days at March 31, which is our normal seasonal trend related to the timing of maintenance buildings. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $654.7 million, up 51.9% from last year's Q2. Backlog related to our software business, which excludes backlogs from appraisal services contracts, was $619.1 million, a 50.6% increase. Backlog included $154.4 million of maintenance compared to $139.8 million 1 year ago. Subscription backlog was $185.7 million compared to $101.2 million last year and included approximately $60.5 million related to the Texas e-filing contract. Our bookings for the quarter, which are calculated from the change in backlog plus revenues, were $239 million, up 62.6% from last year's second quarter. Our 13 new California courts contracts accounted for bookings of approximately $65 million in the second quarter. Excluding the new California courts contracts, bookings in the quarter grew approximately 18% over last year. Obviously, bookings can be somewhat lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, especially with respect to large contracts for which revenues are often recognized over several quarters or even years. Looking at bookings on a trailing 12-month basis can be useful in somewhat smoothing out the lumpiness. For the 12 months ended June 30, bookings were up approximately 48% over the prior 12-month period. These bookings include the contract for statewide e-filing in Texas, which was signed in the third quarter of last year. This is our only e-filing arrangement that was included in bookings and backlog at signing as it is our only fixed price e-filing arrangement. Excluding the Texas e-filing contract, bookings for the trailing 12 months rose approximately 35%. As a reminder, bookings do not fully reflect the true long-term value of new transaction-based contracts for e-filing or online payments. Revenue from these arrangements is recorded on a per-filing or per-transaction basis. And even though the volumes and future revenue streams may be very predictable, we do not include future revenues in bookings and backlog because they are dependent on those transactions occurring. Only the current quarter revenues from those arrangements hit bookings as they are reported. Therefore, current bookings and backlog do not capture the future revenue stream from those arrangements. It should be noted that 6 of our California courts contracts signed this quarter included transaction-based e-filing, and we expect that all of our California court software clients will eventually use Tyler for e-filing. We signed 43 new contracts in the second quarter that included software licenses greater than $100,000, and those contracts had an average license of $867,000 compared to 19 new contracts with an average license value of $687,000 in the second quarter of 2013. Our total headcount grew by 127 to 2,735 employees at the end of the second quarter compared to 2,608 at the end of the first quarter. Based on our results for the first half of the year and our current outlook for the balance of the year, we have revised upward our revenue and earnings guidance for the year. Our revised 2014 annual guidance is as follows. We currently expect 2014 revenues will be between $482 million and $489 million. We expect 2014 diluted GAAP EPS will be approximately $1.52 to $1.59. And fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be approximately 35.5 million to 36.5 million shares. We expect 2014 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be approximately $1.95 to $2.02. For the year, estimated noncash, share-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $15 million. We estimate an effective tax rate for 2014 between 38% and 40%. The tax rate may be somewhat volatile based on the effects of the timing and volume of stock option transactions throughout the year. We expect our total capital expenditures will be approximately $12 million to $13 million for the year. Total depreciation and amortization is expected to be between approximately $14.5 million and $15 million, including approximately $6.5 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to John for his further comments. John?
John S. Marr: Thanks, Brian. As I indicated earlier, we are very pleased with Tyler's second quarter performance, which is, by most measures, our best quarter in history. And as our revised guidance indicates, we have an increasingly positive outlook for the remainder of the year. Many of the factors contributing to our success this quarter have similar themes to last year. The local government market is active and has returned to prerecession levels. Most importantly, our competitive position is very strong across all of our major product suites, and our win rates continue to improve, which is enabling us to gain market share and expand our leadership position. As we noted earlier, Tyler achieved new highs in bookings and backlog this quarter. Our success in the California courts market, with 13 wins in the state this quarter, certainly was a major contributor. Timing of some of these contracts was accelerated in the quarter because some counties had time limits on the availability of funds. Although revenues for these contracts will be recognized over a number of years, the growth in backlog provides us with increasing visibility over future revenues. But our success and competitive strengths are much broader than just the California courts market. And even excluding the California deals, our bookings grew approximately 18% over last year's second quarter. In our court e-filing business, the efileTexas system continues to perform at a very high level. E-filing became mandatory in 12 more Texas counties on July 1. 77 Texas counties are currently live on eFileTexas, and our system is processing over 18,000 filings per day on behalf of its 75,000 registered users. We believe that eFileTexas can serve as a model for future e-filing systems in other jurisdictions across the country. With our Microsoft Dynamics AX relationships, results this quarter were again somewhat mixed. Our royalty revenues from the quarter from sales from other buyers [ph] were down from last year. Royalties these quarter represented sales in 11 countries. We expect that royalty revenue will continue to vary from quarter-to-quarter and represents both a risk and an opportunity in our short-term results. In our direct channel for Dynamics, revenues totaled $1.7 million, a substantial increase both sequentially from Q1 and over last year. Total Dynamics revenues from both channels were more than double last year's second quarter. Tyler added one new Dynamics client through our direct channel this quarter, the Portland Oregon Development Commission. Brian detailed our revised guidance for 2014 earlier in the call. The upward revision reflects our second quarter results, as well as our current assessment of the outlook for the remainder of the year. While we have an increasingly positive outlook for the year, there are variables regarding the mix of new business between our license and cloud models, as well as uncertainties over the timing of revenue recognition based on terms and conditions. In addition, as we mentioned last quarter, our tax rate may be somewhat more volatile than usual this year. And our diluted share count depends on both the level and timing of option exercises, as well as our stock price. We are pleased that we are continuing to grow revenues and expand margins, even as we grow our SaaS business at a high rate and continue to invest in future growth opportunities. With our exceptional backlog growth, we have plans to continue to hire aggressively in the second half of the year, adding more than 200 additional staff by year end. This will put some pressure on further near-term margin growth from the current quarter level as we absorb expenses associated with on-boarding new staff, which is taken into account in our second half guidance. As I said in the opening of the call, this is, by virtually all measures, our best quarter ever. And it's gratifying particularly because it really reflects what Tyler has been working towards since its entry into the software business now 16 years ago. It has been our objective to build a strong company with substantial resources exclusively focused on software and services to local government. These results reinforce our significant progress on delivering on that objective. While we enjoy a strong position in an important market, what really impresses me is the incredible execution from our nearly 3,000 employees every day. These are challenging projects, and through our employees' efforts, Tyler is consistently delivering at a very high level. Now we'll take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Scott Berg from Northland Capital Markets.
Scott R. Berg - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division: A couple of questions, John. How do you view pipelines right now given the strength in the quarter, even if you back out the anomaly in Courts & Justice deals in California? Obviously, you had a strong quarter across the rest of your businesses, but just trying to assess what those pipelines look like going forward and the potential opportunities there.
John S. Marr: Pipeline beyond backlog?
Scott R. Berg - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division: Yes, pipelines beyond backlog.
John S. Marr: Yes. Yes, nothing -- well, I shouldn't say nothing changes on June 30. The California anomaly, if you want to call it that, does cool down. A lot of them had a kind of a hard deadline to commit funds by June 30, so that did drive the 13 -- or having 13 decisions instead of whatever it would have been in California. Outside, though, of that, I don't see anything changing dramatically. I don't think that the other activity in the first half of the year, which was strong, changes dramatically as we go into the second half of the year. The market is healthy. As I said, it's back to prerecession levels. It's not particularly robust. It's just steady. But really, the higher levels of wins come mostly from our competitive position. The win rates are substantially higher than they were certainly a few years ago, and we continue to invest at a high level. This is not the result of a real high tide. All the players in this space are not getting these kinds of results. And I think that if we continue to invest the way we are, I don't see how our competitive position changes, again, as we go from one quarter to the next. So our expectation, outside of a little spike in California, is that it would remain at somewhere near this level as we go forward.
Scott R. Berg - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division: Okay, great. And then, John, as you look at the Dynamics revenues, obviously they're lower year-to-date on the royalty side, not your direct sales. But as you look at the remainder of '14, and I know your visibility is limited, but is there a scenario where those royalty numbers could actually be lower on a year-over-year basis?
John S. Marr: From their channel, they could be. I don't know. I don't think we believe that will be the case, but they could be. As we've said before, we have very little visibility into that. This current quarter, which is what we'll book next quarter, is their year end and traditionally is strong. So we have a little more built into the third quarter. As we said, that's both a risk and an opportunity, so it's hard to tell really from their channel. In our own channel, we certainly have a reasonable amount of activity. We certainly expect to continue to close deals as we do that. We build a recurring base slowly, and we put a lot of the people to work that we've put into our service channel there. So there's still a lot of investment, not just in the R&D side, but now in the sales and service side that the new business will begin to support. So it's hard to say on their channel. We have very little visibility in our own channel, and there's a reasonable amount of activity.
Scott R. Berg - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division: Okay, great. And then last question for me, Brian. As I look at your individual line item results in Q2, your ESS software services revenues had a substantial sequential jump from we'll call it $22 million in Q1 to $27 million in Q2. Is that $27 million kind of sustainable throughout the rest of the year? I'm just trying to understand for modeling purposes. Or do we see a little volatility in that number which was so high in Q2?
Brian K. Miller: I would expect that the level of services revenues, it was a little bit spiked this quarter. I'd expect that it would be, if you look at the next 2 quarters, maybe just slightly below that level, but not far off from that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Ho from William Blair.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Just starting out with the California contracts. I just wanted to get a little bit more color. I know we've had a lot of announcements come out, but it doesn't seem like this is for the entirety of the system. So can you maybe give us a sense of, number one, is this all that you expect from -- in the current counties that you've won? And can you maybe quantify how much additional opportunity is there?
John S. Marr: Yes, the -- every contract is different. So in some cases, it's for a number of case types, and in some cases, it's a single case type. But for the most part, the contracts aren't for everything. So there's certainly potential to add case types and expand the relationship beyond whatever the initial engagement is, in some cases substantially, in other cases, the initial engagement is more comprehensive. So I don't know that I can quantify that for you at this point in time, but certainly, there's opportunities beyond that. And as you know as well, eFile does not go into backlog. They're generally transaction based. They're not quantifiable. They're don't go into backlog. And even though they're a ways out, that, obviously, is a significant amount of business that's down the road.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Got it. And then just in terms of the win rates, I know you guys talked about that, outside of California being a bit stronger. Can you maybe give us a sense of how much that's picked up? Maybe talk a little bit about sort of the competitive landscape around Courts & Justice with some of the changes with your competitors and what you're seeing there.
John S. Marr: Sure, although we won't get too granular because we spend a lot of time on our own sales intelligence and not for everyone else. But I think what you see in California, that we won all but 3 deals, is at least their win rate in meaningful deals around the country. So that's probably our highest win rate area of our business right now. They're very, very strong in relation to the competition, and I think we continue to strengthen in relation to the competition. And again, not necessarily drilling down to every single county in the country, but in these large counties, statewide deals, the more meaningful deals, I think the California experience where you have the numbers is reflective of their experience around the country. Obviously, there are more players. The market is a little more horizontal. It's a vertical market, but we see players crossing over from other markets in financials and human capital management and these other areas. So I think achieving that level of market share would be very difficult. But I would say we've -- to give you a general idea, that if we were at the 50%-ish level, half of the market, and the other half being split by a number of competitors in those areas, that experience has moved up pretty significantly from there, maybe another 20% or so, which is significant, especially when you look at the smaller share of the market that's being spread out among a number of players. And that's really reflective of, I think, the beat we're experiencing this year, that the market is generally what we expected. What was in backlog, our recurring revenues, it's a big part of our business. So really, if you look at the raise in revenues and earnings, that's really obviously coming from our new business slice of our revenue mix, which is really only 20%, 25% of our revenues. So it's a pretty significant difference.
Operator: And our next question comes from Charlie Strauzer from CJS Securities.
Charles Strauzer - CJS Securities, Inc.: If you could talk a little bit, too, about your other competitor, AMK [ph], that went out of business recently and potentially the opportunity there of maybe if you have conversations with some of their customers but, more importantly, some of their key employees. As you're looking to ramp headcounts of qualified people, are you seeing some resumes from that transition?
John S. Marr: Geez, we never thought of that, Charlie. Well, first of all, they didn't go out of business. There's a broader business there. They're in the recording business. They're actually still in the eFile business. So they have a few lines of business. They made a conscious decision to exit the case management business and shut that business down. And obviously, their clients and their employees are opportunities for us. So we're certainly aware of that and putting strategies together on how to be responsive to both of those opportunities for ourselves. I think that's a dramatic thing for somebody to exit the market entirely that was a very significant player just a few years ago. But I think it represents something that's less apparent that's going on in the market regularly, and that is that companies are consolidating. Relevant new business and new market companies are slowly becoming more legacy, and I think fewer players remain relevant in the new business market. And along with our own investments and improvements, that's all contributing to the increased market share across our product lines.
Charles Strauzer - CJS Securities, Inc.: Great. And then shifting gears onto the appraisal side. You're starting to see the tide rise a little bit on appraisal again. And are you seeing kind of other opportunities like you're seeing in Indiana coming across the RFP pipeline at all?
John S. Marr: Yes. I mean, that business is very predictable. So every state has their cycles. We know what they are. They've been in place. And we have pretty good visibility several years out. We do not expect and we don't necessarily even desire that, that become an explosive growth business or even a business that grows at our broader growth rates. So I would continue to look at that as a lower growth part of our business, manage it for quality, reasonable margins, another very sticky point with our marketplace.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Schappel from Benchmark.
Mark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division: John, starting with you. How many California court systems are live today?
John S. Marr: Oh, I'd have to look. Obviously, none of the ones that have selected in the first half of this year are live. So it's a few, 3.
Brian K. Miller: Really -- yes, at this point, Kings County is fully live. And I'm sorry, San Luis Obispo is fully live. Kings County goes live not very far down the road. But there's one that is fully in production.
Mark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay, great. And then with respect to the L.A. County contract, if I recall they had something in the order of, like, 10 different court systems. Does the contract include all 10 of the court systems?
John S. Marr: You're talking about case types or different systems?
Mark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division: Yes, I believe, for example, they have, like, a juvenile court and a civil court.
John S. Marr: Okay. So case types. No, it doesn't include all of the case types.
Mark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division: Is it fair to assume that those other case types will come up for bid later on down the road?
John S. Marr: That's nothing we're certain of. That depends on their execution and relationship with their current solutions. The license fee actually does cover all case types. But the engagement in terms of services and certainly eFile would be expanded if other case types come up.
Mark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then...
John S. Marr: Maybe just civil, but it's not included, I believe.
Mark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then one last question. With respect to the Massachusetts e-filing project, I was wondering if you'll just give us a little bit of an update on where that stands.
John S. Marr: Well, the initial engagement in Massachusetts is strictly for a pilot, and we're in the process of implementing that. And the configuration is complete, it's loaded. We're doing the integration to third-party CMS solutions. And they do not have a specific go-live, but it might be somewhere around the end of this year. And then based on the performance of that project, the hope and expectation is that it will expand from the initial pilot.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Liu from B. Riley & Company.
Kevin Liu - B. Riley Caris, Research Division: First question. Just on the California deals you secured this quarter, I imagine you didn't get that much in revenue from it and most of it would have fallen into services. So I was wondering if you could clarify the amount and if that is indeed the case. And then also, as we move forward here, how you expect that the revenues from these 13 wins to start to flow through? Do we see fairly stable services and license revenues recognized each quarter? Or are some of these are -- on later time frames where you wouldn't really expect too much in revenue until next year?
Brian K. Miller: Yes, this quarter, we only recognized -- from the California deals we signed this quarter, we only recognized less than $1 million of revenue. And from all of the California contracts, including those signed in prior quarters in courts, we recognized a little less than $3 million in revenues. So relatively small related to the total volume of backlog. Those contracts have varying implementation schedules, some of them out as long as more than 4 years, in the case of Los Angeles. So we'll see them ramp up at various times. The licenses -- everything is a percentage of completion. The licenses are recognized pro rata as the services are earned. But we'll see them start to ramp up, but many varying schedules related to what are obviously a number of complicated engagements.
Kevin Liu - B. Riley Caris, Research Division: Got it. And then just with respect to headcount on the services side, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about kind of your hiring plans for the remainder of the year. Do you expect to be hiring at the same pace that we've seen so far thus far? Or would you expect costs to start to normalize here?
John S. Marr: Well, the hiring will accelerate in the second half of the year. I think we've said in our remarks we have about 200 heads in the second half planned. So pretty aggressive hiring. All of that -- in terms of people on board that aren't productive yet and the on-boarding costs, all of that is in our plan, which is reflected in our guidance. But we'll be adding heads aggressively in the second half.
Operator: And our next question comes from Alex Zukin from Stephens.
Aleksandr J. Zukin - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Two quick ones. The first, on the strength in the SaaS deals in the quarter, a really nice uptick on the amount of deals and the contract values. But then also, as a percentage, like, a little bit lower on a -- as a percentage of total. So can you just talk through kind of the puts and takes and how you view that number?
John S. Marr: Yes, it does jump around a little bit. I think it was what, just under 30% of the deals. The number is up significantly because total awards was up significantly. And I think that's about right. I think that's kind of about where we are. And it may run a little higher, a little lower from time to time, but it's steadily building momentum and gaining traction in that space. It is not a clearcut shift from on-premise to cloud. I think the government market is slower sometimes to adopt these things. They're on-premise systems, the people they employ, those departments are very entrenched in local government. And as I've said before, often the catalyst for buying a new system is different than the catalyst to moving toward a SaaS or a cloud arrangement. So you see that we have a lot of what we call these flips where our -- I mean, we're thrilled to bring in an on-premise client even in today's cloud world. And often, down the road, maybe when they have a change in people that have worked there a long time or they require big infrastructure investments, some other catalyst causes them to move from an on-premise customer to a cloud customer. So I think it'll continue to be a slow build in our market, but that's a pretty good slice of our new business and that's probably about right in terms of expectation.
Aleksandr J. Zukin - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Got it. That's helpful. And then, Brian, one for you around the guidance for revenue growth in the second half. It looks like it's a slight deceleration from where we've seen in the first half. Can you talk about maybe is that conservatism or around how you're thinking of the timing some of these deals coming into the pipe?
Brian K. Miller: Yes, I think it's our assessment of how we ramp up to some of this new business. And actually, revenues grew quite a bit in the second half of last year. So the comparison is a little bit tougher. So the growth rate decelerates a little bit, but still looking at a solid north of mid-teens kind of growth for the year. The services was at a high level this quarter. That'll continue to ramp up as we bring resources online. Licenses, I think, we would expect to be kind of in this range in the rest of the year. And as we said, margins, we would expect on a gross margin basis to be in a similar range to where we were this quarter. Obviously, we saw very strong margin growth year-over-year. But as we bring these people on board and absorb those costs, it'll probably plateau a little bit around this gross margin range for the next couple of quarters. But part of that just has to do with a tougher comp from the growth we saw starting in the second half of last year, particularly as eFileTexas started revenues in Q4 of last year. So that's been a -- that obviously is a big contributor to the revenue growth this quarter and last.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Matt Williams from Evercore.
Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: One that might be a little difficult to quantify and I've realized that up front, but given the strong bookings and backlog associated with the California deals primarily, is there any color that you can provide around sort of the duration, maybe specific to the California contracts? And then the duration of that backlog on an average basis of the deals that aren't associated with California? So essentially, I was just trying to get a sense of timing of when we can, from a modeling standpoint, start to expect some of this stuff to roll through. And I realize it's obviously different on a county-by-county basis.
John S. Marr: Yes, I think our general -- as Brian indicated, our revenues in the second quarter were pretty insignificant from California. There's a tremendous amount of activity in the market and they had a big effect on bookings and backlog, but still not that significant in our financial statement. And that'll start to build in the second half, and it'll be a significant contributor really over the next 3 to 5 years, the business that we're doing there. And I think there will always be another market, but that is a bit of an outsized market. So there may not be other deals that completely replace that new business as it runs off a few years -- starts to run off a few years out. That said, I think the follow-on in California, as the maintenance agreements come into place and then followed by e-filing beginning to ramp up, the revenues will be replaced by recurring revenues and new business in other places. And while that may not support this level of growth, I wouldn't look for this level of growth on an ongoing basis, it will provide a favorable revenue mix and a margin opportunity as recurring revenues are generally more profitable than new business revenues.
Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: And I guess maybe a quick follow-up on that sort of second point there. The e-filing opportunity over the longer term seems to be particularly compelling from my point of view. For the California counties that are contracted for the court case management side of things, is there an opportunity for them to sort of go live with e-filing ahead of the broader Odyssey implementation? Or is it a case of Odyssey needs to get set up and implemented before e-filing can really start to flow through for those counties?
John S. Marr: Yes, I think anybody going live with e-filing ahead of having their case types up would be isolated. Generally, you should think of it as a follow-on to the implementation and the go-live for the case types.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, at this time, I would like to turn the conference call back over to management for any closing remarks.
John S. Marr: Okay, thank you and thank you all for participating in our call today. If you have any further questions, feel free to contact Brian or myself. Thanks again. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your telephone lines.

Operator: Hello, and welcome to today's Tyler Technologies First Quarter 2014 Conference Call. Your host for today's call is John Marr, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, April 24, 2014. [Operator Instructions] I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Marr. Please go ahead.
John S. Marr: Thank you, Andrew, and welcome to our First Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. With me on the call today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like for Brian to give the Safe Harbor statement, then I'll have some preliminary comments. Brian will review the details of our first quarter results and updated 2014 guidance. Then I'll have some final comments, and we'll take your questions. Brian?
Brian K. Miller: Thanks, John. During the course of this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information that may include projections concerning the company's future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Please note that all growth comparisons we make today on the call will relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless we specify otherwise. John?
John S. Marr: Thanks, Brian. Our first quarter results built upon the solid finish to 2013. From a historical perspective, this was our 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth, and our eighth straight quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Our GAAP net income of $11.9 million made this our most profitable quarter ever. Historically, we have very little or no sequential revenue growth from the fourth quarter of one year to the first quarter of the next. In this quarter, we did better than that with sequential revenue growth of $3.7 million. We have to go back to 2009 to find the last time when earnings increased sequentially from Q4 to Q1. And that was the only time it happened in the last 14 years. Our recurring revenues from subscriptions and maintenance continue to be major drivers of our growth, as together they grew 19% and represented approximately 63% of total revenues for the quarter. Our subscription revenue growth of 52% reflects a continuing shift toward cloud-based Software-as-a-Service businesses, as well as strong growth in our e-filing revenues from courts. Software license and royalty revenues also had excellent growth, up 27% over the last year. This is the second consecutive quarter where licenses and royalty revenues were greater than $11 million, and grew year-over-year more than 27%. Gross margin improved 80 basis points to 46.6%, reflecting our high level of software licenses, as well as the earnings leverage from incremental recurring revenues. We had a solid quarter from our new contract signings, with bookings for the quarter very strong in our financial in ERP solutions, and appraisal services. And somewhat light for courts and justice, where bookings tend to be somewhat lumpier than elsewhere in our business. I'll discuss that specifically later in the call. Some of the more notable contract signings in the quarter included an agreement valued at $5.8 million with Kansas City, Missouri, to replace its aging permitting software with our EnerGov planning, permitting and licensing solution. We are starting to see good traction in the market with EnerGov, which we acquired in 2012, both in standalone opportunities, and in conjunction with our new -- with contracts in our Incode and Munis ERP solutions. We also signed an EnerGov contract valued at nearly $2 million with the city of Henderson, Nevada. For our Munis ERP solution, we announced agreements with the cities of Pasadena, California, and Rapid City, South Dakota, as well as Portage County, Wisconsin. We also signed new Munis contracts with Bloomington, Minnesota and Greenville, North Carolina and contracts for our Incode solution with Draper City, Utah, and Seguin, Texas. We signed a contract to deliver our iasWorld property appraisal and tax administration software and services to the Ministry of Home Affairs in Brunei, a sovereign state located in the north corner of the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia. We expanded our courts e-filing business as the common wealth of Massachusetts signed a contract for our Odyssey File & Serve product to power a 6 court e-filing pilot program, which is expected to lead to e-filing being expanded to courts across the state. This is a transaction-based revenue arrangement. We also announced 2 significant products during the quarter. The first is the launch of our iasWorld Field Mobile Solution for Windows 8. Field Mobile is designed to allow appraises to work with the iasWorld property review workflow features, while collecting and updating property characteristics in the field, both online and off. This application is the first tablet solution for appraisers built on Windows 8, integrating directly with our iasWorld appraisal and tax administration system. We also launched the Odyssey File & Guide solution, which provides courts with the powerful suite of tools to guide self-represented litigants through the process of completing court forms, and filing cases online. Courts can now easily create web-based interviews for their court, by leveraging the library of existing interviews from other jurisdictions in the Odyssey filing guide authoring tool. This provides courts with an easy way to produce online interviews that apply the business rules of the court and guide self-represented litigants with relevant and informative content about the rules of the court. We believe that the application adds significant value to our e-filing solution and further strengthens our competitive position as the leader in court's e-filing. Now I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results of the quarter and our annual guidance for 2014.
Brian K. Miller: Thanks, John. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2014. Since our press release and 10-Q are both available, I'm going to add color around some of the key factors in the quarter and review our guidance for 2014. Then we'll move on to John's comments on the current quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2014. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. Our non-GAAP earnings exclude share-based compensation expense, the employer portion of payroll taxes on employee stock transactions and amortization of acquired intangibles. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. Revenues for the first quarter were $112.6 million, a new quarterly high, up 17.6%, and all of our growth was organic. Software license and royalty revenues increased 27.2%. In Q1, we received $659,000 of royalties on public sector sales of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 by other Microsoft partners, down from $891,000 a year ago, but up sequentially from $473,000 in Q4. In addition, we had approximately $1.3 million of revenues related to Tyler's direct sales of dynamics, which are included across our various revenue lines. In Q1, 2013, revenues from our direct sales of dynamics were $272,000. Subscriptions continues to be our fastest growing revenue line, and increased 52.2%. We added 32 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 15 existing on-premise clients, compared to 22 new arrangements and 19 conversions in the first quarter of last year. Approximately 27% of our new software clients opted for one of our cloud-based solutions, compared to 33% of new clients in the first quarter of 2013. The subscription line also includes a fast-growing revenue stream from e-filing for courts and online payments. These revenues rose approximately 150% to $7.5 million from $3.0 million last year. Included in subscriptions revenue this quarter was approximately $3.9 million related to our Texas e-filing contract, which accounted for a little more than half of our subscription revenue growth. We expect to continue to see long-term growth in the these revenues as both current courts clients and new clients like Texas and Massachusetts adopt our Odyssey File & Serve solution, and more of them move towards mandatory e-filing. Our blended gross margin for the quarter rose 80 basis points to 46.6%. The increase reflects the higher level of license and royalty revenues, as well as margin leverage from the incremental recurring revenues, offset somewhat by startup costs from new staff and e-filing implementations. Our non-GAAP gross margin also expanded by 80 basis points to 47.5%. SG&A expense increased 12% in the quarter and was 22.5% of total revenues, a decrease of 110 basis points from last year's first quarter. Noncash share-based compensation expense was $3.5 million compared to $2.6 million. $513,000 was included in cost of revenues and $3.0 million was included in SG&A expense. Excluding share-based compensation, SG&A expense increased 9.9%. Operating income was $19.9 million compared to $14.5 million, an increase of 37.3%. Non-GAAP operating income was $25.0 million, up 33.3%. The non-GAAP operating margin improved 270 basis points to 22.2%, as leverage in both SG&A and R&D expenses enabled us to grow operating income at a much greater rate than gross margin. Net income was $11.9 million or $0.33 per diluted share, compared to $8.5 million or $0.25 per diluted share. The fully diluted share count increased by approximately 1.6 million shares as a result of stock option exercises in the last year. Our effective tax rate in Q1 was 39.4%. Non-GAAP net income was $15.4 million or $0.43 per diluted share, up 34.6% compared to $11.5 million or $0.34 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2013. Adjusted EBITDA, which is EBITDA plus noncash share-based compensation expense, was $26.9 million or $0.76 per diluted share, an increase of 32.7% compared to $20.2 million or $0.60 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2013. Free cash flow was $12.9 million compared to $12.0 million in last year's first quarter. Excluding real estate CapEx, our free cash flow was $13.4 million versus $14.9 million. Cash flow in the first quarter of last year benefited from the early payment of a portion of incentive compensation, which moved into Q4 of 2012 approximately $4.6 million of incentive payments that would have been made in Q1 of last year. We did not repurchase any stock during the first quarter, but have repurchased some stock in April, which represents our first stock repurchases executed since the fourth quarter of 2011. Day sales outstanding and accounts receivables improved to 66 days at March 31, 2014, compared to 72 days at March 31, 2013. DSOs decreased sequentially from 87 days at December 31, 2013, which is our normal seasonal trend related to the timing of maintenance billings. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $540.3 million, up 39.8% from last year's Q1. Backlog related to our software business, which excludes backlog from appraisal services contracts, was $508.8 million, a 41% increase. Backlog included $117.0 million of maintenance, compared to $111.9 million a year ago. Subscription backlog was $183.2 million, compared to $97.3 million last year, and included approximately $64.5 million related to the Texas e-filing contract. Our bookings for the quarter, which are calculated from the change in backlog plus revenues, were $101.0 million, down 1.1% from last year's first quarter. It should be noted that bookings in Q1 of last year included an unusually high number of multiyear staff contract renewals and conversions from on-premise clients, as well as the statewide courts contract with Rhode Island. For the 12 months ended March 31, bookings were up approximately 36% over the prior 12-month period, including the Texas e-filing contract. Excluding the effects of Texas e-filing agreement, bookings in Q1 were up 2.7% over Q1 of last year. As a reminder, bookings will not reflect the true value of new transaction-based contracts for e-filing or online payments, such as the one we signed with Massachusetts in Q1. Revenue from these arrangements is recorded on a per filing or per transaction basis, and even though the volumes in future revenue streams maybe very predictable, we do not include future revenues and bookings, because they're dependent on those transactions occurring. Only the current quarter revenues from those arrangements hit bookings as they are recorded. Therefore, current bookings and backlog did not capture the future revenue stream from those arrangements. The e-file Texas contract differs from our other e-filing contracts in that it is a 4-year contract that was converted to a fixed revenue arrangement from its original per filing structure. As a result, we included the total value of that contract of $71.5 million in bookings in the third quarter of 2013, and the backlog related to it will work down as revenues are recognized over its term. Had that remained a transaction-based arrangement, as it was originally structured, there would be nothing in backlog related to that contract, and we would record in bookings each quarter's billings as they occur. Conversely, with the Massachusetts e-filing contracts we signed in Q1, nothing has bookings or backlogs in the current quarter. And when the system is implemented and begins processing filings, each quarter's revenues will hit bookings as they are earned. We signed 22 new contracts in the first quarter that included software licenses greater than $100,000, and those contracts had an average license of $451,000, compared to 11 new contracts with an average license value of $418,000 in the first quarter of 2013. Our total headcount grew to -- grew by 35 to 2,608 employees at the end of first quarter, compared to 2,573 at the end of the fourth quarter. Based on our first quarter results and our current outlook for the balance of the year, we have revised upward our revenue and earnings guidance for the year. Our revised 2014 annual guidance is as follows. We currently expect 2014 revenues will be between $470 million and $478 million. We expect 2014 diluted GAAP EPS will be approximately $1.39 to $1.46, and fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be approximately 36 million to 37 million shares. We expect 2014 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be approximately $1.83 to $1.90. For the year, estimated noncash share-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $15 million. We expect an estimated -- we estimate an effective tax rate for 2014 between 39% and 41%. The tax rate may be somewhat volatile based on the effects of the timing and volume of stock option transactions throughout the year. We expect our total capital expenditures will be approximately $12 million to $13 million for the year. Total depreciation and amortization is expected to be between approximately $15 million and $15.5 million, including approximately $6.5 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to John for his further comments.
John S. Marr: Thanks, Brian. We are pleased with Tyler's first quarter performance, which by most measures was our best quarter in history. And as our revised guidance indicates, we have a positive outlook for the remainder of the year. Many of the factors contributing to our success this quarter are similar themes to last year. Activity in the local government market has returned to prerecession levels and remains good. Our competitive position is very strong and our win rates continue to improve, which has enabled us to gain market share and expand our leadership position in this space. Similar to last year, our quarterly bookings were relatively flat with the same quarter of the prior year. Breaking this down a little further, on the perpetual license side, we had strong bookings for our ERP solutions, with both the number and average licenses for larger deals increasing. This was offset somewhat by a lower level of SaaS contracts. With our Courts & Justice solutions, where there are typically fewer, but larger deals, and the timing of new contracts varies from quarter-to-quarter, we did not have any significant new software contracts in Q1. And the Massachusetts e-filing contract did not contribute to bookings, because it is transaction-based. Our confidence in the outlook for the rest of 2014 and beyond, however, is supported by a pipeline of new business opportunities across our product lines that is at an all-time high. That pipeline includes a significant number of unsigned awards. The California courts market is currently very active, and we expect the courts in a number of counties, including some of the larger counties in the state, will sign contracts this year for our new case management system and that we will continue to build on our early leadership position in that market. As of today, we have been selected by 13 of the 16 California courts that have signed contracts for new court case management systems. We did not sign any new courts in the state in Q1, but have signed 1 new contract since the end of the quarter. We've been notified of our selection in several other counties, and there are certain funding considerations which we expect will lead to some contracts being executed in the second quarter. We also expect that most, if not all, of our Odyssey contracts in California, will ultimately include transaction-based e-filing arrangements. And while today there is obviously a great deal of interest in the California courts market, we continue to have a solid pipeline of Odyssey opportunities in other states. In our courts' e-filing business, our e-file Texas system is performing extremely well, and we continue to bring in additional counties live in this system on an optional basis. With mandatory e-filing from the next wave of 12 counties in Texas set to take place on July 1. As mentioned earlier, we signed an agreement in Q1 with Massachusetts for a pilot e-filing program that is expected to ultimately lead to a full statewide e-filing system. Results for our Microsoft Dynamics AX relationship this quarter was somewhat mixed. Our royalty revenue from this quarter from sales from bars were down from last year, but up sequentially from Q4. Royalties this quarter represented sales in 13 countries around the world. We expect that the royalty revenues may be somewhat lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, and represent both a risk and an opportunity in the short-term results. In our direct sales channel for Dynamics, we signed 1 new contract during the quarter with the San Francisco County Municipal Transportation Authority in California. We also have several unsigned awards for Dynamics. Our Dynamics implementations in progress are going well, and our installed Dynamics customers are referenceable. Brian detailed our revised guidance for 2014 earlier in the call. The upward revision reflects our first quarter results, as well as our current assessment of the opportunities and risk in our plan. While we have an increasingly positive outlook for this year, there are uncertainties regarding the mix of new business between our license and cloud models, as well as uncertainty over the timing of revenue recognition based on the terms of new contracts. In addition, as we mentioned earlier, our tax rate may be somewhat more volatile than usual this year. And our diluted share count depends on both the level and timing of option exercises, as well as our stock price. While all of these variables suggest a range of potential financial results for the balance of 2014, I'm very pleased with the broad market recovery. Tyler's considerably improved competitive position, as well as, and maybe most importantly, the execution of our team has achieved on significant -- on the significant number of new projects underway. All of this adds up to a strengthened leadership position. We are a busy company executing in a high level and I want to thank the more than 2,600 Tyler employees responsible for these results. Now, Andrew, we will take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brian Kinstlinger of Sidoti & Company.
Brian Kinstlinger - Sidoti & Company, LLC: The first question I had, you mentioned John in California, you've signed a number -- sorry, you've been awarded a number of case management deals that are unsigned. Outside of the 16 that have awarded, and 3 on to you, are you also aware of any other county courts that have awarded to a different MSA than you?
John S. Marr: No, just the 3.
Brian Kinstlinger - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Great. And then the follow-up would be, you also mentioned California, you expect to include e-file with the court contract wins on case management, yet some of the counties have an e-file software vendor already. In those cases, do you expect to fully replace that vendor, or would there be 2 options for filings?
John S. Marr: Could be a little of both. There certainly could be multiple options, and on the front-end, it's actually a requirement in California. But we would expect to -- that most of our engagements eventually include us as the primary e-file solutions.
Operator: Your next question comes from Charlie Strauzer of CJS securities.
Charles Strauzer - CJS Securities, Inc.: When you look at the guidance that you're giving out, the revised guidance here, what assumptions are you building in for California and also for dynamics, if any?
John S. Marr: There is very little built in to our current year guidance for unsigned contracts at this point in time in the Courts & Justice area. Most of their work will be projects out of backlog. So some of these awards that are not yet contracted will require that we get started, and we will, but I think our risk there is pretty limited. And on the other hand, there won't be a tremendous amount of upside, as it will take time to ramp those opportunities up. In the financial side of our business, it is more typical that we sign contracts, deliver software and recognize revenue, whereas almost everything is POC on the courtside. I think our assumptions on dynamics are pretty conservative, and therefore, if the revenues continue to be relatively light, which is where I characterize them now, that exposure is somewhat limited, and I would expect it would be offset by strength in other areas. And certainly, we're hopeful that those revenues accelerate and contribute at a higher level, and that will be upside.
Charles Strauzer - CJS Securities, Inc.: And John, just expanding on dynamics, if you could a little bit more. When you kind of go into some of the RFP processes, bidding with your dynamics offering on direct model, and when you win or lose, what are some of the factors that would cause that decision to be made either for or against you, that you're seeing become more recent?
John S. Marr: Yes, it's a good question. And obviously, our proprietary products are very strong in some of those marketplaces. So it is a bit of a challenge for us to position all of these products properly. The award we mentioned on the call is a Transportation Authority, and some of these authorities, and some of these kind of complementary markets in our space are very good places for dynamics to play and initiatives that we're developing. Being a newer system, this would be true of really any newly launched system. Its strengths are its user experience, the stack of technology, the interfaces to other products. Really, at a high level, the product shows very well and is pretty exciting product, and is being received that way in the marketplace. A challenge with any new product is the depth of the functionality. And in our core markets, those requirements are very, very detailed, and we're confident that dynamics will build those out over time. But that might be the area that it's most challenged. But it's definitely received as an exciting product, a strong user experience, technology is attractive to people. And those that want an earlier stage product that will be going up its bell curve in terms of functionality are interested in it.
Operator: The next question comes from Scott Berg of Northland Capital Markets.
Scott R. Berg - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division: John, can you comment on the percentage of deals that went SaaS in the quarter is the -- and I know they typically are smaller deals, but it was the second quarter in a row where it's been kind of sub-30%. Can you talk about what's in the -- how you view the pipelines today, is that -- should that be viewed as the current trend, or I believe the view 3 months ago was a higher level of SaaS deals, likely in the pipelines for the year?
John S. Marr: Anything we can measure would suggest that, that's probably still a pretty good percentage to look for. You want to remember that it pretty much doubled in the weaker environment in 2010 and '11. And I do believe that part of that was not just a choice of technically how our product was deployed, but a little bit based on the financial environment, and it eliminated the capital investment that was needed to purchase a new system, and at some jurisdictions that needed a new system, but weren't in a position to make the capital investment, selected it, again more as a financial decision on the way they acquired it rather than a technical choice. And so I think, right now, the market in terms of its conversion to SaaS is probably catching up with that. So it's stalled a little bit. So I think long-term we may stall there a little bit to catch up with that dynamic, and I would expect it to begin to grow again once that's occurred.
Scott R. Berg - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division: Great. Then the dynamics revenues were up sequentially for the second quarter in a row where -- I know you've been -- this point might not be the exact term, but they've been later than expectations? Is that more on the -- you've seen that more in the new business side, or is the conversions of existing customers on maintenance maybe converting to the new versions slower than expected?
John S. Marr: Probably a little of both. And I'd remind you that, conversions, there is very little or no license revenue that we did agree with Microsoft that conversions that could be kind of our evergreen strategy and theirs, but customers' ability to swap out a Microsoft or a Tyler product, they get credit for the investment they had, obviously both of us are very interested in the longer-term recurring revenues, and we're trying to build that from a base as well. So there are some conversions going on that may not show up initially as licenses, but will begin to grow the base of our current revenues.
Scott R. Berg - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division: Fantastic. Then the last question I have for Brian. I believe you mentioned in your remarks, you bought back a few shares in the month of April. Any color on the size or number of shares there. And how you view your buybacks for the rest of the year -- calendar year?
Brian K. Miller: Not really. We typically don't disclose the specific numbers until we get to the end of the quarter. But -- so we'll just leave it at that.
Operator: The next question comes from Jonathan Ho of William Blair.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Can you give us a little bit more detail regarding, maybe the size or the quantity of contracts that were pushed out from Q1 to Q2? And was that sort of a surprise. So can you maybe talk a little bit about why it is that those contracts were pushed out?
John S. Marr: I'm not even sure they're pushed out. It's just the timing of the market. It wasn't really so much that these deals weren't awarded and contracted. It's just a natural cycle that they were in, but it does appear that there've been a number of awards, and then we expect there will be more, and we would anticipate that a reasonable number of those will be contracted in the second quarter. I appreciate the interest in us being more granular on that, but it's hard to know when an award actually gets contracted and I hate to get in a position where we were -- have leverage against us to get contracts signed by the end of Q2. So I guess our color at a high level is that, even though bookings weren't particularly robust in the first quarter, the market is very active. We feel very good about the position we are in, and a lot of those particular opportunities, and we see some of that in the way of awards already, and we do expect that contracts in the quarter should be strong.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Got it. And then you talked about sort of the broader environment getting back to levels at sort of the pre-downturn phase, and continuing to improve. Can you give us a little bit more color in terms of how you see that trend, and do you think things will actually get to sort of above average status over the next 12 to 18 months? Just want to get a little bit of a sense around that.
John S. Marr: It's pretty stable right now. Now it clearly rose to an elevated level beginning last summer, which is an unusual time for things to get that busy. So at that time we were pleased, and yet we were uncertain as to whether that was pent-up demand, deferred decisions that needed to be made, and a little bit of spike. And I would say now, 3 quarters later that, that market has been sustained. And as we've characterized it, it's a good market, and it's strong, it's consistent with prerecession levels. It's not incredibly robust. It's just a good solid regular market. Quite frankly, we're very satisfied with that. And if that's the level that sustained over the next couple of years, we're pleased with that. But the bigger change in our results has everything to do with our competitive position. So across the board our win rates are up, and we expect for that to continue, and that's what we're focused on and investing as we go forward.
Operator: The next question comes from Raghavan Sarathy of Dougherty & Company.
Raghavan Sarathy - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division: Just a few questions from my end. You talked about the Massachusetts e-filing opportunity. You said it's starting up, is the e-filing mandatory in the state, or if it becomes mandatory, or what could -- how big this opportunity could be if it's adopted statewide.
John S. Marr: It is not mandatory at this point. In the 6 jurisdictions that are part of the pilot are relatively small. So the amount of revenue in this year's plan is pretty insignificant, quite frankly. It would probably be a full year from now before we see meaningful revenues from that. And we don't control whether those are just higher adoption rates, and a broader footprint or whether it actually goes mandatory. But it is our hope, and the clients' as well, that the exposure would be significantly higher a year from now. The volumes would suggest that this could be a, say, a $4 million to $8 million run rate, depending on whether it's mandatory or just higher traction.
Raghavan Sarathy - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then my second question is on license revenue growth, which you talked about. In the past, we have seen a switch to SaaS impacting your license revenue growth. Last couple of quarters, you reported 27 plus percent license revenue growth. Can you talk about how we should think about the license revenue growth for the year as a whole?
Brian K. Miller: Well we don't report that breakdown as you know, but certainly I wouldn't want the expectation to be at 27% for the year. But it certainly would be -- our expectation would be -- certainly would be up double digits. And so we are pleased, obviously, in the first quarter to have 52% growth in subscriptions granted, a fair amount of that coming from e-file Texas. But strong subscription growth along with strong perpetual license growth is a really good combination for us, and we do expect for the year that both of those will be up at significant levels.
Raghavan Sarathy - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division: And just 1 final question. We are looking at the tough [ph] comparisons for the bookings for the second quarter, so you had a couple of large deals last year second quarter. You seemed bullish about the business. Should we expect bookings to go up in the second quarter given you seem to indicate you have a number of unsigned awards?
Brian K. Miller: I'd have to look back at second quarter of last year. I don’t know that number off top of my head. As I said, I think the number and size of the counts will sign in the second quarter will be significant. And it will be a good number. But I don’t know the comparison off the top of my head.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Schappel of Benchmark.
Mark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division: John, in the recent past, I think you've cited competitive win rates of about 70% in your core ERP business, and about 80% in your Courts & Justice business. I was wondering if those win rates held up in the quarter?
John S. Marr: I guess I'd have to look at exactly what I said, 70% probably a little high. It's in that range, when we are in the finals. But there are usually deals that are not in our core market, that occasionally, don't make the finals. So if you're talking about percentage of wins to actual bids, it's a little lower than that. But certainly up over the last couple of years, and I think that's a pretty good number for Courts & Justice. There are few meaningful losses over the last few years.
Mark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay, thanks. And then, I was just wondering if you could just give us a little bit of an update on your implementation capacity, especially with respect to your confidence level to ramp up for the other projects in California?
John S. Marr: We feel good about it. Certainly, one of the challenges that a growing company like this has, and it's a challenge you like to have, but we have a strong core of strong professionals with the right subject matter expertise and the right experience to execute on these projects. And certainly, we are adding people, but obviously we are adding them at the lower end of the skill set to join the team. But I think all of our teams will have seasoned veterans leading the projects and that's what's important. So certainly, that is something we are very, very focused on. But we -- it's what we do well. And especially in the Courts & Justice area where the growth is at the highest level, it's something that they've been preparing for some time and with the leadership, that division does very well. So we will be adding a lot of people. Those costs are in our plan. There was a lot of onboarding in the second half of last year in the financial side of our business. And we are largely through that, and we are in that process now on the Courts & Justice side.
Operator: The next question comes from Kevin Liu of B. Riley & Co.
Kevin Liu - B. Riley Caris, Research Division: Wanted to clarify one thing on the Massachusetts e-filing win. If it does hit that $4 million to $8 million run rate eventually, does that assume that you guys just roll out a little bit more beyond kind of the 6 initial pilot counties, or do you expect a statewide roll out?
John S. Marr: Yes, the higher end of that range would either require very high adoption rates, or mandatory and statewide.
Kevin Liu - B. Riley Caris, Research Division: Got it. And for the unsigned awards you feel like you're going to get for California, are any of those going to come in as SaaS transactions?
John S. Marr: I'd expect some of them would, and some of them have. And we also have set up arrangements with multicounty hosted arrangements, so that the smaller jurisdictions, rather than bearing the cost of a full implementation have collaborated on a hosted solution. So we do have a combination in the state.
Kevin Liu - B. Riley Caris, Research Division: Okay. And just 1 last one. On the appraisal services, the revenues there were down in Q1, but bookings and backlog were pretty strong, so just curious what's factored in the guidance in terms of how much growth or kind of revenue flowing out of backlog we should expect to see over the coming quarters?
John S. Marr: The tax and appraisal division is really split with its appraisal service business, as well as its tech or software business. The appraisal service business will be a little stronger this year, but generally is managed to be a relatively flat part of our business. As you may know, years ago, it was 27% of our revenues, and now it is around 4%. And so that's somewhat by design. It's an important offering. And another sticky point that we offer to our clients. But we would expect those revenues to be low growth, or somewhat stable over time. There tech or software business is now growing in line with, say our financial software business. So that's where we'll see more growth in that side of the business.
Brian K. Miller: And we do expect that appraisal services, although it's down in Q1, a lot of that really was related to weather. Because of the particularly rough weather, a lot of places were in hampered field collection efforts to drive revenue. But with a combination of the backlog and particularly a strong cycle starting in the state of Indiana this year. It should be up, kind of mid-single digits for the year.
Operator: The next question comes from Matt Williams of Evercore.
Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Maybe just one for me. But I'm curious, just if you could provide any color around sort of the backlog or how the demand pipeline looks around Munis and EnerGov. It seems like customers are a little more engaged around maybe deploying those 2 solutions together. So I was just curious about sort of what the outlook is there on that side of the business, and sort of why customers may be coming around to tying the 2 solutions together and going with joint deployments a little bit more going forward?
John S. Marr: Yes, that's going well. We had applications with that functionality within Tyler, but we wouldn't necessarily call them industry leading. And acquiring EnerGov was about having an industry-leading solution in that space. There are small growing -- they were a small growing company, they are now a small growing division of Tyler. They are focused on kind of point solutions, decisions that are exclusively around those applications, when I say they, the division itself, and they're winning direct deals on that basis, and really creating the volume of business that they can be responsive to. And the revenue synergies do come from, including those applications with Munis, as well as Incode in the marketplace, and we've had good success with that and driven incremental business for that division that's mostly handled from the Munis and Incode channels, both sales and service. So that's exactly what we wanted to see happen there. The other thing that's hard to measure, but we know is happening is, when you have a 3-day demonstration for a major city or county and half a day of it was related to those applications, instead of that being something that we kind of survived with our earlier applications, it's now something that strengthens our overall competitive position. So again, you'll never know the deal you won that you may not have, but along with driving additional EnerGov revenues, we do believe that it's improving our competitive positions with the other applications. So we're pleased with all of that.
Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: And maybe just 1 quick follow-up on the e-filing opportunity. It seems like the most significant opportunity is obviously when states mandate e-filing. And I'm wondering if you could just provide a little bit of color on sort of what the interest level is or what sort of the holdups might be for particular states to actually mandate e-filing rather than just making it an option?
John S. Marr: Well, it's ...
Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: I realize that's probably a difficult question to answer.
John S. Marr: Yes, it is. I may guess the biggest observation, and it is just interesting that so many of these states continue to have so much manual filing, and I think all of us that are exposed to technology would look at that and be convinced that it's just not reasonable to think that a significant amount of the filing will continue to be manual, 3, 5, 8, 10 years from now. So we are convinced that what's going on in Texas and what's going on in other states we're involved in, will be adopted around the country. We see a lot of states and major counties following and watching and communicating with places like Texas and other jurisdictions where e-file has been successful. And we're convinced that most of the country will move in that direction, and we feel we're in a great position to capitalize on that. We have a tremendous amount of activity going on right now, installing case management systems, as well as the awards and the market that we've talked about on this call, and previously, and most of those have the expectation that e-file will follow. It's not always contractual, we don't think it's necessary -- it's not necessary to put that barrier up in closing the original deal. It's the customer's expectation and ours that once the case management systems are in place that the logical follow on will be to put e-file in front of it.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Josh Goldberg of G2 Investments Partners.
Josh Goldberg - G2 Investment Partners Management LLC: I had a couple of quick questions. First, I know you talked a little about your back half of the year being stronger both in bookings and revenue. Obviously, your -- midpoint of your revised revenue guidance would imply roughly about $120 million of revenue per quarter for the next 3 quarters. I know probably you might start a little slower and then ramp up as the year goes on. But could you help us understand where that incremental $8 million is coming from. Is it coming from subscriptions and licenses, or just across the board? And I'll follow up.
Brian K. Miller: The license -- licenses are relatively high really for the first quarter. And so we wouldn't expect to see that number dramatically higher throughout the year but relatively constant, kind of that level. Subscriptions will continue to grow throughout the year would be our expectation. As well as professional services, there's been a lot of onboarding as I indicated earlier in financials. Those people are now becoming available to projects. Then in the second half of the year, we'll see some of that as well in the Courts & Justice side. So we will see some growth there as well. And maintenance will grow marginally as it always does throughout the year. So less in licenses, more in the recurrings and professional services.
Josh Goldberg - G2 Investment Partners Management LLC: Okay. And with that case, it would also seem like your earnings will grow much higher than where they are in Q1. If the mix shifts to more of these services contracts or revenue, that would not show as much earnings for us. I'm just wondering what gives you the confidence on the earnings side to get to the $183 million to $190 million.
Brian K. Miller: Well it's true that the margins on professional services are lower than licenses in the recurring lines. However, as I indicated, we've had a high level of onboarding, so these are resources that are on the payroll, they were investing in otherwise as well, that are not yet productive from a revenue standpoint. And as we go into the second half of the year some of those resources will become revenue-productive. So as the revenues grow, the leverage in many areas of our business, the SG&A level, certainly in the help desk and in the development side, so we would continue to expect to see some margin expansion later in the year.
Josh Goldberg - G2 Investment Partners Management LLC: Okay. And then just regards to the bookings level, you mentioned that you think June will be a strong bookings level. Just for reference, since you didn't have the number, it was roughly $147 million in the June quarter. And in each of last few quarters, you've grown your bookings over $40 million from the first quarter into the second quarter, a couple of years back you actually grew it over $60 million. It seems like the second quarter usually has a very strong bookings level to it. Does that feel right to you that the second quarter usually has a very strong bookings level, might be one of the strongest for the year even, as you look back? Or looking forward.
Brian K. Miller: There are lot of variables that go around, as John mentioned earlier, what specific quarter contracts fall in. Last year, in Q2, we did have a very large deal with New York City for property tax side. And so that was one of the things that pushed Q2 up last year. I think we clearly expect that the second half of the year end will be very strong in terms of new bookings and the significant amount of those will fall in Q2. But I don't think we can give specific bookings guidance with respect to any particular quarter.
John S. Marr: And maintenance was normal in Q2 as well. So that's one of the reasons too.
Operator: At this time, there appear to be no more questions. We do have a question now, a follow-up from Raghavan Sarathy from Dougherty & Company.
Raghavan Sarathy - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division: So in terms of the California superior court, the case management system, you talked about a number of awards, but in general, you see -- what's, so I'm sort of wondering, what's driving these courts to make a decision by the June end. And what sort of expectation you have that 50 superior courts, it seems like there's a pickup in activity, do you see most of the courts making decision by the end of this year?
John S. Marr: There are some funding considerations as far as we understand that required that they make decisions, and have some projects underway by the end of June. Now I think only the courts that are close to making decisions have been engaged in a process will use that as a sense of urgency to get something done. And that is not the majority of courts. But I think a number of courts that are well into their process of making an evaluation will use that as a reason to make an award, get a contract in place, and get underway. So we would expect that there would be a reasonable number of decisions. I'd just rather not characterize that, because it's hard. We don't control that, but we expect that there will be a number of contracts that are a result of that. Subsequent to that, it's possible that those that were close used it as a reason to make a decision and get underway, and it might slow down a little bit for some time, and that would be fine. At that point, we will have, as you know, we have 13 contracted awards at this point, and that number, we expect to grow, somewhat meaningfully in the second quarter. We will have a lot of projects underway, and a lot of business there. But whether that's maybe half of the total number of counties, could be somewhere in that area, and I certainly wouldn't expect the other half to make decisions in the second half of the year. So by the end of this year, it could be 50% or 60% of the total number of courts, that might be a reasonable expectation. I don't think it would be much more than that.
Operator: Mr. Marr, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.
John S. Marr: Okay, thank you Andrew. And thank you all for joining us on the call today. If you have any further questions, feel free to contact Brian Miller or myself. Have a great day.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. You may disconnect your line. Thank you.

Operator: Hello, and welcome to today's Tyler Technologies Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2013 Conference Call. Your host for today's call is John Marr, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded today, February 6, 2014. I would like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Marr. Please go ahead.
John S. Marr: Thank you, Jamie, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2013 earnings call. With me on the call today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like for Brian to give the Safe Harbor statement. Next, I'll have some preliminary comments, and Brian will give the details of our fourth quarter operating results and 2014 guidance. Then, I'll have some final comments, and we'll take your questions. Brian?
Brian K. Miller: Thanks, John. During the course of this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information and may include projections concerning the company's future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. John?
John S. Marr: Our fourth quarter represented a strong finish to a year of record performance by almost any measure. This was our 12th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth, as well as our 51st consecutive profitable quarter. Our recurring revenues from subscriptions and maintenance continue to be major drivers of our growth, as together, they grew 19% and represented approximately 62% of total revenue for the quarter. Our subscription revenue growth of 51% reflects a continued shift toward cloud-based Software-as-a-Service business, as well as strong growth in our e-file solutions for courts, including the first full quarter of revenue from our Texas e-file contract. We're particularly pleased to have software licenses and royalty revenues grow 27% over the year even as subscription revenues were strong. Our software license revenues of $11 million were our highest quarterly license revenues since the fourth quarter of 2009. The fact that we achieved greater than 20% growth in both software licenses and subscription revenues underscores how remarkably strong the quarter was. Gross margins improved 90 basis points to 47.7%, reflecting our operating leverage in incremental recurring revenue, including the Texas e-filing contract, as well as the higher level of software licenses. New contract signings continue to be very solid across all of our major products. Some of the notable contract signings in the quarter were an agreement with the city of Columbia, Missouri for our Munis ERP solution and our EnerGov planning, permitting and licensing solutions valued at approximately $4.8 million. This contract is a great example of the value added from the integration of our EnerGov acquisition in 2012, of those applications contributed meaningful amount of the total value in Columbia. We also signed significant contracts for our ERP solutions with El Paso County, Texas and Pasco County, Florida, each valued at more than $4 million. The Boston Public Schools signed a contract for Tyler Incident Management, an application that integrates with Tyler's Versatrans transportation software suite, providing the district with a complete school transportation management solution. Also, the state of Oklahoma Office of Management and Enterprise Services named Tyler as a preferred vendor for Tyler's student information systems. Oklahoma school districts can purchase Tyler SIS at a negotiated rate from the state contract without conducting their own request for proposal process. We also continue to have success in the courts market with our Odyssey case management solution. In California, we signed a contract with Fresno County Superior Court for Odyssey, which will also include e-filing. Also in California, 6 other Superior Courts collaborated an agreement to jointly implement our Odyssey case management solution as a single project rather than 6 individual projects. This unique initiative, officially known as the NorCal Collaboration Project, is a product of the Superior Courts of Alpine, Calaveras, Glenn, Lassen, Tehama and Yuba counties. The initiative is a 5-year SaaS arrangement and was signed under the Master Service Arrangement. The 6 courts will have a total of approximately 200 users on the Odyssey system. In addition, the New Hampshire Judicial Branch, which uses our Odyssey case management system statewide, selected our e-file solution and other additional Odyssey features for their statewide e-Court initiative. Now I'd like for Brian to provide more details on the results of the quarter and give our annual guidance for 2014.
Brian K. Miller: Thanks, John. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its preliminary results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2013. These results are considered unaudited until our Form 10-K is filed, which is expected to be on February 20. I'm going to provide some additional data on this quarter's performance and our guidance, and then I'll turn the call back over to John for his additional comments. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. Our non-GAAP earnings exclude share-based compensation expense, the employer portion of payroll taxes on employee stock transactions and amortization of acquired intangibles. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. Revenues for the fourth quarter were $110.7 million, a new quarterly high, up 16.1%. Organic revenue growth was 14.0%, and EnerGov, acquired in November 2012, accounted for 2.1 percentage points of growth. Software license and royalty revenues increased 27.4%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, software licenses and royalties grew 20.3%, which is attributable to the increase in Tyler proprietary license sales to new customers, as well as growth in Microsoft Dynamics royalties. Software licenses grew more than 25% to $11 million. In Q4, we received $473,000 of royalties on public sector sales of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 by other Microsoft partners, almost double the $238,000 in royalties a year ago. In addition, we had approximately $1.1 million of revenues related to Tyler's direct sales of Dynamics, which are included in software license services, maintenance and subscription revenues. Subscriptions continue to be our fastest-growing revenue line and grew 51.3%, all of which -- all of -- of which all but 0.8% was organic. We added 26 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 15 existing installed clients compared to a total of 29 new arrangements and 15 conversions in the fourth quarter of 2012. The average contract value of the new subscription contracts in Q4 was significantly higher than last year, and the total value of the new subscription contracts in Q4 was 27% higher than last year. Approximately 26% of our new software clients opted for one of our cloud-based solutions compared to 45% of the new clients in the fourth quarter of 2012. The subscription line also includes a growing revenue stream from e-filing for courts and online payments. These revenues rose approximately 121% to $6.7 million from $3.0 million last year. Included in subscription revenues this quarter was approximately $3.1 million related to our Texas e-filing contract. Excluding the revenue from the Texas e-filing contract, subscriptions rose approximately 27%. We expect to continue to see long-term growth in these revenues as both current and new clients adopt our Odyssey File & Serve solution and more of them move towards mandatory e-filing. Software services revenues increased 13.4% with 10.0% organic and 3.4% from acquisitions. Maintenance revenue growth was 9.3%, of which 8.2% was organic. Our maintenance revenue growth continues to be reduced somewhat by the increasing percentage of new SaaS clients, as well as the effect of existing installed clients converting to our hosted offerings, which results in a loss of maintenance revenue offset by a larger increase in subscription revenue. Our blended gross margin for the quarter was 47.7% compared to 46.8%. The increase reflects the higher level of license and royalty revenues, as well as improved margins in our subscription revenues with the leverage from e-filing growth. SG&A expense increased 14.6% in the quarter, with the majority of the increase from higher noncash share-based compensation expense. SG&A expense was 23.6% of total revenues, a decrease of 30 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. Noncash share-based compensation expense was $3.1 million compared to $1.9 million. $422,000 was included in the cost of revenues and $2.7 million was included in the SG&A expense. Excluding noncash share-based compensation expense and the employer portion of payroll taxes on employee stock transactions, SG&A expense was 20.7% of revenues compared to 22.0% last year. Operating income was $19.5 million compared to $15.4 million, an increase of 26.2%. Non-GAAP operating income was $24.7 million, up 28.9%. The non-GAAP operating margin improved 220 basis points to 22.3%. Net income was $10.5 million or $0.30 per diluted share compared to $9.4 million or $0.28 per diluted share. The fully diluted share count increased by approximately 1.9 million shares as a result of stock option exercises and our higher stock price. Our effective tax rate in Q4 was 44.9% as we cumulatively adjusted the annual rate to 40.6% from the 38.9% rate we were estimating through Q3. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily because of the tax implications of the high level of stock option exercises by employees in the quarter, as those have a negative impact on certain tax deductions and therefore, our rate. This factor is difficult to predict and can result in some volatility in our tax rate, as we saw this quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $14.0 million or $0.39 per diluted share compared to $11.9 million or $0.36 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2012. Adjusted EBITDA, which is EBITDA plus noncash share-based compensation expense, was $26 million or $0.74 per diluted share, an increase of 27.9% compared to $20.3 million or $0.61 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2012. Free cash flow was $793,000 compared to $13.7 million. Excluding real estate CapEx, our free cash flow was $5.9 million versus $14.9 million. The decrease is primarily attributable to the timing of billings related to contract milestones. Days sales outstanding and accounts receivable was 87 days at December 31, 2013, compared to 95 days a year ago. DSOs increased sequentially from 76 days at September 30, which is our normal trend, as we bill a significant portion of our maintenance in Q4 resulting in an increase in receivables with the related revenue deferred over the next 12 months. Our backlog at the end of the quarter reached a new high at $551.7 million, up 45%. Backlog related to our Software business, which excludes backlog from appraisal services contracts, was $531.8 million, a 51.7% increase. Backlog included $136.7 million of maintenance compared to $125.5 million a year ago. Subscription backlog was $188.7 million compared to $82.1 million last year and included approximately $68.3 million related to the Texas e-filing contract. Our bookings for the quarter, which are calculated from the change in backlog plus revenues, were up 2.9% to $121 million. For the 12 months ended December 31, bookings were up approximately 45% over the prior 12-month period, including the Texas e-filing contract, which contributed $71.5 million of bookings in the third quarter. We signed 34 new contracts in the fourth quarter that included software licenses greater than $100,000, and those contracts had an average license of $531,000, compared to 18 new contracts with an average license value of $493,000 in the fourth quarter of 2012. Our total headcount grew by 91 to 2,573 employees at the end of the fourth quarter compared to 2,482 at the end of the third quarter, mainly professional services people and development staff to ensure that we are well positioned to deliver our current backlog and anticipated new business. Turning to 2014, our initial annual guidance is as follows. We currently expect 2014 revenues to be between $467 million and $475 million. We expect 2014 diluted GAAP EPS to be approximately $1.31 to $1.37, and fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be approximately 36 million to 37 million shares. We expect 2014 non-GAAP diluted EPS to be approximately $1.76 to $1.85. For the year, estimated noncash share-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $15 million. We expect an effective tax rate for 2014 of approximately 39% to 41% based on the timing and volume of stock option transactions throughout the year. We expect our total capital expenditures will be approximately $12 million to $13 million for the year. Total depreciation and amortization is expected to be between $15 million and $15.5 million, including approximately $6.5 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. And now I'd like to turn the call back over to John for his further comments.
John S. Marr: Thanks, Brian. As we indicated, Q4 was a solid quarter financially, generally in line with our expectations and capping a very good year. We're extremely pleased with the level of bookings in the quarter, which have been at a consistently high level for the last 3 quarters. The dollar value of new contracts, including both traditional license deals and cloud deals, increased significantly over last year and, as a result, backlog continued to expand. I believe this performance is reflective of both the broader market recovery to pre-recession activity levels and Tyler's very strong competitive position. Our consistent investment in our products and our track record of successfully executing complex projects are important factors in our success in the new business market and enhance our ability to continue to gain market share and build on our leadership position. As we noted earlier on the call, although our average deal size for both license and cloud contracts increased over last year, our new business success this quarter was not driven by extremely large contracts but by higher win rates, especially in the mid and the upper-mid market opportunities. Our wins were also very geographically dispersed and spread across all our major product groups. While revenue growth in the mid-teens for 2013, and the same forecasted for 2014, is an increase over recent history, it doesn't fully reflect the improvement we are experiencing in the new business market. As you know, roughly 2/3 of our revenues are recurring. It takes a multiple of that overall growth rate in the mid-teens and new business to drive those results. We're encouraged by the demand we have seen for our products in 2013, and we believe we are bringing more activity into the new year than was the case last year. The courts market is a sub-vertical in which we have become a pretty clear leader. We further expanded our early success in the California market with new contracts this quarter in Fresno County and with a group of 6 counties known as the NorCal Collaboration Project. To date, we have been selected in 12 of the 14 California courts that have signed contracts for new court case management systems. The losses were to 2 different companies, so no other company has won more than a single deal. We have a number of very active ongoing sales processes in the state and are confident of our ability to continue to win new business while successfully executing on those implementations. We achieved a major milestone in early January when our first California Odyssey implementation in San Luis Obispo County went live, just 13 months after the project was kicked off. In our courts e-filing business, it was also a very busy quarter. We had a full quarter of revenue from the e-file Texas contract, which was converted from a per-transaction model to a fixed-price arrangement in October. Operationally, we consider this start-up to be an unqualified success. On January 1, 2014, e-filing became mandatory in courts in the state's 10 largest counties, with a significant jump in the volume of users and filings. The planning and effort leading up to January 1 by a very large team of Tyler professionals, as well as client personnel, was incredibly challenging, but I'm pleased to report that the team rose to the challenge and executed very well. As of today, e-file Texas has more than 51,000 registered users in the legal community and is processing more than 11,000 daily filings compared to approximately 4,400 filings in December. Last Friday, we hosted a joint press briefing on e-file Texas with representatives of the Texas Administrative Office of the Courts and the state Supreme Court, including Chief Justice Nathan Hecht, and it's fair to say that they are pleased with the performance of the first month of operation. We are continuing to bring new counties live on the system. E-filing will become mandatory in 12 additional Texas counties on July 1. We are also pursuing a number of additional e-filing opportunities with current Odyssey clients, as well as with courts that do not use Odyssey. While we incur costs ahead of revenues with each of these new e-filing contracts, which may put short-term pressure on margins, we believe that these recurring e-filing revenue streams will contribute significantly to long-term revenue and margin expansion in the coming years. With respect to the Microsoft Dynamics AX, as we mentioned earlier in the call, our royalty revenues from Microsoft this quarter were approximately doubled from last year's fourth quarter but declined sequentially from the third quarter. For the full year, our royalties from Microsoft totaled $3.1 million, more than quadruple the 2012 royalties of $756,000. The 2013 royalties were generated by sales of Dynamics AX to approximately 114 public sector entities in 38 different countries. This was also -- this was only our eighth quarter of royalties and we have almost no visibility into the reseller pipeline. We are encouraged that the progress is across a very broad marketplace and is reflected by the diversity of the wins geographically and the types of entities. We expect that the royalty revenues may be somewhat lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, which represents both a risk and an opportunity in our short-term results. In our direct sales channel for Dynamics, we announced one new contract during the quarter, which was signed late in the third quarter with the Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority of Austin, Texas. Capital Metropolitan Authority of Austin is a regional public transportation provider since 1985, with 3,000 bus stops throughout Central Texas. The contract is valued at approximately $1.9 million. Brian discussed our specific guidance for 2014 earlier in the call. With our high level of backlog and more than 60% from recurring revenues, we clearly have a high level of visibility as we build our plan for next year. Having said that, our initial guidance for revenues and earnings typically encompass a fairly wide range, which is intended to account for, among other things, uncertainties in the mix of new business between our license and cloud models, as well as uncertainties over the timing of revenue recognition based on the terms in the new contracts. In addition, as we mentioned earlier, our tax rate may be somewhat more volatile than usual this year, and our diluted share count depends on both the level and timing of option exercises, as well as our stock price, which is not in our control. So I'm pleased with our results for 2013, clearly the best year we have had since before our market was impacted by the broader economic conditions in late 2008. And I'm particularly pleased that the higher end of our guidance for 2014 represents even stronger organic revenue growth. Tyler continues to grow revenues and expand margins even as we invest in our products and service offerings, as well as transition from a traditional on-premise software company to more of a subscription-based SaaS or cloud company. It's a lot to juggle, and I want to express my appreciation to the more than 2,500 Tyler professionals who continue to execute at a high level that separates our results from others in the marketplace. Now, Jamie, we'd be happy to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Charlie Strauzer from CJS Securities.
Charles Strauzer - CJS Securities, Inc.: Quick question for you. When you look at the guidance versus backlog, your backlog is up pretty nicely here, and when you look at your guidance, can you talk just more about how much of the guidance you have kind of in-hand versus the backlog? And then also, what assumption should we bake in for R&D for this year?
Brian K. Miller: Charlie, backlog, obviously, is up significantly, but there clearly is more long-term backlog, things from subscription-based arrangements, which can go out as long as 7 years. TexFile was a 4-year arrangement that went into backlog and will come out over a 4-year period. So the current portion of backlog, while the absolute dollars is higher, the percentage is quite a bit lower than in prior years. So I think that the percentage of our backlog expected to be delivered in the next 12 months this year is around 56% versus last year, closer to 70%. So longer-term in nature, but obviously, all the recurring revenues are pretty well set in the backlog, and a meaningful portion of our software and services backlog, particularly the courts and tax business, which is almost all percentage of completion accounting, for the most part, is in backlog as well. So fairly high visibility in terms of what's coming out of backlog, but as John mentioned, some uncertainty over the timing and the revenue recognition on -- and the model in which new contracts will be delivered helps lead to that wider range of initial guidance. With respect to R&D, I think R&D will be up in the mid- to high-single digits in 2014 compared to 2013. So we started to see leverage there. Although the absolute dollar spend is up as a percentage of revenue, it's coming down. As you know, we've significantly increased our spend in R&D over the last few years, part of that related to the Dynamics project and part of it related to other Tyler products, and we do believe that we'll see leverage in that line going forward and hold the growth in R&D below our overall revenue growth.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Berg from Northland Capital Markets.
Scott R. Berg - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division: First, housekeeping, Brian. What was the percentage of deals in the quarter that went cloud or subscription versus license? I didn't catch it.
Brian K. Miller: In terms of the number of deals, I believe it was 26%.
Scott R. Berg - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division: Great. That's a little bit lower than the last couple, which is fine, obviously reflective in the strong license numbers, but what are your expectations on how that could kind of fare it out in 2014? Do you think that changes meaningfully from the 25% to 30% range that we've been in '13, or does it stay consistent?
John S. Marr: It doesn't seem to be changing rapidly. I think it kind of doubled from 12%, 15% up into the range it's now. And I think some of that was reflective of the economics in local government, that it wasn't always so much a technical decision as signing up for a subscription rather than having a capital event. And it seems to have stabilized there. So at the moment, it seems to be stable in that range.
Scott R. Berg - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division: Great. On the -- then on the Microsoft royalties, we went into the year thinking $3 million would be a good, strong year for that business, and that's what you ended up reporting, which is a great year-over-year, obviously, increase. But can you talk about expectations moving into next year? Obviously, we're expecting something more, but does that get comprised of maybe more existing customers upgrading to the platform, or is that delta more a reflection of, say, new customers that Microsoft ends up selling to?
John S. Marr: Well, I guess there's 2 reasons we have the least amount of visibility around that. One is that, obviously, we don't -- it's not a mature business so virtually none of it is recurring in nature the way our more mature units are. So we start with very little and rely mostly on the new business market, so it's hard to know that. And then secondly, obviously, other than our direct sales, it's coming from their channel, which we don't control and again, get very little visibility. So I agree with you. We have obviously put some increases in our plan for it. This particular quarter wasn't particularly strong, and we'll kind of see how it rolls out. The product shows well. It's well received. Probably most importantly, our projects that we're implementing are going well and are referenceable, and so we remain enthusiastic about it being a catalyst for growth and contribution down the road. But in the short term, as we said in our remarks, it's really hard to tell. If we were to get some big deals directly or the reports from them are favorable, then it could be upside, and it could be some exposure on the downside, although I think we've been cautious in what we put in our plan.
Scott R. Berg - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division: Great. And then lastly, for me, John, can you comment on overall product demand relative to pipelines that you're seeing today versus maybe early in January or February of 2013? You've added some sales headcount over the last year to add distribution capacity. Any, maybe, sense on directionally, percentage-wise, where you're seeing an increase, I guess, in pipelines?
John S. Marr: Yes. I mean, the reality is, as I said as well, the market today is better. Our backlog's better. Awards that are being negotiated toward contracts is better. All of those indications are better today than they were going into last year. Now last year, things accelerated pretty significantly in the summer, if you remember, and we didn't know. Was that deferred decisions? Was it kind of a catch-up? And the good news is that activity seemed to continue right through the fall and into the holidays, and so it seems to be sustaining itself. So the demand in the end market has stayed relatively strong since last summer. It's not stronger than it was in the summer and through the rest of the year, but it's staying in that range, which means that it is considerably stronger right now as we sit here in January than it was last year. Last year, awards in the first quarter were not particularly strong, and revenues recognized on licenses were not particularly strong, and they improved throughout the year. So we're starting the year in a better position. And obviously, we'll see, as the year progresses, if that sustains itself.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Kinstlinger from Sidoti & Company.
Brian Kinstlinger - Sidoti & Company, LLC: The -- can you remind us for the large Odyssey implementations, say, the potentially large ones that are coming down the pike in California, how long will it take from signing until it's implemented? And what I'm trying to get at is, how long before it drives the maintenance revenues up, and therefore, profitability in that division would be stronger?
John S. Marr: Well, maintenance generally starts before they're fully implemented. So whether the customer pays it or whether it's carved out of a license fee, generally, we will start to recognize maintenance revenues ahead of a, say, go-live or something -- some later event. So we'll see maintenance shortly after, not necessarily award of a contract, but the original implementation on those. A lot of the deals so far have been small or mid-size courts. It seemed to be where there was urgency, as well as the projects are simply -- the scope of them are smaller and they can act more quickly. There certainly are larger counties that we're talking to that certainly could become projects. As we move forward, they'll be multi-year engagements. Some of the biggest counties would be more analogous to some of the statewide deals that we've done. So they'd be multi-year, long-term contracts, but again, generally, maintenance will be recognized earlier in the project and not necessarily when they go live.
Brian Kinstlinger - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Great. And my follow-up. You mentioned single-digit R&D increases in total dollars and with the development of Dynamics behind, and I'm not sure that you have -- other than upgrading and doing the maintenance internally for yourself to upgrade products, where is the increased R&D dollars being deployed right now?
John S. Marr: Well, it would not be in Dynamics, that's right. So Dynamics basically is a spend or a headcount that is stable. And until something changed in the marketplace, there was a broader opportunity, we would expect that our investment, from an R&D standpoint, in Dynamics has kind of peaked or actually slid back a little bit from its peak, once released, but we will maintain it at that level. So the R&D spend increase is in our own proprietary products and it's somewhat across the board. Certainly, we're investing in the EnerGov products that we acquired. We believe there's a lot of potential there. So that would be maybe higher than other areas. The LGD [ph] products, we're investing in those products to really broaden the market footprint into schools and in areas where they didn't have as much a presence historically, and certainly in the Munis and Odyssey products as well.
Brian K. Miller: And, Brian, half of that, if you assume, say, something like an 8% increase in R&D spend, half of that is just going to be the same headcount but salary increases and the fringes that go with that, so you get a 3% or 4% increase just with the same people.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Ho from William Blair & Company.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: My first question is around the bookings activity. I mean it seems like the fourth quarter is typically very strong in terms of maintenance renewals, were there any large deals that slipped from Q4 to Q1 or any sort of surprises around the deal closure activity around the quarter or did things sort of come in the way you expected?
John S. Marr: There aren't, as we said, any kind of megadeals, these very, very large deals. So that's where, I think, the increase, at all, is a good sign, when you don't have some statewide Odyssey deal or a very, very large deal, but we see a strong number there and an increase that's really made up of a lot of just good solid deals. There also isn't any megadeal that we're carrying into Q1 that was awarded but not contracted, but as I indicated earlier, the awards, in general, that we carry into the year that aren't contracted and aren't in backlog, is a considerably higher level than what we brought into this year. So there's pretty good activity, quite a few awards but they're -- as we indicated, we have -- there are no megadeals, but we're doing more in kind of, I guess, what Gartner refers to as the Tier 2 space. So not the biggest cities and counties in the country, but that next tier down, that are $1 million to $5 million deals for us. That's really where we've seen the most growth. So if you look at the number of names compared to the increases in the dollars, that's coming from that segment.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Yes, just building on that, could you talk a little bit about -- I know you said that the win rate has continued to improve but I just wanted to get a sense for, maybe, segment-by-segment what you're seeing from the high end to the low end of the market and just whether there's further separation from competitors in each of those areas.
John S. Marr: Well, kind of -- we've been referring to -- we're obviously a vertical market software company. So everything we're doing is public sector, predominantly domestic and it all has a vertical orientation. However, parts of that market, we see crossover vendors, right, so financial systems, human capital management, we're going to see companies that play in other verticals, as well as in the horizontal commercial markets. And in there, you're always going to have stronger competitors, even though we've improved our competitive position. And what we refer to as the sub-verticals, nobody crosses over into a court system, you're only going to compete with software that's been very specifically developed for courts. The same is true with tax and appraisal, maybe even our transportation offering in schools. And those are areas where our leadership position has been extended because, quite frankly, Tyler is a bigger, stronger company that can consistently invest in those products at a level that these smaller independent companies have struggled to do through the volatility in the marketplace. So I think our separation is greater or more pronounced in the sub-verticals than the segment of the market that we can see crossover players on and that would be I think up and down the scale. In the broader market where we see crossover vendors and more consistent competition, I think the improvement, as I indicated a moment ago, is in that Tier 2, maybe Tier 3 space somewhat. So the number of deals that are $600,000 to $800,000 in licenses, $1.5 million, $2 million total contract value, a couple hundred thousand dollars of recurring revenue, post-implementation, really good business for us, that's the space where we have seen the most improvement in the competitive position and the best level of growth.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Got it. And just one final question. As you look at TexFile and e-filing, in general, become a larger portion of the mix, could you maybe talk about how this impacts the model? It seems like a lot of the investments in spending were made upfront for TexFile. Just wanted to understand the leverage components a little bit and how you think about that.
John S. Marr: Yes, e-file Texas. Yes, that's right. This past year we've, obviously, had the revenues in the fourth quarter, which was nice to see. But we invested not only in the product but in the service channel that we had to build to manage the calls and the activity. As we indicated, there's over 50,000 users registered on the system now, virtually all of them are relatively new users. So the service deliverable, we wanted to be very well prepared for and, if anything, over-prepared for. So the staffing to be responsive to that was significant and those costs are in our structure. As we indicated as well in the prepared comments, these other deals we're pursuing and preparing for all have requirements, sales requirements, service requirements and product requirements that we'll be investing in ahead of revenues. But I think to some degree, we do have a critical mass structure in place on the dev team and, as these users, registered users, become more experienced, those call volumes will stabilize and eventually fall, and some of that infrastructure can be redeployed or reused on the other deals that we're working. So there'll be new headcount but we feel that, that division, even though it's our fastest growing division, headcount, actually, will start to stabilize and grow at a rate well below its revenue growth.
Operator: Our next question comes from Raghavan Sarathy from Dougherty & Company.
Raghavan Sarathy - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division: I want to get some specifics around this Texas e-filing project. So I think, Brian, you mentioned there was $3.1 million of revenue from Texas e-filing in the fourth quarter. Can you update us on the rollout of the project, what is your expectation in revenue and margin for this year and next year?
Brian K. Miller: Yes, from a revenue standpoint, it's a fixed-price contract, so we know what the revenues will be. For the full year of 2014, it's about just under $17 million and it starts ramping up from where we were in Q4 to roughly $3.9 million in the first quarter, a little less than $4 million in the second and then up to $4.3 million and $4.8 million. So those are the revenue expectations. And then, looking out even a year further for the year 2015, that the revenues from that contract are just a little over $19 million. We haven't specifically talked about margins on that individual contract and we typically don't. We would expect to see, obviously, better margins and contribution this year that's built into our plan, as we generate this higher level of revenues and a lot of the upfront costs are behind us. But in this year, 2014, we do have -- as we said, we went live with the 10 largest counties on a mandatory basis January 1, as far as e-filing, but there are many more counties than that, that are actually already using this system, just not on a mandatory basis, and we will continue to bring new counties on to the system, implement them, do the setup efforts and support them, and then, I think there's another 12 counties that become mandatory July 1, and there's another group at the end of the year. So there are additional start-up costs, if you will, associated with bringing these additional counties online throughout the year, not at the same level as the push we had last year to do the initial start-up. So we will see -- we would expect on that contract to have further improvement in margins next year, over 2014, but certainly, margins that are above our blended margins on this contract in '14.
Raghavan Sarathy - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division: All right. And then, my second question is around this California court case management system opportunities. I know that now you've become the largest vendor, you closed a number of smaller deals, any thoughts on some of the bigger counties, where they are in terms sort of looking at the replacement opportunities, and I have a follow-up.
John S. Marr: Well, we obviously won't be commenting on specific opportunities that are competitive at this point in time. But as I said earlier, I think that the fact that a lot of the early deals are smaller to mid-sized counties is reflective of the fact that there's more urgency there. It's harder for them to solve their own problems, they don't have the resources to do that, so they're going to look to a partner more quickly. And the scope of the projects themselves are more limited and so their ability to organize a project, make a decision and move forward can happen more quickly. It is not reflective of the fact that there isn't demand in the higher end of the market; there is. So we believe that and we're engaged in discussions with a number of the larger counties that would resemble other large county deals we've done around the country and, in some cases, those deals could resemble some of the statewide deals we've done. And you know the cities and counties that are large in the state, and they're big courts and they'll be big projects. But their ability to define the scope of the project, issue a document, and us to be responsive and work on statements of work and plan the project appropriately, it's a big project. So it'll take time before they can hit go, and even when they do, it'll take time, obviously, to get started and execute the project and, eventually, recognize maintenance and e-file revenues. But it's certainly a significant long-term opportunity. The fundamentals of those deals are good and that we'd expect most of them would have healthy recurring revenues both from maintenance and e-file, and the dual recurring revenue model is an improvement over our other businesses that are less mature that rely on a single recurring revenue model. So again, it's not something that'll explode over the next quarter or 2, but we do expect that the larger counties will participate in what we're seeing currently in the lower end now.
Raghavan Sarathy - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division: All right. And then, one final question on sort of the deal mix in the last quarter. So, John, you mentioned that the new business was strong across mid-market, not very many large contracts. But I looked at the metrics, seems like the metrics are better year-over-year, 34 new contracts, ASP was $531,000, versus 18 and roughly $500,000. So try to reconcile the metrics with the commentary you provided.
John S. Marr: Yes. Again, it's happening in what we kind of call the Tier 2 space, so lots of what are on the higher end of the range for us, but not the outsized deals. So that's all we're saying. Obviously, to have a good quarter, to have growth in the bookings and to expand backlog without a megadeal is encouraging. We will see large deals, as I just indicated, in courts and in other areas, but they don't happen every quarter. So you're exactly right, that doing quite a few deals in that Tier 2 space, which are $1 million, $3 million, $5 million kind of deals is encouraging. That's a very good spot for us in the marketplace and, obviously, in quarters where we have that experience, as well as a statewide deal or a very large county deal, then that's where you'll see the bookings and the backlog spike a little bit. But to have a quarter where you didn't have an outsized deal and to make that progress, to us, is actually encouraging.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Schappel from Benchmark.
Mark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division: John, with respect to your New Hampshire court deal. Does the State of New Hampshire have a mandatory e-filing initiative?
John S. Marr: I do not believe it's mandatory at this point.
Mark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division: And with respect to your courts business, I mean, who are you competing with these days, there? I mean, is MCAD getting active in this space yet or Justice Systems?
John S. Marr: Well, MCAD has not won either of the deals in California, and I don't believe has won a significant deal that we'd consider a loss in a large county or statewide deal in a number of years. We certainly don't want to take the market for granted, but right now, we really haven't been losing meaningful deals, large counties, statewide or otherwise types of deals. So as we said, the 2 deals we lost in California were to 2 different players, we believe both on price, and there's 3 or 4 people we're competing with, but no one of them, in our view, has been successful in multiple deals over the last few years. So we don't want to take that for granted, but we're investing in the product, continuing to try to put some space between us and the competition and, quite frankly, very focused on executing on the higher level of business we've been awarded.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt Williams from Evercore.
Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Just have one in particular on the NorCal Courts & Justice, their court case management deal, was that a situation where the counties themselves sort of got together ahead of time and said, "Why don't we go ahead and work together on this?" Or is that -- was that something where you guys sort of helped facilitate that? And I guess, longer-term, in the absence of megadeals in that state, is there other opportunities, either for you guys to lead that process or for other counties to really sort of try and follow the same lead there?
John S. Marr: Yes, kind of all of the above, it was kind of an evolution. I think one of these counties has 3 judges, maybe. Some of them are very small and it would have been a challenge to implement Odyssey and scale it down to that level. So hosting it and having the ability to not implement it 6 different times made us more efficient in collaborating on business practices and sharing services and the like, was a mutual thing that I think we pursued together. I think it has been watched by other counties. I'm not sure there'll be a 6-county collaboration but it is possible that other counties, whether we host an instance that supports multiple counties or whether we just collaborate on business practices and shared services, that has been watched and that is being considered or investigated in other counties as well.
Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up on sort of the other side of the Courts & Justice business, but now that Texas and e-filing is up and running, especially in the top 10 counties there, I would assume there are other states that are starting to, I guess, maybe, look at Texas as a reference point. Has that helped in terms of trying to go out to other states or other large counties and say, "This is what we've done here, this is kind of how it's gone." I'm just trying to get a sense of what the level of interest is now that Texas is actually live, to some degree.
John S. Marr: Yes. Well, obviously, it's still very early. So this has all occurred kind of in the last month. But you raise a very good point. Obviously, we've been awarded some good business, some colorful business and we focus on the financials and the effect it'll have on those. But the real important thing is here, that it was -- it's a significant project. We referred to 50,000 users, 11,000 daily filings and that's gone very, very well. So the customer's pleased, the customer's referenceable and I don't think there's any question that other states and large counties have watched that and seen how successful that it's gone. We've been awarded, as with New Hampshire and other places that are yet to come online, that are encouraged by that and there are other significant projects that are in the marketplace that I'm sure are watching that closely.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Liu from B. Riley & Co.
Kevin Liu - B. Riley Caris, Research Division: I also had a follow-up on the NorCal collaboration deal. Just in terms of the 6 counties, how long does it take to get all 6 of them on board from an implementation timeframe? And when do you get to start recognizing those subscription revenues?
Brian K. Miller: I'm not certain of what the timetable for that is, I think it's not years but it's certainly several quarters. And I'm not exactly certain when we'll start recognizing revenue, I think it'd be sometime during this year but not in the next couple of quarters.
Kevin Liu - B. Riley Caris, Research Division: Got it. And then, just as it relates to kind of the direct sales efforts around the Dynamics product. Was curious as to what sort of pipeline growth you've seen there and whether you plan -- and how much more resources you would plan to devote to that this year, relative to last?
John S. Marr: Well, we do it in a few different ways. So our existing sales channels have the product available to them and have some activity in our traditional markets with that, and then we do have a dedicated sales channel, which currently has a headcount of 3 kind of number-carrying reps and some support staff as well, and there is a person in the plan to expand that to 4, so that's the current plan.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Zukin from Stephens.
Aleksandr J. Zukin - Stephens Inc., Research Division: I wanted to ask you a little bit about the SaaS pipelines, how do they look for the year? I mean, is there any reason that you think that this year less customers will select to go to SaaS deployments over last year? And kind of what rates do you use, as you look out for the whole year, as you set your guidance?
John S. Marr: It's a good question and it's hard to know. And believe it or not, this is something that some of our marketplace is less familiar with when they enter a decision process. And they get educated and they see the traction that cloud and SaaS solutions have in the marketplace, and believe it or not, we actually get awarded business -- it's not that uncommon that we get awarded a deal and they still haven't decided whether they're going to be a SaaS or a self-hosted deal. So obviously, if they have that level of uncertainty, it's hard for us to project. I think I indicated earlier that it seems to be kind of stable around this 25% of new business number and that's pretty much what we've built our plan on as we indicated as well. That's a variable in our plan that causes us to have a wider range than we otherwise might have, as again, we really don't know sometimes until late in the process what they'll do. And while we like that business and we're particularly pleased that we're able to grow our SaaS and cloud business as significantly as we have and still have meaningful license contribution, we don't have a lot of bias in the way we sell the system. We still -- our number one objective is to win the deal and bring the client on board, and we think the clients have very high value in the long term to Tyler, regardless of which way they, basically, enter the relationship.
Aleksandr J. Zukin - Stephens Inc., Research Division: And you guys mentioned that, that was 75% last year or was that 75% last -- in the Q4 period of last year? I'm basically trying to get a sense for why would it be so much less this year, I mean, rather than just conservatism in the guidance, is there any kind of change in the market where, maybe, either from a competitive perspective, or any reason why people are saying, "You know what? We're not ready to go with a SaaS deployment this year." Maybe more people were ready last year, just trying to figure out if there's any kind of shift going on from a market perspective.
John S. Marr: I don't think there's a meaningful shift, and I think we're, as I said, I don't think we're seeing a big drop. We're seeing it kind of stabilizing in maybe the 25% range. The only thing that might marginally contribute is, I think, that when we spiked up a little higher in the more difficult years for local government, that was maybe more a reflection of the economics than a technical choice on hosted versus self-hosted, and that's eased a little bit. Local government budgets are stronger, they've got more capital available to them. And so, someone who might have chosen that direction to avoid a capital investment isn't going to do that now. They're going to make it purely on a choice to go the direction of SaaS versus self-hosted.
Brian K. Miller: And Alex, I think that comparison to last year, I think that fourth quarter of last year was 45% of the new deals, but it was significantly less -- I don't have the number in front of me, but I think it was more like 25% of the dollar volume of new deals. There were a lot of really small deals that went with the SaaS model, so whether you're looking at dollar volume or just the percentage of the names, it can vary. But I think that was somewhat random. One thing we have seen, as the year's gone along, is the average size of a SaaS customer has increased or the average contract value. So we're seeing a little bit more penetration in a little bit larger clients. Typically, the very largest ones still are self-hosted license deals but we are seeing some increase in the average size of a SaaS customer.
Aleksandr J. Zukin - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Got it. And so just for clarity, so when you said 25%, is that on a dollar value as well as on a customer value in the current quarter and planning process?
Brian K. Miller: That was in terms of the number -- the names, the number of customers. The dollar value was still a bit smaller than that percentage.
Aleksandr J. Zukin - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then, what about -- just how should we think about the way bookings should play out through the year? I mean should it follow kind of the typical historical pattern for seasonality? Or is there any other -- any kind of difference that we should be thinking about?
John S. Marr: As I indicated, I think we're bringing more awards into the year than we did last year. So, again, the big change is the big awards. So if you have a large contract that -- either you have in the comparison quarter or in the current quarter, that can skew things. But in terms of broader activity, as I said, things picked up as the year went on last year. Q3 and 4 were busy, but we weren't that busy at this time last year. So it should be a little stronger earlier in the year.
Aleksandr J. Zukin - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Got it. And the last question is, how should we think about kind of improvements in gross margins? A lot of the business, incremental business opportunities you guys are seeing carry kind of higher incremental gross margins than some of the legacy business. And so should we continue to see kind of 100 basis point improvement? Or what should we be thinking about?
John S. Marr: Yes, I think that's the way we look at our business that we'll continue to see that kind of margin expansion over the long term. The more mature units in our business have considerably higher margins than the broader business at this point. And as the parts of our business that are more in investment mode, they're less mature, grow and get to points of scale, that gap between our broader company margins and what we experience in the more mature units should narrow. I'd caution that it certainly can be lumpy and, usually, for good reason, as we had this year, certainly, there'd be a great -- there would have been a greater margin opportunity in 2013, if we hadn't had so many places that there was a compelling reason to invest. And so while we were investing in e-file Texas, we had -- in this division at Munis alone, we had over 40 on-boarding heads as we turned the year. So those are heads that have been hired that we're training and investing in that aren't yet billable. So there's a lot of investment going on in the company, service channels, products, et cetera that stifle a little bit the margin expansion. So it'll be a little bit lumpy. Hopefully, for those reasons, that there's compelling things to invest in, that we want to support, but certainly over the longer range, we still believe we have a long ways to go in terms of margin expansion.
Brian K. Miller: And Alex, just to close the loop on the subscription versus -- the SaaS versus license deals. In Q4, it was 26% of the names and 20% of the dollar value of the new deals were subscription. Last year it was 43% of the names but 29% of the dollar value. So the absolute dollar value...
Aleksandr J. Zukin - Stephens Inc., Research Division: And that was for the quarter. And what -- do you know what those numbers are for fiscal '13 versus fiscal '12?
Brian K. Miller: Hang on just a second. Yes. So for fiscal '13, it was 32% of the deals were SaaS and 68% license. And in terms of the dollar value, it was about 18% SaaS and 82% license. So it does bounce around from quarter-to-quarter, but -- and those would have been an increases over what we saw in '12 as well, in terms of the subscription mix.
Operator: And our next question comes from Josh Goldberg from G2 Investment Partners.
Josh Goldberg - G2 Investment Partners Management LLC: As [indiscernible] in your gross margin, your EBITDA, all were strong [indiscernible] expectations. The tax rate though came in pretty high at 42.5%. Can you just talk about what happened there? Was that an unexpectedly high tax rate? Was that something you kind of expected going in? And I have a follow-up.
Brian K. Miller: It was unexpectedly high and it cost us pretty much a solid $0.01 in EPS in Q4 because of the catch-up effect. Without getting too technical about it, it really was the result in a roundabout way of a high level of stock option exercises. There's a tax deduction that we typically take for qualified manufacturing activities, called the Section 199 deduction, and that typically takes somewhere from 1.5 to 2 points off our tax rate. But that tax deduction is reduced by the level of income that employees recognize on stock option exercises. And that's a somewhat unpredictable number and, certainly, something that's out of our control. And we did have a high level of stock option exercises in the last half of the year, which, effectively, by the time we got to the fourth quarter, eliminated that deduction for us and raised our tax rate by that amount. The flip side of it, a high level of employee stock option activity, is that we get a cash tax benefit from that. So it has a negative effect on our rate but has a very positive effect on the amount of cash taxes we paid and, effectively, we paid almost no cash taxes for the year. So hopefully, that clarifies it a bit. And that's one of the reasons why the range of tax rate in our guidance is a bit broader this year. We think it'll be between 39% and 41%, but that's a fairly wide range because of the effect of that one deduction.
Josh Goldberg - G2 Investment Partners Management LLC: Okay. And I guess, obviously, your guidance of $1.76 to $1.85, just putting that in the midpoint of that range, if you take the increase in the taxes and your share count, on a pretax basis, it looks like you're growing your expectation originally, because the original expectation for '14 is that your pretax income should grow north of 30%, or exactly 30%, for the year. Just want to make sure I have that right, so your pretax income is growing 30% but because of the higher taxes and the higher share count, your earnings will only show about a 21% growth in '14.
Brian K. Miller: Directionally, that would be correct. We don't give up specific pretax number but, as we said, at least at the high end of our range, 13% or 14%, 15% top line growth, low 20s earnings growth would be very much in line with our long-term expectations. And -- but, yes, the tax rate and the increased share count, both mostly because of stock option transactions, would be -- have an outsized impact on that.
Josh Goldberg - G2 Investment Partners Management LLC: Okay. Can you just talk a little bit of some of the smaller items like your appraisal services, your hardware business, obviously, those showed some decline here in the fourth quarter, what your expectations are for those segments here in 2014.
John S. Marr: Well, hardware -- go ahead, Brian.
Brian K. Miller: I was going to comment on appraisal services, it bounces around within a relatively narrow range but it's typically around a $20 million to low $20 million business, typically contracts there that last a number of quarters and it's somewhat cyclical with respect to appraisal cycles in different states where they're mandated by law. For 2013, it was a bit of a down year there. 2014, we expect to be a bit of an up year there and it's fairly visible. So I'd say we expect to see mid to -- yes, mid-single digit growth in the appraisal services business next year.
Josh Goldberg - G2 Investment Partners Management LLC: Okay. And obviously, the subscription business, showing 52% growth, really, very strong number, I know that was aided by the increase in the e-filing business. In spite of the e-filing business being a little bit of a drag on margins, your gross margin on that segment also showed some nice growth, it went to 43.8% for the quarter. I'm just wondering kind of as you're projecting out for '14, are we going to see some improvement even off of that level of 43.8% as you get more of the tax e-filing in line in Texas, as well as some of the other opportunities that you might have to grow your gross margin on that important segment?
Brian K. Miller: Well, certainly, in the long run, e-filing margins are above our current blended margins and are fairly strong margins relative to other lines of business. So we do expect that as we see growth in that business that, that will be a meaningful contributor to long-term margin expansion. As John mentioned earlier in the call, we also have upfront costs associated with new projects, as new e-filing clients come online, and it takes sometimes a fairly long lead time from the time we start to initiate one of those projects to the time that it becomes really fully implemented and that it's fully mandatory where we get the volumes we need to fully realize margin opportunities. So with respect to any specific quarter, it may bounce around a bit, but on the long run, we do expect e-filing to be a meaningful contributor to margin expansion.
Operator: And at this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Marr, I'll turn the call back over to you for any closing remarks.
John S. Marr: Well, thank you, Jamie. We appreciate all of you joining us on the call today. If there are any further questions, then please contact Brian or myself. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your telephone lines.

Operator: Hello, and welcome to today's Tyler Technologies Third Quarter 2013 Conference Call. Your host for today's call is John Marr, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, October 24, 2013. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Marr. Please go ahead.
John S. Marr: Thank you, Gary, and welcome to our third quarter 2013 earnings call. With me on the call today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like for Brian to give the Safe Harbor statements. Next, I'll have some preliminary comments, Brian will review the details of our operating results, then I'll have some final comments and we'll take your questions. Brian?
Brian K. Miller: Thanks, John. During the course of this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information that may make -- may include projections concerning the company's future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Please note also that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. John?
John S. Marr: Thank you, Brian. Our third quarter financial performance continued a trend of steady growth, with results achieving or exceeding our expectations by most measures. This was our 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth, as well as our 50th consecutive profitable quarter. Our recurring revenues for subscriptions and maintenance continue to be major drivers of our growth, as together, they grew 16% and represented approximately 60% of total revenues for the quarter. Our subscription revenues growth of 34% reflects a continued shift toward cloud-based software as a service businesses, as well as fast-growing transaction-based revenue streams. At the same time, we are pleased that software licenses and royalty revenues were up 17% over last year, which is attributable to the growth of our proprietary licenses, as well as an increase in royalties in Microsoft Dynamics AX sales. Gross margins, as expected, declined 160 basis points to 46.3% as we are incurring cost ahead of revenues for certain e-filing contracts, mainly TexFile, as well as accelerating hirings to build capacity to deliver current and anticipated backlog. New contract signings were extremely strong across all of our major products, which is reflective, first, of our competitive strengths and, second, of an ongoing broader improvement in the local government market environment. Bookings in the third quarter were the strongest in our history, even before the addition of the TexFile contract, which contributed $72 million in bookings. Our Courts & Justice business had a strong quarter for new contracts. We signed Odyssey court case management software contracts with the states of Washington and Idaho, our 10th and 11th statewide court software contracts. These 2 deals have a combined value of more than $25 million. We also signed 4 Odyssey court software contracts in California. 3 of these were signed under the master service agreement. Merced County and Kern County would utilize Odyssey throughout their Superior Courts and Orange County will initially implement Odyssey in the Superior Courts for family and juvenile case types. Merced County will also use Odyssey File & Serve solutions for e-filing. In addition, we signed an Odyssey contract with the Fresno County Superior Court under a procurement that took place outside the MSA. Beyond California, we signed a contract for Odyssey with Shelby County, Tennessee. Shelby County is the home of Memphis and is the largest county in the state. They will be our first major Odyssey site in Tennessee. We signed a contract with Washington County, Pennsylvania for appraisal services, as well as iasWorld property appraisal and tax administration software. The contract, valued at approximately $7 million, will enable the county to conduct its first property reassessment since 1981. Among the more significant contracts for our ERP solutions were traditional on-premise contracts with the cities of Boulder, Colorado and Green Bay, Wisconsin, as well as Saas contracts in Joliet, Illinois and Hallandale Beach, Florida. For our Eagle recording and document management solutions, we signed a 7-year SaaS contract valued at approximately $3 million with Wayne County, Michigan. We also announced a new product, Tyler eTimekeeper, an application used via our web browser and, within mobile devices, allows public sector employees to access time and attendance tracking information remotely. Now I'd like for Brian to provide more details on the operating results of the quarter.
Brian K. Miller: Thanks, John. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2013. Since our press release and 10-Q are both available now, I'm going to add color around some of the key factors in the quarter, then move on to John's comments on the current quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2013. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2012, we added additional non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. Our non-GAAP earnings exclude share-based compensation expense, the employer portion of payroll taxes on employee stock transactions and amortization of acquired intangibles. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. Also beginning with the first quarter of 2013, we have included the Dynamics royalty revenues in the software licenses and royalties line. These were previously included in hardware and other revenue, and prior year amounts have been reclassified for comparability. Revenues for the third quarter were $107.0 million, a new quarterly high, up 14%. Organic revenue growth was 11.5%, and EnerGov, acquired in November 2012, accounted for 2.5 percentage points of growth. Software license and royalty revenues increased 17.0%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, software licenses and royalties grew 13.4%, which is attributable to the increase in Microsoft Dynamics royalties, as well as growth in Tyler proprietary license sales to new customers. In Q3, we received $1 million of royalties on public sector sales of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 by other Microsoft partners, more than triple the $269,000 in royalties a year ago and a sequential increase of more than 50% from Q2 of this year. In addition, we had approximately $573,000 of revenues related to Tyler's direct sales of Dynamics, which are included in software license, services, maintenance and subscription revenues. Organic license revenue growth continues to be pressured somewhat by the increasing percentage of new customers selecting subscription-based arrangements. Subscriptions continue to be our fastest-growing revenue line and grew 34.2%, all of -- of which all but 1.1% was organic. We added 24 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 14 existing installed clients compared to a total of 12 new arrangements and 19 conversions in the third quarter of 2012. Approximately 30% of our new software clients opted for one of our cloud-based solutions compared to 23% of new clients in the third quarter of 2012. There were several relatively large SaaS contracts this quarter, and 3 of the new Saas contracts and one of the conversions each had total contract values of more than $2 million. The subscription line also includes the growing revenue stream from transaction-based revenues such as e-filing for courts and online payments. These revenues rose approximately 54% to $4.0 million from $2.6 million last year. We expect to continue to see solid growth in these revenues as both current and new clients adopt our Odyssey File & Serve solution and more of them move towards mandatory e-filing. Software services revenues increased 12.5%, with 6.6% organic and 5.9% from acquisitions. Organic growth was primarily driven by the higher level of bookings in recent quarters. Maintenance revenue growth was 10.9%, of which 9.5% was organic. Our maintenance revenue growth rate continues to be reduced somewhat by the increasing percentage of new Saas clients as well as the effect of existing installed clients converting to our hosted offerings, which results in a loss of maintenance revenue offset by a larger increase in subscription revenue. Our blended gross margin for the quarter was 46.3% compared to 47.9% last year. This decrease was mainly due to the start-up cost expense related to the TexFile e-filing contract, with minimal-related revenues, as well as costs associated with accelerated hiring, particularly in professional services and support to ensure that we have the capacity to deliver our growing backlog of business. SG&A expense increased 17.6% in the quarter and represented 23% of total revenues, an increase of 70 basis points from last year's third quarter, with stock compensation being the major reason for the increase. Noncash share-based compensation expense was $3.1 million compared to $1.9 million last year. $408,000 was included in cost of revenues and $2.7 million was included in SG&A expense. Excluding noncash share-based compensation expense, and the employer portion of payroll taxes on employee stock transactions, SG&A expense was 20.0% of revenues, compared to 24 -- 20.4% last year. Net research and development expense was $6 million compared to $4.3 million. R&D expense in the third quarter of 2012 was offset by $1 million in reimbursements from Microsoft. We have not received any R&D expense reimbursements since last year's third quarter and do not expect to receive any further reimbursements from Microsoft on this project. Operating income was $17.9 million compared to $18.7 million, a decrease of 4.3%. Non-GAAP operating income was $23.1 million, up 3.7%. The non-GAAP operating margin declined 210 basis points to 21.6%. Net income was $11.0 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, compared to $10.8 million, or $0.33 per diluted share. The fully diluted share count increased by approximately 1.8 million shares. Non-GAAP net income was $14.7 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, compared to $13.2 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2012. Adjusted EBITDA, which is EBITDA plus noncash share-based compensation expense, was $24.2 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, an increase of 2.9% compared to $23.5 million, or $0.71 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2012. Free cash flow was $35.7 million compared to $31.8 million. Excluding real estate CapEx, our free cash flow was $40.7 million versus $32.9 million. This improvement is primarily attributable to an increase in cash from operations associated with higher deferred revenue collections related to growth in recurring revenues. Days sales outstanding in accounts receivable was 76 days at September 30, 2013 compared to 75 days at September 30, 2012. DSOs decreased sequentially from 106 days at June 30, which is our normal trend as we bill a significant portion of our maintenance in Q2, resulting in an increase in receivables with the related revenue deferred over the next 12 months. Our backlog at the end of the quarter reached a new high of $541.0 million, up 51.2%. Backlog related to our software business, which excludes backlog from appraisal services contracts, was $517.6 million, a 57.7% increase. Backlog included $135.3 million of maintenance compared to $108.7 million a year ago. Subscription backlog was $189.3 million compared to $79.5 million a year ago. Subscription backlog included approximately $71.5 million related to the TexFile contracts to provide e-filing for civil courts statewide in Texas. This contract was signed in November 2012 and under the original contract, Tyler was to earn revenues based on a fee per filing. Because these transaction-based revenues are contingent on future filings, they were not included in bookings or backlog at the time of the contract signing, which is also the case with our other transaction-based e-filing arrangements. The TexFile contract was amended in the third quarter of 2013 to provide for e-filing fees to Tyler under a fixed price arrangement regardless of actual filing volumes. The total value of the 4-year contract is approximately $72 million, which is generally in line with the total revenues that we expected to receive on a per-filing basis over the life of the contract. With the conversion to a fixed price contract, the entire contract value was included in bookings in the quarter. Excluding the TexFile contract, total backlog increased 31.2% over last year. Our bookings for the quarter, which are calculated from the change in backlog plus revenues, were up 135.9% to $217 million. Excluding the TexFile contract, bookings were still exceptionally strong, up 58.2%. For the 12 months ended September 30, bookings were up approximately 43% over the prior 12-month period. We signed 29 new contracts in the third quarter that included software licenses greater than $100,000, and those contracts had an average license of $674,000 compared to 16 new contracts with an average license value of $232,000 in the third quarter of 2012. Our total headcount grew by 51, to 2,482 employees at the end of the third quarter compared to 2,431 at the end of the second quarter. We currently expect to add approximately 125 additional employees by the end of the year. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to John for his further comments.
John S. Marr: Thanks, Brian. As you've seen, this was a solid quarter, and results generally met or exceeded our internal expectations. Recovery in the broad local government market environment is continuing. Our competitive position and win rates are very strong, and our new business pipeline is active. Historically, the market slows down a little during the summer months. We often anxiously wait for Labor Day and people to return to regular schedules and start making decisions again. This summer, that clearly was not the case. Procurement processes seem to remain very active. In fact, I don't ever remember as busy a summer in sales. We've talked before about the continued investments we made during the slower markets of 2010 and 2011. And we benefited from those investments in this busier market. While the increased market activity is encouraging and has provided a significant increase in bookings and backlog, it will be interesting to see over the next couple of quarters whether this represents some catch-up of deferred decisions or more robust market that is sustainable. I suspect that it's a bit of both. As we mentioned earlier in the call, our royalty revenues for Microsoft this quarter nearly quadrupled over last year's third quarter, and increased sequentially from last year's -- last quarter by more than 50%. Quarterly royalties surpassed the $1 million for the first time. These royalties were generated by sales of Dynamics AX to approximately 57 public sector entities in 18 different countries. Although this was only our seventh quarter of royalties, we continue to be encouraged by the progress across the very broad marketplace, as reflected by the number of new deals in the widespread geographical foot print. In our direct sales channel for Dynamics, we signed 1 new contract during the quarter, which has not yet been announced, and have been selected or shortlisted in several other opportunities. Among our early Dynamics clients, Walker County, Texas went live upon financials and our Dynamics project that we signed with the City of Columbus, Ohio in late Q2 is now under way and going well. In Courts, there's obviously, continues to be a great deal of attention focused on the California marketplace. We remain very actively pursuing opportunities with courts in California following the state's termination last year of the project to develop internally our custom statewide case management system. We have now signed contracts for Odyssey with 6 of the state's 58 counties and expect to receive additional awards before the end of the year. As we discussed earlier in the call, we are making significant investments in the start-up of TexFile, a statewide implementation in Texas of our electronic filing solution for courts. We are well under way with work on the TexFile project, with 16 counties live, including 3 of the top 10 counties where e-filing will be mandatory for civil cases at the start of 2010. The amendment to convert the TexFile contract to fixed price provides us with even greater visibility over those revenues. We expect to recognize $3.1 million on TexFile in the fourth quarter and approximately $17 million next year. We are also pursuing a number of additional e-file opportunities with current Odyssey clients as well as with courts that do not use Odyssey. With each new e-file contract, we will incur costs ahead of revenues, which may put short-term pressure on margins, as has been the case this year. We believe that these recurring transaction-based revenue streams will contribute significantly to revenue and margin expansion in coming years. In light of our results in the third quarter, our bookings and general market conditions, we are increasingly confident in our outlook for the full year and, accordingly, have revised upward our revenue and earnings guidance. Our updated guidance for the full year 2013 is as follows: We currently expect 2013 revenues to be between $412 million and $416 million. We expect 2013 diluted GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $1.10 to $1.15. And fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be approximately $34.5 million. We expect 2013 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be approximately $1.49 to $1.54. For the year, estimated noncash share-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $11.7 million. We estimate an effective tax rate for 2013 of approximately 39.5%. We expect our total capital expenditures will be approximately $27 million to $28 million for the year. Capital expenditures for the year include approximately $20 million related to real estate and office facility construction. Total depreciation and amortization is expected to be between approximately $14 million and $14.5 million, including approximately $6.5 million of the amortization of acquired intangibles. Now we'll take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Charlie Strauzer of CJS Securities.
Charles Strauzer - CJS Securities, Inc.: Just a quick question. When you look at -- this is kind of a little bit of a bigger picture question, but when you look at the Dynamics and the success you've had so far and in talking to some of the channel partners that you're getting royalties from, where do think the success points have been? And where do you think some of the pushbacks have been as well in terms of where you haven't won contracts and what's giving you kind of the confidence there as going forward?
John S. Marr: I guess probably our impression is that there isn't any single or couple of real concentrations of where it's successful. The numbers are reasonable but they're not explosive at this point, but what is encouraging is the number of sites sold by the number of partners and in such a large geographical area. The number of countries that we're represented in. Obviously, most of those sales are through different partners. So the number of partners that are embracing Dynamics AX and building a practice around it in such a broad geography is what's encouraging to us. That's exactly why we enter this relationship. We're also hopeful, Dynamics will contribute in our traditional marketplaces as well, but we're encouraged by the exposure we're getting to the broader international markets that we otherwise, wouldn't have exposure to.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Kinstlinger of Sidoti & Company.
Brian Kinstlinger - Sidoti & Company, LLC: My first question is has there been any timeline set or early discussions about the RFPs in some of the larger California counties for courts case management? And I guess as part of that, John, you mentioned you expected to win a few other counties by year end in California, can you talk about the size in terms of population?
John S. Marr: It does seem that the smaller and midsized counties are moving first here. They're simply larger projects, and I think defining their scope and project pointers is more involved in the larger counties. We do expect larger county activity eventually. We're having conversations with them, but they're not in -- into the real official procurement mode at this point in time. And that's probably fine with us. Obviously, these projects and states' specific functionalities, integration extensions and a lot of the things that come with early county adoption in a new state are all things we're under way addressing and we'll be in an even better position to be responsive to as the larger opportunities come along. The other thing that happens is even in a county, it's kind of a serial process. They start with certain case types or certain courts within the county and then it will expand from there. So the dollars for the initial engagements sometimes don't look as high as we might think, but they're generally not for all courts and all case types within the county. So I think in all of these counties, this will -- there'll be multi-year projects that are geared in one court or one case type and expand from there. And we're hopeful that in most cases, they expand to include Odyssey File & Serve as well.
Brian Kinstlinger - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Great and then my follow-up to that -- like, Orange County, I think you are talking about, but my follow-up is in light of the strengthening demand in your environment you've talked about, do you expect Dynamics sales might be stronger in '14 than maybe you thought 6 to 9 months ago? And when we think about the Columbus, for example, they were using some very old software that a bunch of their neighboring counties were using. And there was a talk a while back that many of those other neighboring countries would follow suit with Columbus. So maybe just talk about how the demand environment is in Dynamics and then maybe those counties and should things move a little bit quicker, given the environment is stronger.
John S. Marr: Well, we're going to remain cautious on the trajectory of Dynamics revenues. If you look at the increases on a percentage basis quarter over same quarter last year or sequentially over the last quarter, they are impressive. I think when we model Dynamics, we would flatten that curve modestly as we look out over the next couple of years and set our expectation at that level. Certainly, there's the possibility that, that elevates and goes above that curve, but that's the way we think of it. We're building an entire business around it. That's important but it's complex, sales channels, service channels, product expansion channels. So we're still building a business around this and we want to be cautious about that outlook but we certainly are encouraged. Again, quarter over same quarter last year sequentially those are nice trends, and our expectations as we model forward will be to again bend those curves a little bit on the flat side and run the business from that.
Operator: Our -- your next question comes from Scott Berg of Northland Capital.
Scott R. Berg - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division: First one for John. Second one for Brian. John, can you comment of the overall deal environment in the quarter and was the strength in the quarter relative to an increased number of just general sales cycles going on? Or is it more reflection of improving run rates or some combination of both?
John S. Marr: It's definitely a combination of both, and as I've said, in summer, we're usually frustrated when we are talking about the sales channel because we put a lot of work in the processes and they seem to stall and people are on vacation and so forth and even in the committees, one person out can stall a process, and decisions just continued to happen and processes moved forward. So clearly, people are addressing, whether they're deferred decisions or pent-up demand, but we clearly saw a much more active third quarter or summer market than what we traditionally see. And as I said, fortunately, we made significant investments in '10 and '11, when I think a lot of our competitors were more cautious and we certainly benefited from that in terms of win rate. If you look at Brian's comments on the number of deals over $100,000 and actually if we were to talk about the $500,000 or $1 million in licenses, in those average deal sizes, that also was a strong contributor. On our higher end is where we saw a lot of the improved competitive decision giving us some feedback. I think that sector of the market has probably weakened a little bit in terms of broader competition and, obviously, both with the investments we've made in the products as well as the reference ability of sites we've sold in that size range over the last 2 or 3 years that's probably the sector where we'll become the most improved.
Scott R. Berg - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division: Then piggybacking off that a little bit, Brian, 20 new license deals in the quarter are greater than $100,000. New subscription deals is up materially in the third quarter but you didn't beat much on the revenue line in the quarter, both on the license and total revenue. Is that an indication that these deals will be -- a large chunk of them are recognized ratably over a period of time, implementations over the next 4 to 6 quarters than, obviously, all upfront in the third quarter?
Brian K. Miller: Yes, that is the case. On -- it's not driven necessarily by the size of the deals but the way that the contracts work out, typically the very large deals are a percentage of completion accounting, where we recognize the license as the services are performed generally over a number of quarters. That's certainly the case with all of our Odyssey deals, all of our appraisal and tax deals and the larger ERP deals that John mentioned as well. So yes, there's a larger percentage of those deals that are percentage of completion accounting that we don't get upfront.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Ho of William Blair.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Just to start out, I wanted to get a better sense. When you guys talk about hiring, in what areas are you looking to add additional staff? Is this mainly on the deployment and sort of fulfillment end of this or is this additional sales capacity, where you're just seeing so many deals in the pipeline that you feel like you need more folks there as well?
John S. Marr: No question, the biggest headcount additions will come in the professional service and deployment side of the business and clearly that would be with the heads being added that are above planned. The TexFile heads, for the most part, are in plan. There's a fair amount of help desk work around e-file as they come online. The law offices and so forth call these help desks. So there's some help desk heads, but Professional Services would be the highest area. A little bit of development but we've got full complements of staff there. So certainly on a much lower rate than revenue increases and very few in sales. We kept our sales channel at a certain size through '10 and '11, when it was not that busy, but these are experienced people that know our business, have the subject matter expertise to work with the marketplace and we kept our headcount generally where it was and so, we have felt that we have more capacity in the sales channel than what we were performing at. I would say we might have a 4-, 5-, 6-head kind of growth in that area over the next 6 months or so but certainly not a significant number in relation to all the heads we are adding.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Got it. And just in terms of the Microsoft opportunity, is there a way that or have you seen any initiatives on Microsoft's side to maybe get the sales distribution partners to more rapidly adopt either through investments or training or just broader spending support for the product? I just want to get a sense whether there's any shift there or an acceleration that you guys are seeing?
John S. Marr: I think Microsoft's folks themselves in the way they work with their partners, they are very aggressive and they're working hard. I've warned about it and it's just a business that takes a long time to grow. We have a product now. The product's well received in the marketplace and the early implementations are going well, but for their partners and even for us with our direct business, building out the sales channel, the service channel, the programmatic extensions, conversions takes time and I've kind of said -- I think you might want to look at Odyssey as an example. That's a product that was well received initially, the early adopters were very successful but it takes time to build a business around it. It's profitable and reliable and has good visibility and that's where we are with it. So I think it will continue to grow and we're encouraged by that but these are the kinds of things that definitely take some time to reach a point where they're significant contributors to our business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Raghavan Sarathy of Dougherty & Company.
Raghavan Sarathy - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division: Just one question for John. So you touched on this a little bit before that you are in conversation with the larger counties but they are not in procurement at that point -- at this point. Can you talk about how these counties are trying to address the funding challenge? I've noticed that the smaller to midsize counties are able to get money from AOC or probably use some sort of emergency funding, but when you look at the larger counties, you are looking at several million dollars of projects and how are they trying to address this funding requirement?
John S. Marr: I guess I'm not aware of a consistent way that we could apply to a range of counties, but I think you're right. It's a combination of their own county resources and what they can get from the state and it is a challenge for them, obviously. The reality is the projects that we're executing are -- deliver more value in our view than the project they had on the table before, but there is not some large statewide funding for it. So they all have to put together their local resources and get what they can from the administrative office of the courts and the state, but I'm not sure that there is a single process that's typical from county to county.
Raghavan Sarathy - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division: Maybe if I can ask this question a little differently. So the larger counties, they have been little bit slow to move. Is the funding a gaiting factor or is just the scope of the project itself is -- they are taking a little more time to evaluate vendors then get into a procurement process?
John S. Marr: Right. I think it's more the latter. So they tend to have IT staffs. They tend to be in a position to keep the existing system as much as it's not current or competitive. They're in a better position to have a function for them and extend its life. Defining their scope and statements of work and exactly what the project includes is a bigger process and takes longer than a smaller county. So I think the smaller counties are in more urgent need. They don't have the resources to extend the life of their existing systems. The projects are little more straightforward and they can pull the trigger more quickly and, again, the larger ones have complexities that take some time to address.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Schappel of Benchmark.
Mark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division: John, you reported several large deal wins during the past quarter or 2 here and I was just wondering if there's any concern on your part being able to hire implementation consultants quick enough to staff these projects?
John S. Marr: No, I don't think we're able -- I think it's actually what we do well. One of the reasons we're successful in this space is it's nice to have a product that demonstrates well and is current and competitive, and we do have that. But we've got a history of executing on time, within budgets and managing the scope. And there's a risk-averse market and that's a big part of our success along with exciting products and I think that's what we'll leverage through this growth patch. The market has certainly shifted a little bit. A couple of years ago, anytime you were looking for positions, you had many, many, many qualified candidates very aggressively pursuing those and certainly that's shifted a little bit. So our HR group is geared up and in recruitment mode and we're running a lot of different recruitment activities at all of our major divisions. So it's something that you can't take for granted and it's a good sign for the broader environment, obviously, that it's a little less of an employer market, but we still get a really good pool of people looking for these jobs and I still think we're an employer of choice in the markets that we're in. So it's an active, ongoing process to recruit and find the right and the best people for these positions and we've been successful in doing that, but it is also, certainly, a little more challenged in a couple of years ago and, obviously, that's a good thing if we're looking at the broader macro issues.
Mark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay, and then as a final question here, who do you compete with regarding the Orange County or courts deal?
John S. Marr: Well, the 3 vendors on the MSA are involved in these deals and they can look at those. I think we were -- I think we've been kind of the preferred vendor for some time. There doesn't seem to be another vendor that's -- no other vendor has won multiple deals in California. So we feel good about establishing ourselves as the leader in that marketplace.
Operator: Our next lesson comes from Matt Williams of Evercore.
Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: I just had one in terms of sort of the, I guess, lower end of the markets. We've seen a lot of headlines and press releases around some of the larger deals. Is that, I guess, sort of lower end holding up as well as maybe the large end is? Or is there any sort of pressure there? I guess, just any commentary on kind of the run rate or the smaller deal sizes and sort of how that market is holding up as well?
John S. Marr: Well, that is certainly where Tyler has grown up from and I think it is holding up, and we continue to have a strong position in that marketplace, where we've been strong for some time. Now I would say that the vision that focus on those size accounts performed more in line with what our expectations were. In the lower tiers of the divisions that sell across sizes, the same would be true. I would say the outperform in terms of the additional deals over what we might have expected weren't on our higher end of the range. And, as you know, for some time that's been one of our growth strategies, is to move up that scale somewhat and become a strong in, I guess I'd call it, the tier 2 space of the whole marketplace, which is kind of our high end of the range, and we've had a lot of success there over the last quarter and so we're -- we feel good about that.
Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Great, and then maybe just 2 quick ones on the California deals that have come out, I think Fresno was not under the MSA, I was just wondering if there was anything in particular with that deal that structured it outside of the MSA? And then I guess on the Orange County deal, I know I believe it's family and juvenile for right now. Did that project sort of start at that level, with just those 2 courts or was that sort of a -- started at a much higher level and, whether it was needs based or financially driven, it sort of trickled down just to those 2?
John S. Marr: No, I think the strategy was to start with the most urgent areas and, obviously, they can manage their exposure that way and it gives us an incentive to perform well and expand into the other courts and case types.
Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Okay, and then on the Fresno deal, any color as to maybe whether that was outside the MSA?
John S. Marr: No, not really, not certain other than there's a little uncertainty around the MSA and the timing, so they were actively engaged in their process while the MSA was being finalized. So I guess it would be interesting to see if, now that it's a fact that the MSA exists, whether other countries would choose to run an independent procurement process. Certainly, they can. And if their scope or their project, they feel, is unique or they need that amount -- those processes do have a benefit. They -- obviously, the RFT [ph] can be very specific about what the project is going to be and our response is very specific as well, and that, obviously, becomes the basis of the scope of work for the project. So it could be that some counties feel that there's a value to that process and may choose to run an independent procurement process. At this point, the majority of the deals we're working on, we would assume would go through the MSA.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Liu of B. Riley & Co.
Kevin Liu - B. Riley Caris, Research Division: Just in terms of the bigger SaaS deals you're seeing hit the backlog now, I'm curious if you could add some more color whether those are just longer duration or more whether you're perhaps seeing more adoption by some of the larger cities and counties out there?
John S. Marr: Well, we mentioned one, Wayne County. That's kind of unusually long, 7 years. We don't even necessarily encourage that but sometimes there's some cost. Usually, that's because there is cost involved in the deployment at the start-up that we need to be certain we're going to recover if we're going to include them in the SaaS fee. So that's usually the reason for the extended terms, because we have 0 attrition in our SaaS business, so we're not usually overly concerned about getting customers tied up for a longer period of time. Typical durations are 4 years, 5 years. Some of them are 3 years. And I think that works well for both the client and for us. In terms of size, that's the larger number because of the number of years, 7 years included in it. They tend to not be our largest accounts at this point. They tend to be the lower and midrange accounts at this point, and that trend seems to be continuing. As the market clearly opened up here recently and people recommitted, and if that's a indication of them becoming healthier and stronger, I was wondering a little bit because one of the reasons for us with the adoption of SaaS to move from 12%, 15% of our new-customer decisions to 30%-ish was to spread their cost out over a longer period of time, and if that softens, is it going to go back to the old numbers? And it really hasn't. Those numbers have held up strong. So we're encouraged by that.
Kevin Liu - B. Riley Caris, Research Division: And then just one on the TexFile contract, I wanted to clarify some of the differences in the terms. In terms of when you guys start to receive payments, should we just assume kind of fixed fee whenever the system is live? And then I'm just wondering if it's cash receipt on kind of an annual or a quarterly basis here?
Brian K. Miller: We actually started to receive -- to recognize revenues this quarter under the fixed-price arrangement. So we recognized a little less than $600,000 this quarter. It will be about $3.7 million, $3.8 million in Q4 and around $17 million next year. So those revenues are being recognized and the billing is generally quarterly in arrears, so we receive the cash afterwards.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Brian Kinstlinger of Sidoti & Company.
Brian Kinstlinger - Sidoti & Company, LLC: I have 2 follow-ups. The first one is, if you can talk about any large counties or states other than Texas, of course, that are expecting to mandate e-filing over the next 4 quarters and, if so, can you name which ones those are?
John S. Marr: No, we generally would rather not do that. Obviously, I know the investment community is interested in that but, obviously, there's a competitive marketplace out there as well. So we'd prefer to not draw any attention to any competitive processes we're in. Generally, we don't till they're contracted. Occasionally, especially in these larger deals, the client announces things ahead of that and then, obviously, we affirm that. But otherwise, we'd rather not comment on specific engagements.
Brian Kinstlinger - Sidoti & Company, LLC: I'm sorry, I misunderstood. I should have worded it better. Counties or states where you're already installed, for example, if you have e-file already in Minnesota or if you have e-file already in an existing state or county, the e-file piece, where you're already in there and it's not a competitive process, are there any mandates coming through those?
John S. Marr: No, again, they are competitive processes, Brian. Certainly -- just like we are pursuing e-file opportunities in states and large countries where we don't have the case management system, if we were talking to one of our clients about it, they may go to bid, they may sole source it, but it's certainly a competitive process and I don't think it's to our benefit to talk about those.
Brian K. Miller: There are couple of relatively small ones that are already signed. For example, in Oregon, each county, I believe it's 6 months after they go live, they become -- e-filing becomes mandatory. And we've talked about before in Minnesota, which has been an Odyssey client for some time, e-filing is being rolled out across the state. Neither of those are tremendously large. The 2 largest counties in Minnesota have already been mandatory for some time and are included in our current numbers.
Operator: At this time, there appear to be no more questions. Mr. Marr, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.
John S. Marr: Okay, thank you, Gary, and thank all of you for joining us on the call today. If you do have further questions, certainly feel free to contact myself or Brian Miller. Have a good day.

===== 2013 Q2  (2013-07-25 10:00:00) =====
Executives:  John S. Marr Jr. – President and Chief Executive Officer Brian K. Miller – Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer 
Analysts:  Brian D. Kinstlinger – Sidoti & Co. LLC Nathan Schneiderman – Roth Capital Partners Daniel Cummins – B. Riley & Co. Scott R. Berg – Northland Capital Markets Dan Moore – CJS Securities, Inc. Mark W. Schappel – The Benchmark Co. LLC  
Operator:  Hello and welcome to today’s Tyler Technologies Second Quarter 2013 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, today, July 25, 2013. Your host for today’s call is John Marr, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. Mr. Marr, I would now like to turn the call over to you. Please go ahead.
John S. Marr, Jr.: Thank you, and welcome to our second quarter 2013 earnings call. With me on the call today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I’d like for Brian to give the Safe Harbor statement. Next, I’ll have some preliminary comments, Brian will give the details of our operating results, then I’ll have some final comments, and then we’ll take your questions. Brian?
Brian K. Miller: Thanks, John. During the course of this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information that may include projections concerning the company’s future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. John?
John S. Marr, Jr.: Our second quarter financial performance continued the trend of steady growth in virtually every meaningful metric with results very much inline with our expectations. This was our 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth and our 49th consecutive profitable quarter. We also reached a new milestone with our first quarter of revenues of more than a $100 million.  Our recurring revenues from subscriptions and maintenance continue to be the primary driver of our growth, as together they grew 15% and represented approximately 59% of total revenues for the quarter. The growth in subscription revenues reflects the continued shift toward the cloud and new business as well as the growing transaction based revenue stream. At the same time, we are pleased that our software license and royalty revenues were up almost 20% over last year, which is attributable to licenses from EnerGov, which we acquired last November, and contributed $1.3 million of licenses this quarter together with the significant increase in royalties from Microsoft Dynamics AX sales.   The higher license and royalty revenues together with the leverage and our recurring revenue growth led to an increase in gross margin of 110 basis points, and our non-GAAP operating margin grew 200 basis points to 19.3%. New contract signings were relatively strong across Tyler, and bookings in the second quarter grew 24% over last year.  The broader local government marketplace continues to gradually strengthen in our strong competitive position including our cloud based offerings, is helping us increase our share. The largest contract we signed during the second quarter was with New York City for our iasWorld property appraisal and tax administration software. The contract is valued at approximately $18.4 million, including a perpetual license. The revenues will be recognized over the implementation period of approximately 12 quarters. Obviously, New York City is a large and complex jurisdiction in which our software will manage the property taxes associated with more than 1 million properties worth approximately $800 billion. This is the largest software contract in Tyler’s history other than statewide core systems and our selection here is a great example of our credibility and competitive strength that Tyler has established in the local government marketplace. In Courts & Justice, we signed an Odyssey contract with Kings County, California, which we mentioned as an unsigned award on our last call. Kings County is a SaaS implementation under a five-year agreement, which will also include transaction based e-filing. We also signed an agreement to provide e-filings for the Reno, Nevada Justice Court as well as a five-year SaaS contract for Odyssey Online with (inaudible) County Texas. We had a number of significant new contracts for our newest ERP solution, including the cities of Walmart in Pueblo, Colorado. Pueblo also purchased our municipal court solution. And this was also selected by the Ector County Independent School District in Odessa, Texas and by California, Santa Barbara Unified School District. The Shelby County Schools in Memphis, Tennessee, the state’s largest school system in the 14th largest school district in the United States selected our Versatrans student transportation management system, as did Brownsville ISD, Texas. Sales activity for our EnerGov solutions is also strong. We have a number of wins for that product both on a stand-alone basis such as San Mateo California in conjunction with our ERP products. In Q2, for example the Town of Erie, Colorado signed a contract for our Incode ERP solution together with EnerGov. Now I would let Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter. Brian?
Brian K. Miller : Thanks, John. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2013. You’ve seen the press release and our 10-Q has been filed. So I want to comment on some of the key factors in the quarter, then move onto John’s comments on the current quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2013. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2012, we added additional non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results in comparisons with peers and with software industries. Our non-GAAP earnings exclude share-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangibles. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. Also beginning in the first quarter of 2013, we’ve included the Dynamics royalty revenues in the software licenses and royalties line. These were previously included in hardware and other revenue and prior year amounts have been reclassified for comparability. Revenues for the second quarter were $103.1 million, a new quarterly high up 12.8%. Organic revenue growth was 9.5% and our acquisition of EnerGov accounted for revenues of $3.1 million or 3.3 percentage points of growth. Software license and royalty revenues increased 19.8%. excluding the impact of acquisitions, software licenses and royalties grew 4.5%, most of which is attributable to the increase in Microsoft Dynamics royalties. In Q2, we received $687,000 of royalties on public sector sales of Microsoft Dynamics AX by other Microsoft partners, compared to $129,000 last year. In addition, we had approximately $216,000 of revenues related to Tyler’s direct sales of Dynamics, which are included in software services and maintenance revenues. Organic license revenue growth continues to be pressured by the increasing percentage of new customers selecting subscription-based arrangements. Subscriptions continue to be our fastest growing revenue line and grew 31.4%, of which all but, 1.3% was organic. We added 28 new subscription based arrangements and converted 15 existing installed clients, compared to a total of 24 new arrangements and 17 conversions in the second quarter of 2012. Approximately 42% of our new software clients opted for one of our cloud-based solutions, compared to 33% of new clients in the second quarter 2012. The subscriptions line also includes the growing revenue stream from transaction-based revenues such as e-filings for courts and online payments. These revenues rose approximately 33% to $3.1 million from $2.3 million last year. We expect to continue to see solid growth in these revenues as both current and new clients adopt our Odyssey File and Serve solution and more of them move towards mandatory e-filing. Software services revenues increased 10.8% with 5.7% organic and 5.1% from acquisitions. Organic growth was primarily driven by the higher level of bookings in recent quarters. Maintenance revenue growth was 10.9%, of which, 9.6% was organic. Our maintenance revenue growth rate continues to be reduced somewhat by the increasing percentage of new SaaS clients as well as the effect of existing installed clients converting to our hosted offerings, which results in a loss of maintenance revenue offset by a larger increase in subscription revenue. Our blended gross margin for the quarter was 45.6%, compared to 44.5%. this increase was due to higher license and royalty revenue and leverage in our recurring revenues. The increase in our gross margin was offset somewhat by costs incurred related to our investment in TexFile with no related revenues. SG&A expense increased 15.1% in the quarter and represented 24.2% of total revenues and an increase of 50 basis points from last year’s second quarter with stock compensation being the major reason for the increase. Non-cash share-based compensation expense was $2.9 million, compared to $1.8 million, $343,000 of the cost was included in cost of revenues and $2.6 million was included in SG&A expense. Excluding stock compensation, SG&A expense improved to 21.7% of revenues from 22.1% last year. Net research and development expense was $5.6 million, compared to $5.4 million last year. We did not receive any R&D expense reimbursement under our agreement with Microsoft in the second quarter of either 2013 or 2012, and we do not expect to receive any further reimbursements under the agreement. Operating income was $15.3 million, compared to $12.5 million or an increase of 23.2%. Non-GAAP operating income was $19.9 million, up 25.6%. The non-GAAP operating margin rose 200 basis points to 19.3%. Net income was $9.0 million or $0.26 per diluted share, compared to $7.1 million or $0.22 per diluted share. The fully diluted share count increased by approximately 1.5 million shares. Non-GAAP net income was $12.2 million or $0.36 per diluted share, compared to $9.5 million or $0.29 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2012. Adjusted EBITDA, which is EBITDA plus non-cash share based compensation expense, was $21.5 million or $0.63 per diluted share, an increase of 23.4% compared to $17.4 million or $0.53 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2012. Free cash flow was negative $9.2 million compared to negative $12.9 million. Excluding real estate CapEx, our free cash flow was negative $2 million versus negative $11 million last year. This improvement is primarily attributable to an increase in cash associated with higher deferred revenue collection  Day sales outstanding in accounts receivable was a 106 days at June 30, 2013, compared to 99 days at June 30, 2012. DSOs normally increased sequentially from Q1 to Q2, as we bill a significant portion of our maintenance in Q2, resulting in an increase in receivables with the related revenue deferred over the next 12 months. The increase in maintenance billings this year drove the higher DSOs compared to last year’s Q2. Our backlog at the end of the quarter reached a new high of $430.9 million, up 19.7%. Backlog related to our software business, which excludes backlog from appraisal services contracts was $411.1 million, a 25.3% increase. Backlog included a $139.8 million of maintenance, compared to $114.1 million a year ago. Subscription backlog was $101.2 million, compared to $72.9 million last year. Our bookings for the quarter, which are calculated from the change in backlog plus revenues, were up 23.5% to $147 million. For the 12 months ended June 30, bookings were up approximately 16% over the prior 12-month period. We signed 19 new contracts in the second quarter that included software licenses greater than $100,000, and those contracts had an average license of $687,000, compared to 19 new contracts with an average license value of $306,000 in the second quarter of 2012.  Our total headcount grew by 25 to 2,431 employees at the end of the second quarter, compared to 2,406 at the end of the first quarter. We currently expect to add approximately a 100 additional employees before the end of the year. Now, I’d like to turn the call back over to John for his additional comments.
John S. Marr Jr.: Thank you, Brian. As you’ve seen, this was a solid quarter and results were generally in line with our expectations. The trend of gradual recovery in the broad local government market environment is continuing. Our new business pipeline is active and our competitive positions and win rates are strong. I like to provide updates on a couple of opportunities that we’ve discussed in recent quarters and discuss our updated guidance for 2013. As we mentioned earlier in the call, our royalty revenues from Microsoft this quarter increased substantially over last year. Royalties totaled $687,000, up from a $129,000 recorded in the second quarter of last year. These royalties were generated by sales of Dynamics AX to approximately 55 public sector entities in 18 different countries. While the royalty revenues were about $200,000 less than Q1, almost half of the royalties in Q1 were from one large sale to a federal agency in Indonesia. This is just our 6th quarter of royalty payments and we continue to be encouraged by the reception of the product in a very broad marketplace as reflected by the number of new deals in the widespread geographical footprint. With respect to our direct channel for Dynamics, late in the quarter, we signed two more significant deals that we had previously mentioned as unsigned awards. The city of Columbus, Ohio, was one of our early Dynamics proposals and selected us after a thorough competitive process. Columbus is the nation’s 15th largest city and we look forward to partnering with them to transform their core financial operations with the implementation of Dynamics along with Tyler proprietary software products and services. We also signed a contract to provide Dynamics to the Oklahoma Administrative Office of the Courts, the statewide agency that provides administrative services for the Supreme Court, Appeals Court and District Courts in that state. Together, those two contracts have initial value of nearly $8 million. Our pipeline of Dynamics opportunities through our direct channel also remains active and growing. In the Courts & Justice market, we continue to build our Odyssey leadership position in case management software. We have been awarded a contract with the State of Washington for statewide implementation of Odyssey and expect that to be signed soon. In California, we have signed contracts for Odyssey with two of the states’ 58 counties following the termination last year of a project to develop a custom statewide case management system. We previously discussed that we were one of three vendors selected earlier this year to enter into a master service agreement under which courts in California can purchase systems without going through the RFP process. The MSA was executed last week and we are actively engaged with several counties that we expect to purchase systems under the MSA. Electronic filing solution for courts known as Odyssey File and Serve is another area in which we are making significant investments and expect to be a growth driver over the next few years. We are well underway with the work on the TexFile project, which is the contract we signed last year to provide a statewide e-filing system for Texas Civil Courts.  e-filing will be mandatory in Texas for civil cases beginning of the largest counties in January of 2014 and then into other counties over a 2.5 year period. The first pilot Court in Great County went live on TexFile with option of e-filing in late June. We are also pursuing a number of additional e-filing opportunities with current Odyssey clients as well as with courts that do not use Odyssey. With each new eFiling contract, we will incur cost ahead of revenues, which may put short-term pressure on margins, as of the case this year. We believe that these with current transaction based revenue streams will contribute significantly to revenues and margin expansion in coming years. This quarter we signed one new eFiling contract with Reno, Nevada Justice Court. Our updated guidance for 2013 is as follows. We currently expect 2013 revenues to be between $411 million and $416 million. We expect 2013 diluted GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $1.08 to a $1.14 and fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be approximately $34.5 million. We expect 2013 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be approximately $1.44 to $1.50. For the year, estimated non-cash share based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $11.5 million. We’re estimating an effective tax rate for 2013 of approximately 40%. We expect that total capital expenditures will be approximately $25.5 million to $26.5 million for the year. Capital expenditures for the year include approximately $17.8 million related to real estate and office facility construction. Total depreciation and amortization is expected to be between $14 million and $14.5 million, including approximately $6.5 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Now, we’ll take your questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Brian Kinstlinger of Sidoti & Co. Please go ahead.
Brian D. Kinstlinger – Sidoti & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you so much. The first question I had, it’s great to hear the MSA was executed in California, I am wondering if any large counties out there have put out RFPs outside of the MSA? And maybe in addition, how many counties you expect might award a contract this calendar year given the MSAs now executed?
John S. Marr, Jr.: No, the larger counties are taking a little slower look at this, although, we do expect them eventually to be in the marketplace. Most of the counties purchasing off the MSA will be small to mid-sized. It’s hard to say how many will do it in this year. We certainly think there are several that will do it relatively soon, but some of the others that are earlier in the process whether or not it gets down through very next year would be hard to say. So certainly several in the next couple of months and whether there is a couple of few more before the end of the year will just be a timing thing to say.
Brian D. Kinstlinger – Sidoti & Co. LLC: Thanks and my second question is, if you look at the two AX deal – Microsoft deal that you won in direct sales, I guess, I’m interested in how long you think it’s going to take implement, or a better way to ask, at what point do these two customers become referenceable clients and are there any more awards that are awarded, but unsigned? 
John S. Marr, Jr.: Well, referenceability is a process. So reference as an installed online client is probably 18 months away for these clients, but I think that the enthusiasm they had for their selection and their support of the kind of best of both worlds approach of Tyler is the leading vertical player in this space and Microsoft is a Tier 1 software company. I think they are referenceable from that respective right now. So we have installed accounts that are online and are referenceable, and then I think to take especially a top 15 City in the country. In Columbus, we did a very thorough search and really can tell that story of having selected kind of the best of both worlds approach will be beneficial even before they are online. Obviously further down the road, it will even be enhanced by that, but will be helpful there. We do not have other awards that we are negotiating in that size range. We do have other small awards back to pipeline, typical smaller or average sized deals. We do have some of those awards that we are working on, but there isn’t a Columbus sized deal award in the contract process at the moment.
Brian D. Kinstlinger – Sidoti & Co. LLC:  Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nathan Schneiderman of Roth Capital. Please go ahead.
Nathan Schneiderman – Roth Capital Partners: Hi, John, and Brian, thanks in advance for taking my questions. I was curious with the New York City tax billing and collection solution, if you could give us more details on just the competitive dynamics of that deal? And then when you look at your pipeline of opportunities within this category of tax billing and collection, are you seeing other significant multimillion dollar deals out there or is this (inaudible) more of a one-off situation?
John S. Marr, Jr.: Yeah, it’s a good question, and I think it goes a little broader than New York. We kind of have two segments in my view of this vertical market. You’ve got core financials and human capital management and the kind of things that clearly are vertical applications, but we also see crossover vendors. Obviously, the Oracles or SAPs or Lawsons and maybe some other names that aren’t as familiar to everybody. We’re always going to have some competition in that space, because it can be a crossover market. We then have what I kind of refer to as the sub-vertical with tax and appraisal, this type of particular opportunity or even Courts & Justice, you’re not going to see crossover vendors. These are vertical only type applications and when you have large enterprise decisions like this, this is a space in the marketplace that traditionally didn’t have these kinds of options and it was a bit underserved. And now there is a company, Tyler, that is large enough, has the scale, has the resources and the stability that is really kind of uniquely qualified to do these large enterprise projects in very vertical types of spaces. And I think that’s why you are seeing us very consistently win these large deals whether it’s in tax and appraisal or in Courts & Justice. So the competitive landscape there is very favorable toward us. I would (inaudible) that there are others that participate in that space, but it tend to be smaller, weaker companies that represent considerable exposure for someone who is doing a $10 million, $20 million or $30 million deal. So this is a place where Tyler trend and stability has emerged as having a significant competitive advantage.
Nathan Schneiderman – Roth Capital Partners: In the tax billing and collection area, do you see other significant multimillion-dollar deals out there or is this really a one-off?
John S. Marr, Jr.: Yes, we do.
Nathan Schneiderman – Roth Capital Partners: And then, a final question for you. When you look at total backlog, 20% year-over-year, when you think about the current portion of that to be recognized over the next 12 months, would you say that’s I know you give us specific number at the end of the year. But would you say it’s roughly of that same percent or did you see any, for example, noticeable mix shift toward either current or toward long-term? Thanks very much.
John S. Marr, Jr.: I think in general, there are more larger contracts in there. So, for example, New York is roughly a three-year implementation as the revenues will be recognized and as we’ve talked about, there’s a – subscription component of that backlog grew 39% year-over-year. So the tenure of that backlog should be a little bit longer than it was, say, at the end of last year. So it is a little bit more falling in the long-term section.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dan Cummins of B. Riley. Please go ahead.
Daniel Cummins – B. Riley & Co.: Thank you very much. I wonder if you could share with us what you can about your hiring plans for the second half of the year, particularly with respect to some of the more recent large contract wins and how that squares with getting to the high end of your earnings guidance? Thank you.
John S. Marr, Jr.: Sure. I think we said in the remarks, we expect to hire about another 100 heads for the end of the year. Many of those are in the billable professional services. We have been doing that throughout the year and that’s another area that as we go back into a little higher growth period is a current investment that puts a little pressure on margins. So the onboarding process depending on the suite of applications and division is three to six months that people are onboard and we are investing in them and they are not productive in terms of revenues yet. So that’s the majority of the positions we are hiring during the year.
Daniel Cummins – B. Riley & Co.:  Yeah. Thanks. That’s helpful. And I guess, with respect to that seasoning process, is it perhaps likely that you won’t really have a strong indicator on getting toward the high end of the range until the fourth quarter?
John S. Marr, Jr.:  I think all of that is baked into the plan, so current projects, if they stay on track. As you saw, we’ve raised the lower end of the range, which suggests that we are tracking towards to the higher end of the range.
Daniel Cummins – B. Riley & Co.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Berg of Northland Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Scott R. Berg – Northland Capital Markets: Hi, John and Brian. Congratulations on this quarter. I guess my first question, Brian, is how is the right way to think of the deferred revenue gain in the quarter, trying to reconcile how much of that might have been from say the New York City deal versus other contracts that were signed in the quarter?
John S. Marr Jr.: I don’t think there are any billings on New York City in the quarter. virtually, all of that is driven by the higher level of maintenance, some of which function comes from EnerGov and the other acquisitions and the majority is just the annual increases on our customers that have July 1 renewals. So most of there it is just organic from new customers brought on there in the last year as well as the rate increases on the existing base.
Scott R. Berg – Northland Capital Markets: Great. and then those as a follow-up, John, on the Dynamics license or the dynamics revenues in the quarter, the royalty is that 687. How should we view those in terms of how much of that is a function of maintenance revenues that you’re getting royalties on versus new license sales? trying to understand how much that’s kind of a run rate going forward in the third quarter given that obviously the difference is there?
John S. Marr Jr.: The run rate on the maintenance right now is a little over $200,000 a quarter, and the difference is on license royalties, and nothing to point out with respect to those new customers with sort of 55 new entities that bought Dynamics in the public sectors through the Microsoft channel. of those 55, the majority of those were upgrades from other Microsoft products about 40 of them were upgrades and about 15 of them were new names. So those upgrades, in most cases, we don’t get a meaningful license royalty at the time of defining, they start getting maintenance royalties, as their maintenance renewals kick in and they jump up. So on a large number of those, there’s not a significant license royalty upfront.
Scott R. Berg – Northland Capital Markets: Great, thank you. I’ll jump back in queue.
Operator: Our next question comes from Charlie Strauzer of CJS Securities. Please go ahead. 
Dan Moore – CJS Securities, Inc.:  Yes, good morning. This is actually Dan Moore filling in for Charlie. Just want to touch on obviously, the housing market starting to, they’re improving steadily. are you seeing, maybe you can elaborate on increased activity in RFPs in the appraisal unit, you touched on a little bit in your prepared remarks, but any additional comments or color would be appreciated?
John S. Marr Jr.: In terms of appraisal services for revaluation, no, not really, that’s a pretty defined cycle; we have a pretty good long-term view on exactly how those things cycle out. We’re kind of in a low point of those cycles, that business will be a little bit stronger in the coming couple of years. But we’d expect that our appraisal service revenues would kind of stay in the $17 million to $21 million or $22 million range over several years going forward. The tax and appraisal, software market is stronger than it’s been. I don’t know if that’s the result of what’s going on in the housing market, but there is a fair amount of activity, New York is certainly outsized here, but there are a number of midsize and good size cities that are active in that process. So we do expect that our software or tech business, I mean, tax and appraisal business will be strong over the next couple of years.
Dan Moore – CJS Securities, Inc.: And then a quick follow-up maybe just talk a little bit about M&A, the trends in terms of opportunities that you are seeing out there?
John S. Marr Jr.: Well, we obviously, just remain opportunistic there. We are very happy with what we have done in the last few years. we’ve certainly raised our standards as we feel we have a portfolio of products in the geographical presence that we wanted to have at this point in our development. So we are more selective with the e-file within that deal EnerGov deal at strategic place are pointing out very nicely in the Infinite Visions deal that few companies associated with that, which represents the majority of our M&A in the last few years are going on very nicely as well. We are not overly aggressive at this point in time. but that’s not to suggest that something even material wouldn’t occur in the future, but currently there really isn’t anything to report on.
Dan Moore – CJS Securities, Inc.:  Okay. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on a very nice quarter.
John S. Marr Jr.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Schappel of Benchmark. Please go ahead.
Mark W. Schappel – The Benchmark Co. LLC: Hi, good morning and again, a nice job in the quarter here. John, in the New York City property tax deal, you’d be dealt two competitors that historically have been pretty strong in that Manatron, CCI. I was wondering if you could just address a little bit more detail, why you think the competitive tides are shifting so dramatically there in the property tax arena?
John S. Marr Jr.: I guess I don’t want to comment too specifically on an individual competitor, other than to say generally that most of our direct competitors are not as strong today as they worked three or five years ago as businesses or as competitive products. And we’re benefiting from that. We’ve discussed before that in 2010 and 2011, this marketplace is pretty tight, many of these companies went through some type of a business combination. and in our case, this cost was taken out or certain investments weren’t increased and we’ve improved our offer in the news areas, and we are satisfied that we’ve gotten good results in terms of a competitive position.
Mark W. Schappel – The Benchmark Co. LLC: Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Raghavan Sarathy of Dougherty. Please go ahead.
Raghavan Sarathy – Dougherty & Co. LLC: Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. First question is a clarification question. So with regards to this New York City deal, was there any sort of appraisal services included in that deal or is there a potential for appraisal service as a follow-on?
John S. Marr Jr.: No, that deal is entirely software professional services and maintenance, perpetual license, on-premise installation and there is not an appraisal services component, and I don’t believe at this time there is any appraisal services contemplated in that jurisdiction.
Raghavan Sarathy – Dougherty & Co. LLC: Okay. and then in terms of the Microsoft deals that you talked about like Columbus and Oklahoma, how does the revenue rec work on this situation as it’s going to be a percentage of completion or how should we think about that?
John S. Marr Jr.: We currently expect that the Columbus deal will be percentage of completion accounting, and that the Oklahoma deal will be more traditional license recognition over – as the licenses delivered in the services on a combinatorial basis.
Raghavan Sarathy – Dougherty & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Ho of William Blair. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Ho – William Blair & Company, LLC: Yes. Just wanted to understand with regards to winning the Columbus deal, what the potential impact could be for, maybe not other sort of tier one cities, but just in terms of the larger tier two cities, this is sort of increased your trustees or give you more of a market, in that, you can reference in terms of a large deal. Just want to get a sense of maybe what this means for the company in terms of that market. 
John S. Marr Jr. : Yeah sure, I think we have had a number of clients with dynamics that are referenced above but having a tier one-type clients that are pretty enthusiastic about their selection that was an important part getting this deal done, so obviously we’ve now that we will be working this deal since the early days of Dynamics release and was considered a very important to get them onboard. I considered on the sophisticated city, have been there myself and met their team and I think that the real resource to us leveraging this in the marketplace.
Jonathan Ho – William Blair & Company, LLC:  Got it, and just in terms of the EnerGov deal, just I want to understand how much of a cross sale opportunity you guys see and sort of a timing that you would expect that to really pick-up at this point?
John S. Marr Jr. : Yeah, that is good pick-up on your part, there are a lot of revenue synergies there. There are small company, and just because become part of Tyler they don’t all of a sudden somehow have all kinds of capacity they didn’t have previously, so we mentioned quickly in the remarks that they’ve done their own direct deals or these, city goes out for that suite of applications on it’s own, that’s what they have done traditionally and they continue to do that on a direct basis with their own resources and are doing well with that.  We mentioned one Incode type deal where we sold EnerGov as well, but I think there were five in the quarter that Incode and Munis were we participated any broader suite of applications and we were able to sell the EnerGov systems along with Munis or Incode. And that’s a benefit for two reasons really obviously that enhances the revenue that EnerGov will do in it’s incremental revenue over what say, they would have done as an independent company, which is the revenue synergy we’re looking for, but secondly, their suite of applications is very, very strong. It shows very well in the demonstrations, it’s very responsive to the RFPs. So we would hope and expect, although it’s very hard to track then it will help us win deals that we otherwise might not have won. It certainly enhances our overall competitive position in the enterprise-wide types of solution. So we’re encouraged that they continue to win business on a direct basis, kind of point solution type decisions, and also that I think five deals that we won without ERP solutions included EnerGov, and we believe that along with selling those apps that made our core offerings more competitive.
Jonathan Ho – William Blair & Company, LLC: Can anyone match you in terms of having that integrated solution with both EnerGov and your “Munis” box?
John S. Marr Jr.,: Well, indeed, (inaudible) presumptuous we hope not that’s the idea, that’s now again, immediately upon doing really did this less than a year ago. So their capacity, the points of integration, the seamless sense of the integration, those things don’t occur overnight. So they’re in process, so currently now if somebody wants to take what they feel is another competitive ERP solution in an industry point type solution for that area, they probably can. But I think right now, people can appreciate that Tyler is going in a direction where over time those products will grow together, the user experience and the integration will be better than what they can get by choosing partners in that type of situation.
Jonathan Ho – William Blair & Company, LLC: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Kinstlinger of Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead.
Brian D. Kinstlinger – Sidoti & Company, LLC: Great, thanks. Just a few questions on eFile 2, the first is the Reno deal that you mentioned you won, is that a county where you have a mandate for Reno for filing or is it just, they can do manual or e-file?
John S. Marr Jr.: I’m not certain that, Reno is mandated at this point or not. It is a county that uses Odyssey as their court solution, that I’m not certain if it’s mandatory at this point.
Brian D. Kinstlinger – Sidoti & Company, LLC:
 :
John S. Marr Jr.: The new really goes in the other order. So as Texas did right, I mean they went out, they selected a solution, selected Tyler and they intended to make it mandatory at some point in time. in the case of Texas, it was made mandatory before the system was actually implemented, which is a good process for us. And there are other states that are out for systems, they generally do not commit to mandatory when they’re out and generally, in the contract process as we become educated in terms of what adoption rates are, when it’s not mandatory, they generally become convinced, that it’s in their interest to go mandatory.  If it’s not mandatory, it really is just a filing system, right. So it’s a more efficient area to file them manually, but if it becomes mandatory, even though there maybe some exceptions virtually all of these documents become electronic, so it’s not just a filing system, it’s a document retrieval systems and they can have confidence that all of this information is online and it will utilized that way in the court rooms by law firms, by the courts themselves. And so it has considerable incremental value to them not just to get a higher percentage filed electronically, but the way the court actually works. In today, many of these courts want to be paper listed, but they want to retire the file cabinets, and storage that they have and this is a way that they become considerably more efficient and most of them become convinced that’s in their interest during the process. So to answer your question, now they are on a life that said, it said hey we are doing mandatory and now we’re looking for a system it usually goes, we’re looking for a system and hence they do their due diligence, they learn that’s in their interest to go mandatory.
Brian D. Kinstlinger – Sidoti & Company, LLC: One last question if I could. Are there any states were you are not installed state-wide for e-file. I think Texas might be the only ones you are where there is a active procurement going on, where you are actively betting?
John S. Marr Jr.: Yes.
Brian D. Kinstlinger – Sidoti & Company, LLC: Can you quantify a number of how many states you are there?
John S. Marr Jr.: I think maybe three.
Brian D. Kinstlinger – Sidoti & Company, LLC:  Great. Okay, thanks so much.  
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Dan Cummins of B. Riley. Go ahead. 
Daniel Cummins – B. Riley & Co.: 
 :
John S. Marr Jr.: Okay. International is not at this point a big part of our focus. We do believe that reinforcing the leadership position we’ve achieved domestically in local government, is important and if there would remain some opportunity cost of redirecting the sales channel, the development group, service group in those areas. Having said that Canada, we consider it’s really more North America than domestic, I should say. Canada is an extension to this market and actually there is a fair amount of Canadian activity across our different applications. But beyond that there is some activity, I think there will be some international business on a direct basis, but your question specifically said significant and I don’t think it will be significant in the next few years and I think that’s disciplined, we feel is important to our really expanding leadership position that we’ve worked to attain. The exception to that obviously is Dynamic. So as we mentioned, I think 55 names, this past quarter and are among the 17 or 18 countries, so that by design was a relationship that we created in addition to distributing that product domestically. We’ll get a lot of international exposure that we wouldn’t have gotten on a direct basis.
Daniel Cummins – B. Riley & Co.: All right, thank you very much.
Operator: At this time there appear to be no more questions. Mr. Marr, I’ll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.
John S. Marr Jr.: Okay, thank you and appreciate you joining us on the call today. If there are any further questions feel free to contact Brian and myself. Have a great day.
Operator:  The conference is now completed. You may now disconnect. Thank you.

Operator: Hello, and welcome to the today's Tyler Technologies’ first quarter 2013 conference call. Your host for today's call is John Marr, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, April 25th, 2013. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Marr. Please, go ahead. 
John Marr: Thank you, Sue. And welcome to our first quarter 2013 earnings call. With me on the call today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like for Brian to give the Safe Harbor statements, next I'll have some preliminary comments, Brian review the details of our operating results, then I'll have some final comments and we'll take your questions. Brian.
Brian Miller : Thanks, John. During the course of this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information, it may include projections concerning the company's future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We refer to you your form 10 K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Please note also that that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. John.  
John Marr : Our first quarter financial performance builds upon improved performance in 2012 and was our ninth consecutive quarter of yearoveryear revenue growth, as well as our 48th consecutive profitable quarter. We had organic growth of almost 12% and total growth of nearly 16%. Our recurring revenues from subscriptions and maintenance continue to be the primary driver of our growth as together they grew almost 20% and represented approximately 62% of total revenue for the quarter. Also, license and royalty revenues were up almost 17% over the last year, primarily because we recorded $891,000 of royalties from Microsoft Dynamics AX sales. We are encouraged by the increase in royalty revenues this quarter, which exceeded the amount recorded for the entire year of 2012.  Averaging our recurring revenues led to an increase gross margins of 60 basis points and our nonGAAP operating margins grew 350 basis points and 19.5% as we held the increase of SG&A expenses and R&D expenses below our overall revenue growth rate. Bookings in the first quarter grew 36% over the last year. New contact signing were solid across all our software products suites while the appraisal services market was somewhat slow. The growth in bookings reflects a continued gradual improve in the broader marketplace. But we believe it is more attributable to the strength of Tyler's competitive position, including our cloud-based offerings. During the quarter we signed an agreement with the State of Rhode Island Judiciary for our Odyssey Integrated Courts and Justice solution. The agreement is valued approximately $6 million and will generate attractive recurring revenues from both maintenance and e-filing. Rhode Island represents our ninth statewide client for Odyssey Our ERP solution had a number of meaningful wins across the country ranging from the City of Palace (inaudible), California to (Inaudible) Florida.  Our EnerGov planning, permitting and licensing solutions which we acquired late last year also has an active pipeline in Q1 contracts where our newest addition include the Cities of Jupiter, Florida and Temecula, California.  Now I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter.
Brian Miller : Yesterday Tyler Technologies reported its preliminary results for the first quarter ended March 31st, 2013.  You've seen the press release and our 10-Q has been filed and so I'm going to comment on some of key metrics for the quarter. Beginning last quarter we added additional nonGAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry.  Our nonGAAP earnings exclude share-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangibles. A reconciliation of GAAP to nonGAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. Also beginning this quarter, we have included the Dynamics royalty revenues in software licenses and royalties line. These were previously included in hardware and other revenue and prior year amounts have also been reclassified for comparability.  Total revenues for the first quarter were $95.8 million, a new quarterly high up 15.8%. Organic revenue growth was 11.5% lead by increases in our recurring revenues from maintenance and subscriptions, as well as growth in our software services revenue. Our acquisitions accounted for revenues of $3.5 million or 4.3 percentage points of growth. Software license and royalty revenues increased 16.8%. Excluding the impact of acquisition, software licenses grew 10.3%, most of which is attributable to the increase in Microsoft Dynamics’ royalties.  Software license and royalty revenue included $891,000 of royalties on public sector sales of Microsoft Dynamics AX by other Microsoft partners compared to $121,000 in last year's first quarter. These royalties are recorded one quarter in arrears as the royalty reports we receive in a given quarter pertain to sales made in the previous quarter. In addition, we had approximately $272,000 of revenues related to Tyler's direct sales of Dynamics, which are included in software licenses and software services. In general license revenue growth continues to be pressured by the increasing percentage of new customers collecting a subscription-based arrangement.  Subscriptions continue to be our fastest growing revenue line and grew 35.2%. Organic growth was 33.7% and the impact of acquisitions added 1.5%. We added 22 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 19 existing installed clients compared to a total of 11 new arrangements and 17 conversions in the first quarter of 2012. Approximately 36% of our new software clients opted for one of our cloud-based solutions compared to 22% of new clients in the first quarter of 2012. The subscriptions line also includes growing revenue streams from transaction-based revenues such as e-filing for courts and online payments. These revenues rose 34.4% to $3 million from 2.2 million last year. We expect to continue to see solid growth in these revenues as both current and new clients adopt our Odyssey file and serve solution and more of them move towards mandatory e-filing. Software services revenues increased 10.4% with 5.9% organic and 4.5% from acquisitions. Organic growth was primarily driven by the higher level of bookings in the recent quarters. Maintenance revenue growth was 15.6% of which 10.5% was organic. Our maintenance revenue growth rate continues to be reduced somewhat by the effect of existing installed clients converting to our hosted offerings, which results in a loss of maintenance revenue offset by a larger increase in subscription revenue. Together our recurring revenues for maintenance and subscriptions comprise 62.1% of our total revenues and grew 19.5%. Appraisal services revenue declined 1.6%. Our blended gross margin for the quarter as 45.8% compared to 45.2% last year. The software license and royalty margin increased 190 basis points primarily due to higher royalty revenues and the blended software services maintenance and subscriptions margin increased 30 basis points reflecting our operating leverage in incremental recurring revenues. However, these increases were offset somewhat by a decline in the appraisal margins. SG&A expense increased 6.1% in the quarter and represented 23.6% of total revenues, a decrease of 220 basis points from last year's first quarter. Non-cash share compensation expense was 2.6 million compared to 1.8 million a year ago. $336,000 was included in cost of revenues and 2.2 million was included in SG&A expense. Net research and development expense was 5.6 million compared to 5.1 million last year. We did not receive any R&D expense reimbursements under our agreement were Microsoft in the first quarter of 2013 or 2012 and we do not expect to receive any further reimbursements under the agreement. Operating income was $14.5 million compared to 10.0 million, an increase of 44.1%. NonGAAP operating income was 18.7 million, up 41.5% from 13.2 million. The nonGAAP operating margin was 19.5% up 350 basis points from 16% last year. Net income was $8.5 million or $0.25 per diluted share compared to 5.7 million or $0.17 per diluted share. The fully diluted share account increased by approximately 1.4 million shares and our effective tax rate 39.9%. NonGAAP net income was 11.5 million or $0.34 per diluted share compared to 7.9 million or $0.24 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2012. Adjusted EBITDA, which is EBITDA plus non-cash share-based compensation expense was $20.2 million or $0.60 for diluted share, an increase of 37% compared to $14.8 million or $0.45 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2012. Free cash flow was $12.0 million compared to $17 million. Excluding real estate CapEx, our free cash flow was 14.9 million versus 17.1 million. Day sales outstanding in accounts receivable of 72 dates at March 31st, 2013, compared to 64 days at March 31st, 2012.  CSOs decreased sequentially from 95 days at December 31st, a normal seasonal pattern as maintenance billing and associated receivables spike in the December and June quarters.  Our backlog at the end of the quarter reached a new high of $386.6 million up 16.4%. Backlog related to our software business, which excludes backlog from appraisal services contracts with 360.9 million at 17.3% increase. Backlog included $111.9 million of maintenance compared to 98.5 million a year ago.  Subscriptions backlog was 97.3 million compared to $67 million a year ago.  Our bookings for the quarter, which are calculated from the change in backlog, plus revenues, were up 36% to $102 million.  For the 12 month ended March 31st, bookings were up approximately 10.8% over the prior 12month period. We signed 11 new contracts in the first quarter that included software licenses greater than $100,000 and those contracts had an average license of $418,000 compared to 12 new contracts with an average license value of 503,000 in the first quarter of 2012. Our total head count grew by 18 to 2,406 employees at the end of the first quarter compared to 2,388 at the end of the fourth quarter 2012. We currently expect to add approximately 180 additional employees before the end of this year.  I'd like to turn the call back over to John for his further comments.
John Marr : Thanks, Brian. This was a solid quarter. Overall results were generally in line with our expectations. A local government market environment is good, although not robust. It appears to be continuing a trend of gradual recovery. As I noted earlier, our competitive position is very strong across our major products and we are very focused on maintaining that market leadership. Next week, over 2,000 Tyler clients will join us in Boston for Tyler Connect 2013, our annual user conference. We expect that this will be our best attended conference to date. Over three days our clients will learn more about Tyler and our products, including our current offerings and our future plans.  The conference includes over 500 classes and product demonstrations that allow our clients to improve their skills as well as many opportunities to interact with other clients, as well as Tyler staff and business partners. At Connect we will hold a session for investors and analysts from 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time to 1:30 p.m. on Monday April 29th. A live and recorded webcast of this session will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website at TylerTech.com. If you're interested in attending in person, please contact Brian Miller to register. While our existing, and in most cases, more mature products are performing very well and are responsible for the majority of the growth we're currently experiencing, there is obviously a great deal of interest among our investors in some of the longer-term growth opportunities. I'd like to provide an update on some of those opportunities and then update our guidance 2013.  As we mentioned earlier in the call as well as on our year-end earnings call in February, our royalty revenues from Microsoft increased substantially this quarter. Royalties totaled $891,000 up from $238,000 recorded in the fourth quarter. These royalties were generated by approximately 27 public sector sales of Dynamics AX in 19 different countries. Almost half of the royalties were from one large sale to a federal agency in Indonesia.  Deals of this size may not occur every quarter. Our history is still relatively short as we only have been receiving royalties for five quarters, but we are encouraged by the increase in the number of customers as well as geographical reach of Dynamics and success in larger deals is something we and Microsoft expect will continue to build. Our pipeline of Dynamics opportunities through our direct channel also remains active and we have two additional awards that are not yet signed, including one of more significant deals that was one of our early Dynamics’ proposal.  Our Courts and Justice business also has some longterm opportunities. We continue to build on our leadership position in case management software with Odyssey and the new statewide contract with Rhode Island signed this quarter. We now have nine statewide court clients and have won every statewide decision since 2010. We also have an active pipeline of opportunities with counties in states that do not have statewide systems.  As we've discussed in some length in prior calls, California has emerged as a market to present some significant longterm opportunity for us. It’s courts in many of it’s states, 58 counties, are expected to replace aging systems following the termination last year of a project to develop a custom statewide case management system. We are now underway with implementation of your first California client, (Inaudible) County. At the end of Q1 we have signed a contract with our second California client, Kings County, which will be SaaS implementation under a fiveyear agreement and also includes transaction-based e-filing.  In addition, we were one of three vendors selected to enter into a master service agreement under which courts in the state can purchase systems without going through the RFP process.  We expect our MSA to be signed in the very near future and are actively engaged with a number of prospects that we expect to purchase systems under the MSA.  We are encouraged by our initial success in California, but we continue to do this as a longterm opportunity that will likely be realized over a number of years. These processes, especially the larger ones, can be lengthy and complicated, and we are investing this year in development efforts related to the California market, as well as incurring costs related to increased sales effort in the state.  Our electronic filing business for courts known at Odyssey File and Serve is another area in which we are making significant investments this year. We are very actively working on the Tex file project, which is a contract we signed last year to provide a statewide e-filing system for Texas courts. By order of the Texas Supreme Court, e-filing will be mandatory in civil cases beginning with the largest counties in January 2014 and then phased into other counties over a two-and-a-half year period. As with most of our new e-filing arrangements, these is will be transaction-based revenues with users paying a per-filing fee to us. We expect to expend more than $3 million this year on Tex File implementation with very limited revenues expected in 2013. However, we expect this contract will provide a longterm revenue stream with more than $15 million annually when fully implemented. We are also pursuing a number of additional e-filing opportunities with current Odyssey clients, as well as with courts that do not use Odyssey. With each new e-filing contract we will incur costs ahead of revenues, which may put shortterm pressure on margins, as is the case this year. We believe these recurrent transaction-based revenue streams will contribute significantly to revenue and margin expansion in the coming years. Our guidance for 2013 is generally consistent with our initial guidance of the year provided in February. We currently expect 2013 revenues to be between 409 and $418 million. We expect 2013 diluted earnings per share to be approximately $1.06 to $1.14 and fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be approximately 34 to 34.5 million. We expect 2013 nonGAAP diluted earnings per share to be approximately $1.42 to $1.50. Over the year estimated non-cash share-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $11.5 million. We estimate an effective tax rate for 2013 of approximately 40%. We expect our total capital expenditures will be approximately 24 to $25 million for the year. Capital expenditures for the year include approximately $15.5 million related to real estate and office facilities under construction.  Old depreciation and amortization is expected to be between approximately 14.2 million and 14.7 million including approximately six and a half million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Now we take your questions.
Operator:  (Operator instructions). The first question comes from Nathan of Roth Capital. Please go ahead. 
Nathan Schneiderman – Roth Capital Partners: Hi, John and Brian. Thanks very much for taking my questions.  Let me just ask a couple of quick ones. John, you said that you feel your competitive position has improved. What specifically can you share with us to make you say that and I'm just curious if for example there's been a change in win rates and if so, to what magnitude are you looking at other data so what can you share with us there? 
John Marr: Sure. This really goes back to, kind of characterize this before that 2010, 2011 were pretty tough years in the market place based on the environment and a lot of companies cut back significantly on their R&D and their investment and some companies literally probably moved from an active new business company to maybe more of a legacy company. A number of companies went through combinations, companies that were acquired or merged into other companies and aren't the same in the new business market. So, while we had very limited growth one year very was pretty much flat one year, low growth in that period of time, we continue to invest and the competitive position of these products reflect that now.  We don't want to necessarily publish our own competitive data entirely, but to answer your question, yes, pretty much across the board our win rates directly against specific competitors that we track and more broadly across the market place have improved. 
Nathan Schneiderman Roth Capital Partners.: And just one follow up, you had mentioned with respect to the California opportunity in the 58 counties that are out there you've went to, but you mentioned that you're actively engaged with others that are considering systems.  I was wondering if you could share with us maybe the number of these counties you're currently engaged with.  I guess the same question more broadly about the E filing opportunity, how many E filing prospects just overall California and otherwise are you engaged with?  And that does it for me with questions.  
John Marr President: : Sure. Well I don't know I can't give you a specific number. Obviously, there's people you've had phone calls with and people you've done demonstrations for they're all prospects, but at different stages, obviously. There's 58 counties, there certainly are tons of them that are ready to make choices, it would be mid to high single digit kind of thing that may be people, obviously (Inaudible) processes and purchasing systems ahead of that and is maybe one or two others that are engaged in processes ahead of the MSA. And again, whatever five to eight that maybe are sitting on the sidelines and waiting for that to get in place so they can utilize that to purchase of systems. So, that may be again eight, 10, 12 that are actively processes at this point in time. Obviously, a good number beyond that are taking longer to get well into the process as would expect in future years.   And then on E filing it's a few. These are all pretty good size deals. All of them individually at least to that division within Tyler move the needle a little bit, but they may be three, four, five meaningful opportunities. I don't think any of them are the Tex File size that's kind of outside deal for us, but all reasonably meaningful on their own.
Nathan Schneiderman Roth Capital Partners.: Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Tim Quillin of Stephens, Inc. Please, go ahead.
Tim Quillin – Stephens, Inc: Good morning. Nice results.  Talk about the Texas E file a little bit more. I guess, first of all, just in terms of the $3 million in spend is that weighted towards any quarter?  And then when you start the first revenue in January how and you mentioned it kind of phases in over two and a half years how exactly does it is it a little bit front end loaded and then a gradual ramp up or kind of how exactly does it phase in?
John Marr:  Yes. Sure. Yes, no question the investment and building up the infrastructure and the team that will support that project. It has clearly started, but heads and capital investments will continue. So it will build somewhat throughout the year. It's in the plan and pretty much as expected. Maybe make that a little more robust since the beginning of year in terms of just the reality that we really see this coming at us pretty quickly. So, but again, mostly in the plan and nothing really new there.  There are some revenues in the plan that you mentioned January. We don't expect it, law offices come to work on January 2nd and just all the sudden start filing things. So, they'll be some ramp up later this year, but that's a little uncertain just how much of that will occur, but we have some revenues in our plan anticipating that, obviously, people will start using the system and easing into it in the latter part of this year.  As we mentioned on the call it's the larger counties that were mandated first. So, yes, it will kind of spike up significantly beginning next year maybe in a ballpark way maybe twothirdsish of what the project ultimately will produce, but that run rate should be pretty much on only a few months into next year that we should be at again maybe a run rate of around twothirds of what they will ultimately produce and then the rest of those small counties will build off the balance over a period of two and a half years.
Tim Quillin – Stephens, Inc.: Got it. And just want to confirm that in terms of numbers that at peek it would be more than $20 million or $20 million plus, so twothirds that you could get in 2014 would be $14 million plus. And then if could you talk about the Microsoft royalties even excluding your largest sale, obviously, you had a big jump up in the levels of royalties. So, encouraging sign, obviously.  So, would you still expect perhaps it could drop down to the 4Q levels or do you feel like you're at a new run rate and feeling relatively good about continued growth from here.  Thanks.  
John Marr : Sure. I think the 20 million would be on the high end of the range that we'd estimate that this would eventually perform at. So, you might want be cautious with that. You might want to use 16 or 18, in fact, back into it from there. I think 20 would be on the high end of the range. In terms of Microsoft deals, yeah, we obviously we'd like that quarter it's certainly not a game changer. We didn't expect it would have an explosion I think we've been cautious to guide people that way. We'd like to see nice gradual building of that. Some quarters will ramp up and it could slide back up a little bit. I think it probably be very disappointed not to say you one have a bad quarter here or there I wouldn't read too much into it, but I think it probably shouldn't fall back to that level. You're building a customer base too, right. So, is recurring revenue now being realized through that so we should start to see a base of even recurring revenue with baseline of new license sales that I think should be consistently above what we saw in Q4. So again, if you see a quarter like that I wouldn't react to it that would be on a very low end of ongoing run rate range if you want to look at it that way. Yes, we're happy with the quarter, because it really included the things we're looking for, a number of customers was significant, the geographical reach was significant, which I mean we've got partners in their own channels engaged around the world really involved in that. And having a single big deal you could say doesn't reoccur necessarily, so I wouldn't necessarily break that number as a run rate, but it is also good to see that this is what we want. Tyler has its own direct business, its own proprietary products, its own channel with Dynamics here and domestically, but winning a significant tier one deal, if you will, against tier one players in geographies that we have absolutely into exposure on our own is part of what we were trying to accomplish with the Dynamics opportunity. So, I think that was the good quarter. It's probably a little hot to think of it as a new run rate, but I would not expect it to fall all the way back to where it was in Q4. 
Tim Quillin – Stephens, Inc.: Right. Good stuff. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Brian Kinstlinger of Sidoti & Company, LLC.
Brian Kinstlinger Sidoti & Company, LLC : Good morning, guys. The first question I had is related to Kings County in California. In general, first of all, is there a mandate at all in Kings County or anywhere in California that we should look at? And do most counties there have viable E filings software or will most also eventually need E filing software in your opinion? 
John Marr : Yes, there is not a statewide or a heavily adopted E filing system. It is not broadly mandated throughout California. And it's not in this first cut of every deal we're looking at. I think a lot of these people have very old systems and they were waiting on the state system. And now that that's not going to occur I think there is going to be a kind of a process with priorities here that they need to get their case management systems replaced. Obviously, these arrangements or these clients change dramatically when E file is involved, so we'll advocate that and encourage it. And I think just have to think that really all major courts in the country will have E filing solutions in years to come, but I think we'll see an order there where some included initially, but some will put it off simply because they have to make it a priority to replace their case management system.  
Brian Kinstlinger Sidoti & Company, LLC : Right. And then I just want to follow up on California, when the MSA gets signed do you think that's going to trigger a handful of counties to hurry to up and make decisions, are they waiting for that?  And then my final question I'm get back in the cue is 180 people you're hiring is that weighted any specific time in the year?
John Marr: I think the MSA I don't want to say its get signed and we take four orders the next day, but yes, I think there are a number of places that we're talking to that just have not run a process because they anticipate ordering off the MSA, so I think they will be a few of those.  Now, so far you've seen the first two deals are not real big counties or real big deals and that seems to be the case. The bigger counties in some of those counties in California are, obviously, as big as some of the statewide deals we've done those are going along at a slower pace. 
Brian Miller: The staffing ramp up most of that is in Q2 and Q2, probably fairly evenly split between those two probably a little more weighted towards Q2 a lot the of Tex File hiring will take place there's plans for Q2. Typically, we don't necessarily get it all done as exactly as it's planned, but it would be pretty heavily waited towards two and three. 
Brian Kinstlinger Sidoti & Company, LLC : Thank you. I'll get back in the cue.
Operator: The next question comes from Scott Berg of Northland Capital Markets. 
Scott Berg – Northland Capital Markets: Hi, John and Brian. Congratulations on a strong bookings quarter. One question for John, one follow up for Brian.  John, on the deal flow on the quarter you made the comment that 36% of your customers chose subscription contract versus only 22% in the first quarter of '12. It's, obviously, a pretty steep jump and even a larger jump in what the second half of '12 saw; in your guidance are you assuming a same type of customer percentage choosing the subscription revenues or is that going to vary from that 35, 36% level throughout the rest of the year?
John Marr: I think the adoption of SaaS and cloud based solutions has moved capital a lot of years we've been operating systems for over 10 years and really hung out in the 10, 15% adoption range for a number of years as you said moving 20 last year and now this particular quarter around 30. It's clearly moving along. Now, whether it says at 30 or drops back, it's gradually, not so gradually building and you would expect that to happen. I would say while we didn't change guidance because we were comfortable within the brackets we have that that adoption is higher than was in our plan. So, the license numbers are a little lower than what we might have expected, but still significantly above last year in the total revenue that's a big part of the reason it was only marginally off expectations, but obviously marginally lower overall revenues somewhat lower revenues in favor of the adoption of SAS. Again, it's running a little ahead of plan, we certainly bed happy if it continues to grow from there and if it slides back I think we are seeing a more sustained adoption of that. The public sector slow to move and embrace these things, but I think we're seeing it although behind the commercial rate it's clearly happening. 
Brian Miller : One thing I would point out too is when we talk about that 36% of new customers that's the number of new named customers. On average the SAS deal tend to be a little more towards the smaller size. So, if you look at the split in the dollar value the new contracts it's more like 26% of the total dollar value is subscriptions versus about 20% last year. So it's not quite as heavily weighted on the dollars as it is on the names. 
Scott Berg – Northland Capital Markets: Great. Thank you for the initial commence there. And then, Brian, on my follow-up, SG&A claim in a little bit lower than what I was estimating at least in the quarter and as a percentage of revenues lower than your last four or five quarters kind of in general; is that kind of new runway for the rest of the year or does the spike in the Texas or the additional hiring kind of drive that up to a higher run rate starting in Q2?
Brian Miller : In terms of revenues to be ramping through the year as well so in terms of absolute dollars we do expect SG&A to ramp during the year, but in terms of percentage of revenues we don't, we expect it to be at a lower rate than last year as we generate some of the we recognize some of the leverage there. Relative to Q4 there were it actually was down a bit. We had a higher incentive comp as sort of the catch up in Q4 of last year that's not there in the first quarter of this year and also some of the marketing expenses are more heavily weighted towards out of the first quarter into the last three quarters. See a little bit of ramp up in absolute dollars as well and commissions were actually lower in Q1 as a result of mix of revenues and people hitting their quotas in Q4 spiked commissions up a bit in Q4. So, as a result Q1 probably a little bit lower than we expect in terms of absolute dollars over the year, but we do expect to see a nice decrease in SG&A percentage of revenues. 
Scott Berg – Northland Capital Markets:  Great thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Daniel Cummins come of B. Riley. Please, go ahead. 
Daniel Cummins – B. Riley & Co.: Thank you very much.  A couple of questions, please. First, I don't know if I heard organic estimate on the growth rate for bookings.
Brian Miller: We didn't break out. 
Daniel Cummins – B. Riley & Co.: Rough numbers of range perhaps.
Brian Miller : I'll get back to you on that in just a second.
Daniel Cummins – B. Riley & Co.: Okay and with respect to the maintenance, the maintenance revenue base, right now how much is related to your court business and how much strength does the maintenance base perhaps get from your momentum in courts? As you said there's about a five point difference between the reported and the organic on the maintenance line, when does that settle down towards the 10 to 11% level?  Thanks. 
Brian Miller : Courts historically have a lower maintenance as a percentage of their total revenue and that is improving as we have these new customers and they come online. And we're seeing significant increase in maintenance in the courts and justice business. Also the acquisitions we've done that we did back in at the end of 2011 with Windsor and then the follow-up acquisition at the beginning of 2012 were more heavily weighted toward maintenance and revenue mix was more heavily in the maintenance field than in the new business market. So, we're still seeing that in the mix of growth there. The new acquisitions in terms of the backlog or the bookings this quarter didn't really add a lot. EnerGov had a couple of deals that were pretty meaningful, but the mix of the new bookings was more organic than the revenues. So, I would say it's more heavily weighted towards organic growth there.
Daniel Cummins – B. Riley & Co.: Fantastic. Thank you, Brian.
Operator: The next question comes from Mark Schappel of Benchmark. Please, go ahead. 
Mark Schappel – Benchmark: Hi. Good morning.  John in the past I believe Tyler was was winning somewhere between 80 to 85% of your competitive court deals. I was wondering if that trend held up in the quarter?
John Marr : Yes. In fact, as we mentioned on the call statewide deals we've been on a run since 2010. So, haven't lost a statewide deal in really haven't lost major county type deals over the last few years. So, it's definitely at least at that run rate now. It could be some smaller deals that we don't scale down into or generally the deals we're not winning are not really in our sweet spot. 
Mark Schappel – Benchmark: Okay. And with respect to your courts business what is that running with as percentage of total revenue?
John Marr : About right at about 15 %.
Mark Schappel – Benchmark: 15% of total revenue.
John Marr: Right.
Mark Schappel – Benchmark: Thank you. That's all for me. 
Operator: The next question comes Jonathan Ho of William Blair. Please, go ahead.
Jonathan Ho William Blair & Company: Hey, guys.  Just want to start out with the California deals in terms of the MSA did the larger counties tend to use something like an MSA or potentially do their own process? Just want to get a sense of whether we should look at the MSA as more sort of the smaller counties or whether at all related to county size? 
John Marr : I would say the larger counties may use it, but yes, they would be more likely to run their own process and have specific needs that they want to address outside of that. The smaller counties are more likely to utilize it, they're watching closely the decisions that have been made and how those projects are going and in some cases they may even coordinate with one another to more regionally do things. California has got huge differences in the counties. I think Kings County is 150,000 people, obviously, they have counties that have many million people in them. So the smaller end is more likely to leverage MSA, as well as potentially pull in some groups that do some regional things par bar.
Jonathan Ho William Blair & Company: And just in terms of trying to model some of the expenses just wondering for Brian whether Tyler Connect is going to add any additional cost this quarter or whether we should be looking at any sort of unusual spending related to events this year that might shift from last year?
Brian Miller : No, it would be similar to last year. Connect falls in the hardware and other both in both the revenues and the expenses and so you saw that spike last year of a couple million dollars from Q1 to Q2 in the cost of hardware and other and I think you'll see something similar this year.
Jonathan Ho William Blair & Company: Great. Thank you. 
Operator: The next question comes from Raghhavan Sarathy of Dougherty & Co. Please, go ahead.
Raghhavan Sarathy – Dougherty & Co.: Thanks for taking my questions. Couple questions.  Brian, when I looked at the maybe what you call significant size deals more than 100,000 you signed 11 in this quarter, which was 12 last year even the average size is down yearonyear. Yet even new bookings are up 36% yearonyear. You can talk about some (inaudible ) bookings to this year compared to last year? 
Brian Miller : Yes, the biggest deal this quarter there weren't neither quarter had a really large like an Oregon or Maryland size deal in it, but the biggest deal this quarter was the Rhode Island statewide courts deal, which was around six million otherwise it was just really a lot of strength in, I guess what I would call, midsize deal primarily, deals anywhere from a few hundred thousand to a couple million. And so, it was more volume related than buys related. And then as we said we doubled the number of subscription based deals, so 22 cloud deals went in as well. And then also in the bookings number we're seeing a growing number that don't actually show up as new clients, but of renewals of SAS deals. So as we have deals that have been there finished up their initial threeyear, fiveyear arrangement we're see renewals of those into additional terms and those come from bookings as well, but don't fall into that either of those client count numbers of new clients. 
Raghhavan Sarathy – Dougherty & Co.: Okay. And then in terms accounts receivable looks like AR remains elevated and I was wondering what was driving AR growth faster than revenue growth?
Brian Miller : AR actually went up a few days compared to the same quarter last year. It's really multirelated to primarily related to the acquisitions we have a higher level of maintenance billings that happened this quarter and so, when you have an elevated maintenance billings you get the receivable, but you don't have the corresponding revenues that go with that so it bumps your DSO's up a bit with we'll see those collections next quarter. We also had a couple of larger deals where we had more significant upfront cash collections where we had I'm sorry, cash billings where we were able to bill larger deposits up front, because of the terms of the contracts. Those weren't collected yet, but were billed during the quarter and again, be expected to be collected next quarter, but there's a billing without a corresponding revenue component, so it's not really an aging issue it's more the nature of the billings that we saw this quarter.
Raghhavan Sarathy – Dougherty & Co.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Once again if would you like to ask a question please press star then one.  Follow up question now from Brian Kinstlinger of Sidoti. Please, go ahead.  
Brian Kinstlinger Sidoti & Company, LLC: Brian, can you remind us last year what E filings total transitional revenue was and maybe what you estimate it will be this year? Based on your guidance. 
Brian Miller: For the full year last year we finish the quarter E filing was at a run rate of a little over $6 million, the fourth quarter was around a million and a half. This year Q1 E filing was about a million seven. So we're on a run rate of a little that's than seven million. We do expect it to grow during the year. It's a little uncertain in terms of how the timing of these things kick in, particularly with some of the ones that are moving towards becoming mandatory. As I mentioned we have a little bit of Texas in there, but it's certainly a number that's less than $10 million it's in our plan for this year.
Brian Kinstlinger Sidoti & Company, LLC: Can you explain do you have a dedicated sales force or is it just an extension now of Odyssey or any courts team?  And then separately, John, if you can comment in the many years I've followed you guys buybacks have been very aggressive for the company and we haven't seen them in a little bit so maybe talk about if that's something the board is evaluating right now will you get more aggressive do you think this year?  Thanks.
John Marr : Sure. E filings are done with the regular court channel so courts is an independent channel for us.  The case management Odyssey people as well as Odyssey filings is done pretty much with the same people. The acquisition we did a couple years ago which was (inaudible) net they brought with them what we call our product specialist, so they do the different people do the demonstrations and when you drill into the details but the channel and the sales management are the same people. The buybacks, obviously, we're thrilled we were as aggressive as we were when stock was at a lower value and fortunately, we did enough of it actually went into debt a little bit, done a number of acquisitions over the last couple of years as well, purchase and built some real estate, so deployed a lot of capital, got a little bit in debt which was fine, obviously, not highly leveraged in relation to our numbers. And now we're out of debt and starting to accumulate some cash, but certainly not at a point where we have to have more urgency in terms of deploying capital. So, I think while we certainly appreciate the reasons why our stock has gone up significantly and agree that those catalysts have significant value I think where we are right now we won't be very aggressive at these levels.
Brian Kinstlinger Sidoti & Company, LLC.: Great, thanks so much.
Operator: Next you have a question from Raghhavan Sarathy with Dougherty & Co. 
Raghhavan Sarathy Dougherty & Co. : Yes. Thanks for taking my follow-up questions. You might have mentioned this when do you expect to sign this MSA with the California Sacramento managers association? 
John Marr : We simply said very soon. We don't control the process in the coming weeks we'd expect that that would be executed.
Raghhavan Sarathy Dougherty & Co. : Okay. And then one follow up for, Brian.  Brian, can you give us some sense, I know you kind of classified this segment a little differently, but give us some sense for the growth rates of different segments of the business and then the enterprise after business segment justice I guess you know.
Brian Miller : We really don't get into breaking out the segment into subsegments too much. We have said that we were expect that courts and justice over the next couple of years would be faster growing. The other business units the ERP side is much mature has a lot more scale now it's harder to move the needle as quickly. And particularly with the E filing opportunities in some of the things we've talked about with respect to courts we expect that to grow faster, but if not explosive kind of growth. The schools business continues to be school specific products continues to be a bit more challenging market in terms of competitive landscape and so that business is growing a bit slower. And the ERP business is growing generally in line with our overall growth rates. 
Raghhavan Sarathy Dougherty & Co. : Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it. 
Operator: At this time there appears to be no more questions. Mr. Marr, I'll turn the call over to you for closing remarks.  
John Marr: Okay. Thank you, Sue. And thank you all for joining us on the call today.  If there are any further questions feel free to contact Brian or myself. Have a great day.

John S. Marr, Jr. : Our fourth quarter financial results were solid and in line with our expectations. This was our eight consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. And we again, had double-digit organic growth of nearly 11%, in total growth of over 16%. We were very pleased with the performance of our recent acquisitions. The Infinite Visions Product businesses, which include Windsor, UniFund, and CSA, performed well in 2012, and we’ve made substantial progress in consolidating those three organizations into Tyler.  Our most recent acquisition was EnerGov, was only included in our results for one month of 2012, but we are very excited about both the product and the people that have joined Tyler from EnerGov. At the end of November, we completed the acquisition of EnerGov Solutions. They are a leading provider of enterprise, permitting, land management, licensing, and regulatory software solutions to government agencies. EnerGov was founded in 2002, and is based near Atlanta, Georgia. This acquisition broadens our portfolio of Citizen Services software solutions, by complementing our Munis and Incode product suites, with industry leading land use and community development solutions. EnerGov was selected in 2009, at the Esri World Partner of the year, and received the 2012 Esri Mobile App of the year award. EnerGov has clients in 31 states, and had approximately $9.5 million in revenue in 2012. The purchase price for EnerGov was approximately $10 million in cash, and $2.8 million in Tyler stock. Our recurring revenues from subscriptions and maintenance continue to be the primary driver of our growth, as together they grew 22% and represented approximately 61% of total revenues for the quarter. The trend of gradual improvement in our marketplace that we’ve discussed in recent quarters, appears to be continuing. However, we believe that our strong competitive position is the bigger factor in our growth, as we are seeing the results of the increased investments in product development we made, during the very challenging new business environment years of 2010 and 2011. Some of our notable recent contract signings include the Texas Office of Court Administration, selecting our Odyssey File and Serve E-Filing offering for text file. A unified statewide electronic filing system for courts that will reduce the cost for filers, while providing a robust platform for the expansion of electronic filing in Texas. In addition, the state of Oregon has begun implementing our electronic filing solution on a transaction revenue based model as well. Oregon selected our Odyssey Court Case Management system in 2010 for statewide implementation supporting all state trial courts.  Odyssey has all ready been successfully implemented in Yamhill, Cook, Jefferson, and Linn counties. The rollout of Odyssey to Oregon’s remaining circuit courts will continue through 2016. The Superior Court of California, County of San Luis Obispo, signed a contract for our Odyssey system as the single integrated software for managing court information and operations within the San Luis Obispo Superior Court.  I’ll discuss both our eFiling business and the opportunity in California courts in more detail later in the call. We signed two new clients for Microsoft Dynamics AX, through our direct channel during the fourth quarter, including Walker County, Texas, and the Maricopa County Association of Government in Arizona. I’ll also have more to say regarding this later in the call.  New clients for our Munis RT solutions include the city of Naples, Florida, Ellsworth, and Mt. Desert, Maine. Ellsworth is a traditional on-premise, and Mt. Desert signed a 10 year access agreement. The city of Santa Barbara and Beverly Hills, were both significant contracts in California, where we continue to win a meaningful amount of new business. We also achieved a significant milestone where our Munis system is used by all of the school districts in the state of Kentucky. In the fourth quarter, we completed the conversion of 173 school districts to our hosted solution from an on-premise installation. In Texas, we signed a contract with almost $3 million with the city of Dallas, the nations ninth largest city for our Incode Municipal Court Case Management Solution. The city of Mesquite, which is also in the Dallas area, and is the state’s 18th largest city, will also implement our Municipal Court Solution. In Mississippi, Jackson, the states capital city selected our Incode local government solution, including Criminal Court Case Management and Document Management applications. In the city of Gulfport, a long time client, added our public safety solution. Significant signings for our CLT Appraisal Services include Cobb County, Georgia, with a five year $4.3 million contract for residential appraisal services, in Clermont County, Ohio. Finally, in December, we signed an agreement valued at more than $2 million with Harford County, Maryland, for our recently acquired EnerGov planning, permitting, and licensing solution. Now I’d like for Brian to provide more detail on the results of the quarter.
Brian K. Miller:  Yesterday Tyler Technologies reported it’s primarily results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2012. These results are considered unaudited until our Form 10-K is filed, which is expected to be on February 20. I’m going to provide some additional data on the quarter’s performance, then turn the call back to John for his additional comments on the current quarter, and our outlook for 2013. Beginning with this quarter, we have added additional non-GAAP measures that we believe will facilitate understanding of our results, and comparisons with peers in the software industry. Our non-GAAP earnings excluded share base compensation expense, and amortization of acquired intangibles. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, is provided in our earnings release. Revenues for the fourth quarter were 95.4 million, a quarterly high and up 16.2%. Organic revenue growth was 10.9%, led by increases in our recurring revenues for maintenance subscriptions, as well as growth in our software services revenue. Our acquisitions of Windsor, UniFund, CSA, and EnerGov accounted for revenues of $4.3 million, or 5.3 percentage points of growth. Software and license revenues declined 11.2%, excluding the impact of acquisitions, software licenses declined 18.9%. This is due in part to the mix of contracts, as the current quarter had several contracts with significant service components, which are recognized over a longer period, as well as the greater proportion of the new clients who choose a subscription based arrangement, versus the perpetual license.  Subscriptions continue to be our fastest growing revenue line, and grew 42.9%. Organic growth was 40.5% and the impact of acquisitions was 2.4%. We added 29 new subscription base arrangements, and converted 15 existing installed clients, compared to a total of 9 new arrangements and 12 conversions in the fourth quarter of 2011. Approximately 45% of our new software customers opted for one of our Cloud base solutions, while 55% purchased the deployed solution with an associated perpetual software license. The subscriptions line also includes the growing revenue stream from transaction base revenue such as eFiling for Courts, and online payments. These revenues rose approximately 50% to $3.0 million from $2 million last year. We expect to continue see solid growth in these revenues as both current and new customers adopt our Odyssey Filing and Serve Solution, and more of them move towards mandatory eFiling. Software Service revenues increased 22.2%, with 18.7% organic, and 3.5% from acquisitions. Organic growth was primarily driven by the ramp-up of work associated with the implementation of contracts signed in the recent quarters, including the Oregon and Maryland Courts contracts. Maintenance revenue growth was 16.9%, of which 10.1% was organic. Together our recurring revenues from maintenance and subscriptions comprised 61.1% of our total revenues, and grew 21.7%. And finally, appraisal services revenue increased 4%.  Other revenues included $238,000 of royalties on sales of Microsoft Dynamics AX, by other Microsoft partners in the third quarter. These royalty’s are recorded one quarter in arrears, as the royalty reports we receive in a given quarter, pertain to activity from the previous quarter. In addition, we had approximately $256,000 of revenues related to Tyler’s direct sale of dynamics, which are included in licenses and services. For the full-year, our total royalty revenues were $756,000 and direct revenues were 840,000 for a total of approximately $1.6 million. Our blended gross margin for the quarter was 46.8% compared to 47.5%. The blended software services, maintenance and subscriptions margin increased 50 basis points reflecting our operating leverage in incremental recurring revenues. However, this was offset by declines in software licenses and appraisal margins. SG&A expense increased 7.7% in the quarter, and represented 23.9% of total revenues. A decrease of 190 basis points from last year’s fourth quarter.  Non-cash share compensation expense was $1.9 million compared to 1.7 million last year. 293,000 was included in the cost of revenues and 1.6 million was included in SG&A expense. Net research and development expense more than doubled to $5.4 million. We did not receive any R&D expense reimbursement under our agreement with Microsoft in the fourth quarter of 2012, versus 2.2 million of reimbursement in the fourth quarter of 2011. We do not expect to receive any further reimbursements under the agreement. Operating income was $15.4 million compared to 14.3 million, or an increase of 7.7%. Non-GAAP operating income was 18.9 million, up 9.7% from 17.3 million, and our non-GAAP operating margin was 19.9%. Net income was 9.4 to 11.3 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, compared to 8.7 million or $0.27 per diluted share. The fully diluted share count increased by approximately 1.4 million shares. Our effective tax rate was 37.6%. Non-GAAP net income was 11.8 million or $0.35 per diluted share, compared to 10.8 million or $0.34 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2011. Adjusted EBITDA, which is EBITDA plus non-cash share base compensation expense, was 20.3 million or $0.61 per diluted share, compared to 18.8 million or $0.59 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2011. Free cash flow was 13.7 million, up 52.2% compared to 9 million last year. Excluding real estate CapEx, our free cash flow was 14.9 million versus 9 million last year. For the full-year of 2012, our total revenue was 363.3 million, an increase of 17.4% compared to 309.4 million for 2011. Recurring revenues for the full-year grew 21.8% and comprised 59.6% of total revenue. Net income for the year was 33.0 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, compared to 27.6 million or $0.83 per diluted share for 2011. Non-GAAP net income for the year was 42.4 million or $1.29 per share, an increase of 20.5% compared to 35.2 million or $1.06 per diluted share for 2011. Adjusted EBITDA for the year was 76.1 million, compared to 62.9 million in 2011.  Day sales outstanding in accounts receivable was 95 days at December 31, 2012, an improvement of 4 days, compared to 99 days at December 31, 2011. DSOs increased sequentially from 75 days at September 30, which is a normal seasonal pattern, as maintenance billings, and associated receivables spike in June and December quarters. Our backlog at the end of the quarter reached a new high at 380.6 million, up 12.0%. Backlog related to our software business, which excludes backlog from appraisal services contracts, was a record 350.6 million, a 9.6% increase. Backlog included 125.5 million of maintenance, compared to 110.3 million a year ago. Subscription backlog was 82.1 million, compared to 66.8 million last year. We currently expect to recognize approximately 42 million of the subscription backlog in 2013. Our bookings for the quarter, which are calculated from the change in backlog plus revenues, were down 4.1% to 118 million. Bookings for the fourth quarter of 2011 included approximately $29 million from the Odyssey Court contract with the state of Maryland. For the 12 month ended December 31, bookings were up approximately 10% over the prior 12 month period. We signed 18 new contracts in the fourth quarter that included software licenses greater than 100,000. And those contracts had a average license of $493,000, compared to 14 new contracts with an average license value of 866,000 in the fourth quarter of 2011. Excluding the state of Maryland contract in last years fourth quarter, the average license value for Q4 of 2011, was 474,000. Our total headcount grew by 112 to 2,388 employees at the end of the fourth quarter, compared to 2,276 at the end of the third quarter. The acquisition of EnerGov added 70 new employees. Now, I’d like to turn the call back over to John, for his further comments.
John S. Marr, Jr.:  Thank you, Brian. As you can see, we returned to solid growth in 2012, after two years of a weak new business environment, and earnings for the year were generally in line with our expectations. I’ll detail our guidance for 2013 shortly, but first, I’d like to discuss in a little more detail some of our long-term opportunities, and our plans for this year as we prepare to build on those opportunities. As you’ll see, we entered 2013 with expectations of another year of double-digit revenue growth, but our range of earnings growth and the implied margins associated with those earnings reflect some cost in margin pressure. On a GAAP basis, share base compensation expense will increase significantly. While it is added back for non-GAAP income, share base compensation expense is expected to increase from 7.4 million in 2012, to approximately $10.5 million in 2013. While we are reducing the number of options granted under our regular semi-annual grants, our very strong stock performance over the years has driven up the book expense. Much of the additional cost in margin pressure is due to the investment we’re making in 2013, in advance of opportunities we believe will accelerate revenue and margin growth in 2014 and beyond. While margins will be relatively flat in 2013, it remains reasonable to assume that they will generally expand over time, even if not in a straight line. One of the most significant of these investments is related to our electronic filing business, known as Odyssey File and Serve. This product allows attorney’s to file documents electronically with courts, providing significant efficiencies and cost savings for both the filers and the courts. Most of our new eFiling contracts generate transaction based recurring revenues, where we provide the solution with little or no upfront cost to the courts, and earn revenues from filing fees. As a result, we generally incur implementation cost associated with the new contracts up front, and then build a stream of recurring revenues as eFiling volumes build. Generally we look for the courts to make eFiling mandatory, in order to increase adoption, and achieve volumes that generate stronger margins. As of the end of 2013, we have transaction based eFiling agreements that are currently generating revenues with only a handful of clients, three counties in Nevada and Michigan, in the states of Minnesota and New Mexico. As I mentioned earlier, we have recently signed statewide eFiling contracts with the states of Oregon and Texas. In Oregon, we don’t currently have eFiling revenue, but the courts expect to mandate eFiling in each County, approximately six months after they go live on the Odyssey system. In Texas, there is not a statewide court case management system, but we were awarded the statewide eFiling contract in November. The new [inaudible] system operated by Tyler, will replace a outdated existing system, which is expensive for user and capacity constrained, and eFiling is not currently mandatory anywhere in the state. Very recently, the Texas Supreme Court, issued an order mandating eFiling in civil cases, beginning January 1, 2014. Mandatory eFiling will be phased in over a 2.5 year period, beginning with the largest counties in January of 2014. We will be paid on a per filing basis. We expect to see very limited revenues from [inaudible] during 2013. During the coming year, we will invest significantly in the range of $3 million as we prepare to implement the system with courts across the state. However, with the recent order mandating eFiling in Texas, we expect that this contract will provide a long-term recurring annual revenue stream of 15 to $20 million, when it becomes fully mandatory. We are actively pursuing a number of additional eFiling opportunities, both with courts that are currently using Odyssey, and those that are not. With each new eFiling contract, we incur cost ahead of revenues, which can contribute to lumpy margin expansion. We believe that these recurring revenue streams are extremely valuable, and that this part of our business will contribute significantly in the coming years. Now a relatively new opportunity that we’ve discussed in the last couple of quarters is in the California courts market, which arose out of the termination early last year of a project to build a statewide custom case management system. We are now seeing more activity in that marketplace. As I stated in the opening remarks, we have been awarded the first decision to have signed a contract with the courts in San Luis Obispo County for our Odyssey Court Case Management System.  Tyler was also one of the three vendors recently selected in California, to enter into a master service agreement, under which courts in the state can purchase systems without going through the RFP process. We are beginning to be engaged with a number of prospects that we expect to purchase the system under the master agreement.  While we continue to believe that the courts in California represent a great opportunity for which we are well positioned, we view this as a long-term process that will likely play out over a number of years.  These processes, especially the larger ones, can be lengthy and complicated, and we currently do not anticipate additional new contracts, that will contribute meaningfully to revenues before 2014. We will however be investing in development efforts in 2013, related to the California market, as well as cost related to increase selling efforts in the state. Finally, California is not the only state we are competing for courts business, and we have a very active pipeline for Odyssey across the country. I’d also like to add some color to our Microsoft Dynamics AX business. We started the year with very limited visibility on Dynamics business. Although we had no history on which to base our expectations for the year 2012, we did not expect the revenue contribution for the year to be meaningful. Given the typically long sales cycles and the public sector market, we are not particularly surprised by the slow ramp-up of Dynamic sales. As you know, there are basically two channels from which we earn revenues related to Dynamics product. First, there’s that direct sales channel. As we’ve previously discussed, our launch customer, the city of Redmond, Washington, went live with the product in July of 2011, and continues to be a strong reference. We announced two Tyler direct deals in the second quarter, and both of those clients are now live. In the fourth quarter, we signed two additional direct deals that I mentioned earlier, Walker County, Texas and Maricopa County Association of Government in Arizona. In addition, we had two additional awards that are not yet signed, including one more significant deal, it was one of our early dynamic proposals.  We are encouraged by those awards and have a active pipeline of prospects that we are targeting with dynamics.  The second channel is from the Microsoft partners. We received royalties on both licenses and maintenance from dynamic sales in the public sector worldwide. We have very limited visibility into those partner channels, and record the royalty revenues a quarter in arrears. These revenues have grown slowly in the first four quarters, and royalties recorded in Q4 from sales in Q3 were actually slightly lower than the prior quarter. The royalty’s recorded in Q4, however, represent sales in 12 different countries, and we are pleased with the geographical diversity of the partner channel, as well as by the run rate of recurring revenues. In addition, a number of sales by Microsoft partners have been upgrade from other Microsoft products, which do not carry an initial license royalty, but will learn maintenance royalty’s for Tyler. Since this year end earnings report is a few weeks later than our normal quarterly earnings, we have all ready received the royaty report for Q4, which will be recorded in Q1. Those revenues are considerably higher than the last quarter, and represent sales in 22 different countries. While we are encouraged by the increase and activity reflected in the Q4 report, we expect that revenue through the channel may vary from quarter-to-quarter, until the base grows large enough for steady trends to develop. We entered 2013 with a strong competitive position, a record backlog of business, and a business environment that appears to be continuing to trend in the right direction. With our growing backlog and positive outlook across the company, we are adding staff to ensure that we are well positioned to deliver on the new business levels. Excluding the EnerGov acquisition, we added 79 people in the second half of 2012, and our plans call for a net addition of approximately 200 people in 2013, primarily in development and professional services. While we carefully managing staffing additions, to insure that they are appropriately timed and in line with our business, the additions do put pressure on margins in the short-term, until these people are fully productive and generating revenues. Our guidance for 2013 reflects those trends, as well as our continued investment in our products and business, that we believe will enhance long-term growth and margin expansion. 2013 guidance is as follows. We currently expect 2013 revenues to be between 409 and $418 million. We expect 2013 diluted earnings per-share to be approximately $1.06 to $1.14, and fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be approximately 34 to 34.5 million. We expect 2013 non-GAAP diluted earnings per-share to be approximately $1.42 to $1.50. For the year, estimated non-cash share base compensation expense is expected to be approximately $10.5 million. We estimate an effective tax rate for 2013 of approximately 40%. We expect our total capital expenditures will be approximately 23 to $24 million for the year. Capital expenditures for the year include approximately $14.8 million, related to real estate and office facility construction. Total depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately 14.2 to $14.7 million, including approximately $6.5 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Now we’ll take your questions.
Operator:  (Operator instructions). 
Operator:  At this time, we'll begin the question and answer session. (Operator instructions).  And our first question comes from Nathan Schneiderman from Roth Capital. Please go ahead with your question.
Nathan Schneiderman – Roth Capital Partners: Hi, John and Brian. Thanks for taking my questions. It does sound like the eFiling initiative for courts is becoming pretty exciting. You referenced in your discussion opportunity on the Oregon side with eFiling. But I just wanted to clarify your initial $30 million dollar plus deal with Oregon. Did that anticipate eFiling revenues as part of that $30 million? Or would this be an incremental opportunity? And if it's incremental, could you scope it just in general or relative to the Texas deal?
John S. Marr, Jr.:  No, it's part of the $30 million. And that really raises a point that should be clarified. Since these contracts are for a licensed or a professional service, it's a click type thing. They're never really any base contract. They don’t necessarily guarantee us this. And therefore, they're also not in backlog. So as TX file for example ramps up, even though as the mandatory counties come online, we see that ramping up to whatever, $15, $18 million. It will never be in backlog or part of the base agreement. So no, it wasn’t part of the $30.  That's a hard one to read because it's county by county after the counties go live. And I really don’t have any parenthesis for you on what that volume will be. We'll try to get that as it comes forward.
Brian Miller:  The volume on that is I think about a half million filings a year. And as John said, that will ramp up over time. But so it's more in the $3 million annual run rate. It's not nearly the volume that Texas has.
Nathan Schneiderman – Roth Capital Partners: And then can you clarify as well? Did the $45 million Maryland deal anticipate – or I guess eFiling was not a part of that. Do you expect to get eFiling business there? And what would the size of that opportunity be relative to the Texas deal?
Brian Miller:  We do expect to have eFiling in Maryland. It's not contracted yet. We're still in discussions. Maryland is still a fair ways away from being live and ready for eFiling. We do expect it will be on a transaction base. But it's not finalized. And so we don’t really have terms there. It is a much smaller state than Texas. And so the volumes would be significantly smaller.
Nathan Schneiderman – Roth Capital Partners: And then final question area for me, just on the court's license revenue at 1.5 million, a year ago, it was 1.9. And you have these $75 million of wins with Oregon and Maryland combined. When does that really start to flow into the license fee on the income statement in a meaningful way? And just why is the ramp so slow there? Thank you.
John S. Marr Jr. : We don’t expect that number to explode even though the contracts are significant and the growth in the business is significant. Sometimes what's in the contract doesn’t run through that revenue line. Anything that's carved out for professional services or any other place, maintenance, all comes out of the license fee. And that line does stay as you've seen kind of stubbornly flat as the other things grow.  Certainly, the strategy we have for the courts division is that as we benefit from these large contracts and certainly, they have a significant market opportunity there, we're much more focused on what the business looks like after we execute those contracts than during it. So the licenses will not grow as dramatically as one might think. And again, as we have to make choices in the structure of contracts and arrangements and negotiations, we will always be more focused on what the customer will look like after that initial implementation.  So we will see growth in that line. But it won't be anywhere near the growth you'll see in maintenance in the eFiling and the lesser degree of the professional services.
Nathan Schneiderman – Roth Capital Partners: Got it, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Kintslinger from Sidoti and Company. Please go with your question.
Brian Kintslinger – Sidoti & Company:  Yeah, great to follow up on that last question. Thanks. On the software license, where are your expectations built into that line item for 2013 based on your guidance? And if it assumes any real growth double-digit, I guess what's the basis for that if we don’t expect to see that on the court's line?
John S. Marr Jr. : Yeah, and obviously, that's the hardest line to predict for a number of reasons. Obviously, much of the other businesses recurring has very high visibility. As you know, we have hardly any turnover in those lines. They are generally predicted on a very narrow range. And historically, we've been very accurate with those.  Licensing is difficult for two reasons. One is it's just hard to predict the timing of new business and the volume of new business. And then obviously, it's been complicated further for a good reason in recent years, which is that it's hard to predict how much of it's going to be SaaS or hosted recurring models, which we prefer to new license and traditional licensing arrangements.  All that said, we do have a fair amount of license growth in this year's budget. We won't do the breakdown dramatically. But certainly, double-digit and probably more in the 20% to 30% range. Some of that is acquisition obviously.  EnerGov is a new business. And still does a fair amount of traditional licensing. And their model is a newer company. A younger company is more business oriented in existing company and recurring revenue oriented. So they bring some of that. And there's still a tail on some of the acquisitions that weren't in all year last year. So probably about half of that growth is from acquired divisions, which really isn't growth. And then we do see growth across the different product lines as well.  So we do have in our plan more in the range of 20% to 30% license growth.
Brian Kintslinger – Sidoti & Company: Okay, and then thanks, on the eFiling, are there any of your existing customers that you can share with us that are deep into the Supreme Court process of mandating eFiling? I mean that's really the driver of this volume, not just actually signing up clients obviously. So maybe update us on the legislative landscape.
John S. Marr Jr. : Yeah, no, we've shared with you the ones that we thought have made that decision or far enough for us to do that. I want to be as transparent as I can with you folks. But I also don’t want to obviously get overly involved in ongoing decision processes and put things out ahead of what our clients are doing. But we thought that the Texas deal was significant enough that we should provide a lot of details in that. We have Oregon.  And I think certainly as we said, there are other states, other counties that we're actively engaged in. We do think this is an exciting part of our business. But I'm going to hesitate to get too granular with people that are still in the process. 
Brian Kintslinger – Sidoti & Company: Great, I'll get back in the queue. Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Tim Quillin from Stephens, Incorporated. Please go with your question.
Tim Quillin – Stephens Inc.:  Hi, good morning. In terms of the implied margin guidance of roughly flat in 2013, can you talk about any specific cost drivers on that? You mentioned eFiling. Are there specific costs with the build-out of Texas that you could highlight? And then how much in terms of pursuing the California opportunities, how much of an increase in sales expenses would you expect?
John S. Marr Jr. : Sure, probably three specific things. And one of the reasons we've included non-GAAP guidance for the first time, stock compensation is up about $3 million year-over-year. We're committed to keeping the number of options we grant proportionately in line with the outstanding shares. Those will be coming down since we've repurchased a lot of shares in the last three years. Not the last year, but over a period of time. But the value of volatility of the stock have driven the cost per unit up significantly. So that's significant. New acquisition intangibles is significant as well as we did four somewhat meaningful acquisitions in the last 18 months.  And then the textile thing itself, but also that as an example of the way our business does work. I think we indicated in the comments that that's about $3 million ahead of revenues. And that's a significant deal that by itself, we can appreciate that number, put some pressure on earnings.  But whether it's Oregon or other states, we're hiring people and creating teams and infrastructure to deliver on traditional deals that deliver on these [inaudible] filing and other hosted type deals. There's a range of investments we're making. California is kind of anecdotal. That is not a $3 to $4 million number by itself. But it's another example of the great opportunity. There are some investments we should make in the product to have California specific extensions ready for our presentations and these implementations ahead of the deals. And they're obviously the sales and marketing effort there as well. But the three big ones are the stock comp, the acquisition intangibles, and the Texas file deal. And then the fourth more general bucket as Brian said, we intend to add about 200 new heads in the year. Those people are all on board for many months before they're very productive in terms of generating revenues. 
Tim Quillin – Stephens Inc.: Right, and then in terms of the master service agreement in California, how do you think about that in terms of accelerating time to revenue? Are you starting to see some opportunities you might have thought would go through a lengthy RFP process start to move quickly using the MSA? Or is it not quite so – maybe not moving quite so fast? Thanks.
John S. Marr Jr. : Yeah, no, we do believe that a number of counties that we are in discussions with have been looking to that to get finalized. They do intend to leverage that agreement rather than go through an independent process.  The courts are very organized with each other. So the San Luis Obispo deal I think really was somewhat of a template for this master agreement and for other deals. They do watch each other very closely.  So we feel good about our position. We're engaged with a number of counties that I think picture themselves utilizing that agreement, probably making decisions. And we would expect to have other arrangements in place this year. But as we said in the remarks, they probably won't contribute anything meaningful to 2013 results. But I think they will build our book of business going into '14.
Tim Quillen – Stephens Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Please go ahead with your question.
Jonathan Ho – William Blair & Company: Hey, guys. You talked a little bit about the environment again incrementally improving. Can you maybe characterize where we stand relative to a normalized environment? Is it now better? Or is it sort of in line with a normalized environment at this point?
John S. Marr Jr. : Yeah, no, it's not better. It's better than it was in 2010 and '11. Probably more because things that have been postponed become more urgent than the general environment being that much better. So it is better. People are – decisions are getting old enough that and urgent enough that they have to make these decisions. And some of the processes are moving forward more normally. But it's certainly not where it was prior to that marketplace.  And I think not just the activity we track, but something we're pleased with is, we're back to our regular low double-digit organic growth with nice acquisitions and tuck-ins and the company really performing the way it was prior to that environment.  If you look at the other companies in the space, that's the exception. Most companies are not back on a growth plane. Most of them are generally flat. Or in a lot of cases, off somewhat still at this point. So I don’t think everybody's enjoying a return to growth in what we have. And that’s why as we've said, we attribute our recovery more to our improvement competitively than the modest recovery in the marketplace.
Jonathan Ho – William Blair & Company: Got it, and just as a follow-up with regards to Microsoft. I mean why do you think things have kind of picked up in the fourth quarter on the license side? Is this time in channel? Is this just the sales force having more experience of the product or credibility? I'm just trying to understand a little bit better what your thoughts are around that opportunity and how you maybe see that shaping up for 2013.
John S. Marr Jr. : Yeah, you can look at this positively or not. The significant increase in the report that we just received that will be recorded in Q1 is largely driven by one deal. They had one very large deal in Indonesia. So as I said, you can look at that as you will. And as we said, this will probably continue to be a little lumpy until they really build up the channel enough to be more reliable.  Looking at it either way as I said, that it could mean that may not reoccur and it will continue to be choppy. But on the other hand, I'm encouraged because I know what's involved in winning a significant site. So that would have been retail. Obviously, our share isn't that, but retail of multi-million dollar license deal in a part of the world where we certainly have no exposure directly. And that's exactly what we're trying to do with dynamics is to get exposure to markets that we wouldn’t be in directly as well as to improve our presence in our own traditional markets. And it's encouraging to see them develop in a major enterprise deal competing with the tier one-type vendors. Bu they did have a very significant deal, which represented more than half of what that report will be.
Jonathan Ho – William Blair & Company: Excellent, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Raghhavan Sarathy from Dougherty and Company. Please go with your question.
Raghhavan Sarathy - Dougherty & Company: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is on the Texas eFiling opportunity. The court order from the Texas initially mandates the use of eFiling in civil cases and certain courts, but not in justice of municipal courts where the case volume is heavy. I know John, you said you're expecting between $15 to $20 million in annual return revenue. I'm kind of wondering what kind of case lowered our volumes is contemplated in that. 
John S. Marr Jr. : That is strictly, as you said, the civil volume in those courts. That does not include anything from municipal courts or other courts that are not part of that mandate. 
Brian Miller: And the current run rate right now or the current volume of filings in civil courts in Texas is about $6 million annually. And under the current system, only about 500,000 of those are currently filed electronically with the existing system, which not all counties use is not mandatory and is both expensive and capacity constrained. So that run rate for us moving up to $15 to $20 million in annual revenues is as you build up to that $6 million transactions that are currently the total for the state at the current level. 
Raghhavan Sarathy - Dougherty & Company: And then can the product handle eFilings from adjustments in municipal courts? Is the potential for the revenue opportunity in case if it gets adopted or mandated?
John S. Marr Jr. : It could, but it is not contemplated under any of the arrangements we have now. The municipal courts are separate and entirely different. So it's just like this. We would have to go build interfaces and bring a system up. And it would be – it could do it, but it would be a pretty different project than the one we have in place.
Raghhavan Sarathy - Dougherty & Company:  Okay, and just one follow-up. I'll jump back in the queue. You talked about eFiling being a material option for the year. And you said you don’t want to get into the details. But if you can step back from some of the details, how should we think about the total market opportunity for the eFiling business? 
John S. Marr Jr. :  I don’t think we're prepared to give too much. We don’t have visibility to know what that necessarily looks like. But we have as we discussed a number of counties, two states in place. We have Texas and Oregon coming on. We have a lot of our existing clients looking at that. Probably the accounts we're talking about, obviously Texas is a big part of that. There's a $30, $35 million a year recurring revenue rate. And certainly, it's a small percentage of where Odyssey exists. And we certainly can put this in place where Odyssey doesn’t exist.  So we look at this as a very significant opportunity that could be multiple of the business we currently can identify. Costs do grow as we expanded. But certainly, not proportionately to the revenues. So the next $10 and $20 million increments will be much higher margin than this initial investment that we make. But they are projects that do require resources at the same time.  So it's a significant growth opportunity. We're very focused on it. It's very important to make the right investments now and to deliver very high quality service so that we continue to benefit from that in the marketplace. 
Raghhavan Sarathy - Dougherty & Company:  Thank you. 
Operator: (Operator instructions). Our next question comes from Mark Schappel from Benchmark. Please go on with your question.
Mark Schappel – Benchmark: Hi, good morning. John, with respect to the California Courts opportunity, I believe last quarter on the call, you thought that there could be three to six court decisions in the next six to eight months. I was just wondering if you think that’s the case, or if that’s shifted a little bit higher or lower?
John S. Marr, Jr. – President and CEO, Director:  Probably still a relevant number, certainly not lower. I would think the three might be out of play, and maybe the brackets move up a little bit. We’re certainly engaged with, you know, the higher end of that range, or you know, say six or eight good names that we think potentially we might make decisions this year. But, as we know, timing is always hard to predict, but it’s an active pipeline.
Mark Schappel – Benchmark: Thank you, and as a follow-up; any big counties in the mix that you can comment on?
John S. Marr, Jr. – President and CEO, Director:   You know, they’re not really the biggest counties. So, that’s a good question and so far these are not mega deals. These are, you know, $3 to $8 million kind of deals.
Mark Schappel – Benchmark: Okay, and then one question for you Brian. Last year, I believe, the Appraisal Services Group faced some margin headwinds, and I was wondering, what’s your outlook for margins in that group over this year?
Brian K. Miller – EVP, CFO, Treasurer: 
 :
Mark Schappel – Benchmark:  Thank you.
Operator:  (Operators instructions) Our next question comes from Brian Kinstlinger from Sidoti & Company. Please go on with your question.
Brian Kinstlinger – Sidoti & Company, LLC:  Great, thanks. With the discussion on software license increasing roughly 20% ish, maybe more. Subscriptions growing so quickly, I still get the sense that you think gross margins will be flattish, and I’m wondering given the much better mix, which one of those factors drive that down and fully offsets that better mix of revenue?
John S. Marr, Jr. – President, CEO, Director:  Well, as we’ve said, a lot of the expenses that are holding the margins flat aren’t necessarily related to revenues earned in the year. They’re the stock options expense, the (immunization) of new acquisition intangibles. Specifically the (tech) file investment $3 million by itself, and then, you know, a lot of smaller projects like (tech) file that – we won’t go into every name, but you know, create another bucket of expenses. So, none of those are, you know, associated specifically with revenue mix or a particular revenue into 2013. Steps indicate the (tech) files we do see those revenues. The good news would be developing rapidly as we move toward 2014.  And I see this as a flat year, but the typical guidance we’ve given you guys in terms of the margin opportunity over the long-run, you shouldn’t look at any differently. This just happens to be a flat year, and there will be another year that’s a real strong year, and over your 3 and 5 year outlooks, this is not a change or any long-term trend. It’s just a year where there’s an opportunity to make some important investments and we’ll do that.
Brian Kinstlinger – Sidoti & Company, LLC:   Okay. And then, the market seems to be regarding you more like a [inaudible] Company, and in the many years I’ve been looking at you, obviously you haven’t received the evaluations. And this is the first year in quite a long time, you haven’t really bought any or any significant amount of stock in probably the 10 years I’ve looked at you guys. So, I guess I’m wondering, do you expect that you will be more active in the market despite the revaluation and how the street has looked at your stock?  Or do you think there’s a better use of your cash flow over the next year or two?
John S. Marr, Jr. – President, CEO, Director:  Well you’re right. This is the first – we’ve been almost 15 months without buying a stock. It’s the first time that’s happened since we’ve started buying our stock a little more than 10 years ago now. We’re fortunate; we bought a lot of our stock in the two years previous to that, which now looks like a good investment. We, you know, used some debt to do that. We’re at net cash of zero roughly today, so we have earned our way out of that. We’re more disciplined in acquisitions these days than in the early years of building the company where there was more urgency to get to that leadership position. But even with that stronger discipline, I’m very pleased that we’ve been able to find the types of companies to join us, and the people, and the products that have come with them.  So, at this level of valuation, buyers probably shift to that direction. You know, we appreciate the reasons why our stock is training higher, but it does make it less compelling for us to be as aggressive there as we have done historically, and so that’s probably the way we’ll remain.
Brian Kinstlinger – Sidoti & Company, LLC: Great. Thank so much.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Dan Cummins from B. Riley. Please get on with your question.
Daniel Cummins – B. Riley & Co.:  Thank you. I wanted to ask about (follow on) sales, and how well you think the sales course is performing with respect to, you know the tier one business that you’ve done over the last two years. And the expansion of your product foot print, which seemed to position you pretty well to, you know, grow pipeline pretty aggressively, you know just based on (follow on) opportunities. Could you just give us a comment on that and how that might be, you know, in forming your plans to grow direct sales in the term? Thank you.
John S. Marr, Jr. – President, CEO, Director: Well, I think we’ve got the coverage we need. Now obviously a higher volume could require more resources. But I think we were probably – you know, probably had marginally bigger channel than we needed in 2010 and ’11. But these are very specific skills, we had a lot of long-term people in that channel and felt it was worth, you know, maintaining that level. So, I really think our channel with a few, you know, few new positions here and there, has the capacity to deliver on the higher opportunity that we have in front of us at this point. The market, as I said earlier, is better than it was in those years, but it’s not like it’s real robust. The nice thing about improving your market share is you’re not dealing with a higher level of [inaudible] and demonstrations in these things. You’re simply, you know, being more productive. And that’s a bigger part of what our growth is right now, than just addressing more deals.
Daniel Cummins – B. Riley & Co.: And then, if I could just a follow-up sort of related for Brian. In terms of just thinking about the seasonality of the first half here, are there any roll offs related to some of the big contracts. You know, leaving us any kind of little potholes on revenue in the next couple quarters we should be aware of? Thanks.
Brian K. Miller – EVP, CFO, Treasurer:  Not specifically. We’ve seen that in the past a little bit in the appraisal business, and in the larger (Quartz) contracts, the two biggest ones are less than half complete, so there’s a lot of work left to be done. Those don’t finish up this year. We always have contracts rolling off, and other ones rolling on, but there aren’t any real significant ones.  The first quarter generally is our lightest in terms of revenues, the holidays and the – some of the processes that our clients have going on in the first quarter, in January to end-of-year, tend to make it a little more difficult for us to execute as much as we are in other quarter. So, we do expect that the first quarter is the lightest in terms of revenues and earnings as well. But as we’ve grown, the other quarters have become less seasonal and are more consistent with each other, so. But no specific large contracts that roll off.

===== 2012 Q3  (2012-10-25 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Tyler Technologies Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]
 I would now like to turn the conference over to John Marr Jr. Mr. Marr, please go ahead. 
John Marr: Okay, thank you and welcome to our third quarter 2012 earnings call. With me on the call today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like for Brian to give the Safe Harbor statement, next I'll have some preliminary comments.
 Brian will review the details of our operating results. Then I'll have some final comments and then we'll take your questions. Brian? 
Brian Miller: Thanks, John. During the course of this conference call management may make statements that provide information other than historical information and may include projections concerning the company's future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projects. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks.
 Please note that our growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. John? 
John Marr: Our third quarter financial results extend our solid performance over the last 6 quarters as this was our seventh quarter with the year-over-year revenue growth.
 We're pleased with what we do with strong results for this quarter with overall revenue growth of over 21% and double digit revenue growth in all of our software related revenue lines.
 Our organic business has returned to double digit growth levels even with a higher mix of cloud arrangements in our Infinite Visions business which includes the Windsor, UniFund and CSA acquisitions all completed since last October perform low in the quarter contributing just over 8 percentage points to our overall revenue growth.
 We continue to see strong growth in our recurring revenues from subscription and maintenance which together grew 24% and represented approximately 59% of total revenues for the quarter.
 We have seen continued growth and gradual improvement in the marketplace which began to turn around about the middle of last year. The improved market together with our strong competitive position led to another quarter of strong bookings that were up 15% from last year.
 Some of our notable recent contract signings include an arrangement with Sioux Falls, South Dakota's largest city to provide a wide range of Munis ERP Solutions including financial management, human capital management, self-service and content management.
 In arrangement with the West Contra Costa Unified School District in California which is the 24th school district to choose our Munis ERP Solution in California. Agreements with the city of Hayward, California and Gillette, Wyoming and Boulder City, Nevada which signed a 7-year SaaS agreement for our Munis Solution. And California's Palmdale School District has purchased our Infinite Visions ERP Solution.
 We also announced an agreement with the City of Converse, Texas, the multiple suites Incode solutions including ERP, municipal courts and public safety. In Colorado we announced a contract with Boulder County for our Eagle Treasurer solution as well as the 7-year Multi-Suite SaaS arrangement with Fremont County including Incode's ERP Solution, Eagle tax assessment and recording solutions. We've also signed appraisal service contracts with Santa Fe, New Mexico and Ashtabula County, Ohio.
 On the product side we continue to invest in a high level and developing efforts, building new products and enhancing existing products. During the quarter we announced a general availability of our Incident Management Solution which provides the software necessary for schools and transportation officials to record and manage school and bus incidents.
 Tyler Incident Management is flexible, in a web-based solution it can be installed in accordance with school districts policies and procedures enabling school officials to follow a consistent process for incident tracking.
 We launched the Tyler Public Safety iPad Application which delivers mission-critical computer aided dispatch and convenient records management access to first responders. The Tyler Public Safety App is a true Apple Application developed specifically to take advantage of unique Apple iOS capabilities.
 We also announced the general availability of our Versatrans, Pay to Ride solutions, a payment management tool for school districts that must assess ridership fees. Demand for the Pay to Ride Solution has grown recently as more school boards have decided to charge ridership fees to student's families as a way to help offset district transportation cost. And we completed our Windows 8 Application for smartphones and tablets for use by field permit and code enforcement crews using the Field Inspector product.
 Now I would like to turn the call back over to Brian to review our results. Brian? 
Brian Miller: Thanks, John. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the third quarter ended September 30th, 2012. You've seen the press release and the 10-Q has been filed this morning. So I'm going to provide some additional data on the quarter's performance and turn the call back to John for his final comments on the current quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2012.
 Revenues were $93.8 million, a new quarterly high, up 21.6%. Organic revenue growth was 13.1% led by increases in our recurring revenues for maintenance and subscriptions, as well as growth in our software services revenue.
 Our acquisitions of Windsor, UniFund and CSA accounted for revenues of $6.6 million or 8.5 percentage points of growth. Software license revenues grew 14.1% with 2.6% of that growth organic.
 We're now seeing year-over-year license growth in 3 of the last 4 quarters following 8 consecutive quarters of declines. This is particularly encouraging in light of the strong growth we've seen in our cloud-based business.
 Subscriptions continue to be our fastest growing revenue line and grew 41.9%. Organic growth was 37.7% and the impact of acquisitions was 4.2%. We added 12 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 19 existing installed clients compared to a total 12 new arrangements and 17 conversions in the third quarter of 2011.
 Approximately 23% of our new software customers in the quarter opted for one of our cloud-based solutions while 77% purchased the deployed solution with an associated perpetual software license.
 The subscriptions line also includes a growing revenue stream from transaction-based revenues such as e-filing for courts and online payments. These revenues rose 48% to $2.6 million from $1.7 million last year. We expect to continue to see solid growth in these revenues as both new and current customers adopt our audit e-filing service solution and more of them moved towards mandatory e-filing. For example, Minnesota's 2 largest counties implemented mandatory e-filing effective September 1st.
 Software services revenues increased 25.2% with 17.4% organic and 7.8% from acquisitions. Organic growth was primarily driven by the ramp up of work associated with implementation of contracts signed in recent quarters including the Oregon and Maryland courts contract.
 Maintenance revenue growth was 20.1% of which 9.7% was organic. Together our recurring revenues for maintenance and subscriptions comprised approximately 59% of our total revenues and grew 24.0%.
 Appraisal services revenues decreased 2.9% primarily due to the completion of a major revaluation project in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. We are now underway with other new projects including several in Ohio.
 Other revenues included $269,000 of royalty on the sales of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 by other Microsoft partners in the second quarter. These royalties are reported one quarter in arrears as the royalty reports we receive in a given quarter pertain to activity from the previous quarter.
 Our blended gross margin for the quarter was a new quarterly high at 47.9% compared to 46.8%. The improvement was mainly driven by the blended software services maintenance and subscriptions margin which increased to 120 basis points reflecting our operating leverage and incremental recurring revenues. SG&A expense was 22.3% of total revenues representing a decrease of 200 basis points from the same period last year.
 Non-cash stock compensation expense was $1.9 million compared to $1.6 million. $286,000 was included in cost of revenues and $1.6 million was included in SG&A expense.
 Net research and development expense increased 1.8% to $4.3 million. R&D expense reimbursement recognized under our agreement with Microsoft in the third quarter of 2012 and 2011 was $1.0 million and $885,000 respectively. We do not expect to receive any further reimbursements under the agreement.
 Net income was $10.8 million or $0.33 per share compared to $7.5 million or $0.23 per diluted share last year. The fully diluted share count declined by approximately 26,000 shares. Our effective tax rate was 39.2%. Free cash flow was $31.8 million, up 31.1% compared to $24.3 million last year. Excluding real estate CapEx, our free cash flow was $32.9 million versus $24.3 million.
 Day sales outstanding in accounts receivable was 75 days at September 30th, 2012, an improvement of 13 days compared to 88 days on September 30, 2011. This is also down from 99 days at June 30th as billings peak in June with a high level of maintenance billings followed by collections in the third quarter.
 Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $357.9 million, up 19.8%. Backlog related to our software business which excludes backlog from appraisal services contracts was a record $328.2 million, an 18.3% increase. Backlog included approximately $109 million of maintenance compared to about $100 million a year ago. Subscription backlog was $80 million compared to $62 million last year.
 Our bookings for the quarter which are calculated from the change in backlog plus revenues were 15% to $92 million. For the 12 months ended September 30th, bookings were up approximately 19% over the prior 12 months period. We signed 16 new contracts that included software licenses greater than $100,000 and those contracts had an average license of $232,000 compared to 18 new contracts with an average license value of $277,000 in the third quarter of 2011.
 Our total headcount grew by 37 to 2,276 employees at the end of the third quarter compared to 2,239 at the end of the second quarter.
 Now I'd like to turn the call back to John for his further comments. 
John Marr: Thanks, Brian. We are encouraged by the modest but continuing improvement in the marketplace as well as the improvement in our competitive position due in part to decisions to invest heavily in product development even as new business markets were generally week.
 Last week I had the opportunity to visit our Windsor office in Phoenix, the home of our Infinite Visions products. As you know, just a year ago this week we acquired Windsor and in the following month followed up by acquiring CSA and UniFund, their 2 retailer partners.
 We're very pleased with their performance as well as their integration with each other as well into Tyler. This process has been very well managed by our local government team as well as the Infinite Visions teams. Now I'm convinced we will exceed our expectations with this division for years to come.
 Revenue from our Microsoft Dynamics AX products continue to grow although somewhat slowly. Both Tyler and other Microsoft partners are now actively selling Microsoft Dynamics AX and the pipeline is building.
 We have very little visibility into the Microsoft partner channel pipeline and most of the early opportunities that Tyler is pursuing with a dynamic solution had not yet reached the decision point.
 This quarter we recorded $269,000 of royalty revenues related to the dynamic sales by other Microsoft products that result in the second quarter. That amount has a little more than the total royalties from the first 2 quarters combined. The royalties this quarter represent about -- are represented from 23 clients in 13 different countries. Most of the sales by Microsoft partners in the first quarter have been upgrades from other Microsoft products which do not carry a license royalty that do want maintenance royalties for Tyler.
 In addition we had approximately $167,000 of revenues related to Tyler's direct sales of Dynamics. Year-to-date, our total royalty revenues are $518,000 and direct revenues are $584,000 for a total of approximately $1.1 million.
 We've consistently communicated our expectations that Dynamics will not generate meaningful revenues before 2013. We do however expect the revenues will continue to build and given that the majority of the cost associated with the product are relatively fixed and are in our current cost structure, we would expect that as royalties and license revenues build, we will see improvement in the contribution from these sales.
 Courts & Justice is currently our fastest growing division as our Odyssey product has a strong leadership position in the court space particularly in the high end of the market. Our technology, our track record of successful implementations and our high customer satisfaction contribute to this leadership position.
 We've previously discussed our relatively new opportunity in the California Courts market that is the reason out of the termination earlier this year of an unsuccessful project to build a statewide custom case management system. As a result, we expected a number of California counties will be in the market for new systems. While we don't typically comment on awards prior to executing contracts, San Luis Obispo County recently posted a notice of Intent to Award Tyler a contract to implement our Odyssey system there.
 While we expect California will be a highly competitive market, we are encouraged to be selected in the first half since the cancellation of the CCMS project with evaluations course that were significantly that were significantly higher than other competitors.
 In addition to our Courts & Justice, our new business pipeline is very active across all products, with the volume near historically high levels. However we believe the mix of new business in the fourth quarter will include a higher proportion of cloud contracts than previously expected and a few contracts will require deferred revenue recognition. For these reasons we have slightly revised our revenue and earnings guidance of the year.
 We currently expect 2012 revenues to be between $360 million and $363 million. We expect 2012 diluted earnings per share to be approximately $0.96 to $1.01 and fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be approximately $32.5 million to $33 million.
 For the year, estimated pretax expense related to stock options and the employee stock purchase plan is expected to be $7.5 million or approximately $0.17 per diluted share after taxes. The estimated effective tax rate for 2012 of approximately 39.2% and we expect our total capital expenditures will be approximately $12.5 million to $13.5 million for the year and total depreciation and amortization will be between $13.2 million and $13.7 million. Capital expenditures for the year include approximately $6.5 million related to real estate and office facility construction.
 Now we'll take your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Nathan Schneiderman from Roth Capital. 
Nathan Schneiderman: I have a few questions for you and just when you look at prospects for Microsoft royalty revenue, do you think about giving that number north of $1 million quarterly run rate. Do you think it's going to take until the second half of 2013 to get you there or is it likely to be sooner than that? And is this just in general looking like it's -- the Microsoft revenue flow is maybe looking like it's not going to move the needle here too much until we get to 2014 or am I misjudging that? 
John Marr: Well not to give you a -- not to try to -- not to give you a good answer is, but we really don't know Nathan. It is increasing steadily, the number of accounts increases, the footprint of the marketplace, 13 counties -- 13 countries that's last by quarter, activity we see, I don't see anything at Microsoft that they are discouraged by. So kind of those less tangible broad indicators are still positive and there're still a lot of enthusiasm around and the absolute numbers that we're booking certainly isn't that substantial. But it is growing, and we really don't know. 
 We'll get a report in a week or 2 that will tell us how many sites and how many countries and what the dollars are for our -- this past quarter now, as you know the report we'll get and what we reported for this quarter was for the second quarter. So there is a quarter lag there, that's only their third quarter of complete presence in the marketplace. So -- but it's really hard to know. 
 I think that we should approach that number that you mentioned certainly sometime in the next few quarters, but it's hard to say. It will be a little lumpy in our direct sales, I mean we could win a significant deal sometime in the next few quarters and that would make it somewhat lumpy on our direct sales, but there will probably be more of a drives alone continued bill. 
Nathan Schneiderman: Okay and, but just in general is this going maybe a little more slowly than you would have thought, let's say maybe a year ago or is this just about what you're expecting? 
John Marr: Well again I didn't have real specific expectations because we just wouldn't have been based on its actual. We have -- if you go back and look at our comments on this, we've always been cautious. We think this is an exciting project. We think it will be substantial, but I kind of set it if you look at Odyssey today which we're happy to report it's doing well, it's going to have well above overall Tyler growth experiences for the years coming forward. That product is approaching 10 years in the marketplace now and I'm not suggesting this won't take anything like that, but it takes -- that's a big success, but it takes a long time to get to a point where you have a market, you're going to have consistent revenue. So I think 2 or 3 years to build of book of business, it's consistent and substantial is we'll be successful for a new product like this. 
Nathan Schneiderman: Okay, it makes sense. Just you essentially mentioned Odyssey, I wanted to follow up with you on the California opportunity and maybe to make it a little more granular, if you look at cities or counties in California, how many of them would you expect to have a courts-related RFP over the next year or just so to help us kind of get our arms around the potential opportunity? 
Brian Miller: Well we'll be careful, because as we said we don't even normally think to dispose is posted on the administrative office of the courts website and I think some of you have maybe reported on. So we're going to have knowledge that deal. I don't want to get in a situation where we're being too specific or granular about that, but at least several. There are a couple of active processes now -- there is one multi-site process underway, so generally 3 to 6 decisions maybe in the next 6 or 8 months. 
Operator: And the next question comes from Charles Strauzer from CJS Securities. 
Jonathan Tanwanteng: It's Jon Tanwanteng jumping in for Charlie. Can you expand a bit on the sales cycle, there is a period we're shortening yet and why or why not? 
John Marr: Yes, it probably is. Again there were extra steps and considerations that were being added to processes during the 2009 and 2010 timeline in that environment it probably has returned to be a little more normal. Decisions seem to be occurring on the process line that is published originally with the process and again for a couple of years it seems like most of those processes were extending beyond that. 
Jonathan Tanwanteng: Okay, that appears to be sustainable. 
John Marr: Hope so, I think so. Yes, I think that probably local governments adjusted to the new environment that they are in, projects that were delayed have got holding up that they need to be dealt with and yes, I hope that we're seeing that decisions are being made a little more normal. 
Jonathan Tanwanteng: Got it, and then on the Microsoft business, any further data points to share on initial client implementations and how they have been going? 
John Marr: They have been going well and I think the good thing about the time it kicks the ramp business in this business, it does also allow products to mature. So what we did in Redmond which was our earlier adopted site which were lot of resources added, lot of resources on our dollar and it's part of the early roll out. I think the product has already kind of matured through that process and we have a few small sites we're implementing now and those are more normal and able to support themselves from mostly the contractual professional services in the arrangement. So that's all good, the product is performing well, it demonstrates very well in the marketplace, and I think as we win more business, we'll be able to execute those contracts more within the contract arrangement itself and not have to subsidize them as much as you would in earlier release products. 
Jonathan Tanwanteng: Got it, okay and then what are your plans for cash flow in 2013? 
Brian Miller: Well, we haven't given 2013 guidance. We'll give that in connection with our fourth quarter earnings release. But we do expect as we -- it looks like 2012 cash flow will end up a bit above 2011. We do expect to see solid growth in cash flow particularly with the growth in our recurring revenues which generally are paid in advance that is a positive to cash flow from the deferred revenue growth. So we'd expect to see solid growth, but beyond that we'll get more specific on that when we give our guidance. 
Operator: And the next question comes from Tim Quillin from Stephens Inc. 
Timothy Quillin: I just want to understand the fourth quarter guidance a little better, because I think the full year guidance that you have narrowed a little bit implies 4Q EPS of $0.24 to $0.29 which is obviously down quite a bit quarter-to-quarter. I just want to know what the thought process is there. 
Brian Miller: There are few things that affect that, and I'll just note that the -- that's giving narrowed the range for the year's guidance by a penny on each end, but essentially if you look at the midpoint, our guidance for the year has not changed. So the estimates that were on the street were a little bit flipped from our -- the mix -- the split between Q3 and Q4 from what we actually did. 
 But when you look at the change from Q3 to Q4, there is a couple of things, first of all, we had the million dollars of R&D reimbursement in Q3 that won't exist in Q4 or in future quarters going forward, so that's a couple cents difference on that item. We do expect to see lower services revenues and margins with lower utilization around the holidays in particular on some of our large projects like some large court deals where we're just not able to get the same utilization with the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. 
 We expect to see a bit higher SG&A, we had a couple of items in Q3 that won't be in Q4, we had lower incentive compensations we're going to have a cumulative catch up there. We had as well as a very favorable health cost experience over the last couple of quarters that was reflected in our Q3 results, we don't know what that'll be in Q4, but our guidance assumes normalized health costs there. 
 And then the last item really is related to revenue recognition, as we get into the end of the year it looks like that both Q3 and Q4 have a little bit more cloud-based business in the mix that we don't get to recognize revenues upfront on obviously, as well as the potential for a couple of contracts that are traditional deployed contracts that may have terms that cause us to either have deferred revenue recognition or percentage of completion accounting. 
 And some of those were still in the works so we're not certain about it but that little bit higher level of deferred revenue recognition and more cloud-based business in the mix contributes to that as well. So those all add up to kind of that were the reasons for that split between Q3 and Q4 being a little different. 
Timothy Quillin: Now that's helpful, and regarding that mix you had to previously expected software licensing to grow pretty nicely, I think double digits in 2012, do you think software license revenue will still grow for the year? 
John Marr: I think our expectation for the year, we had talked about low-double digits and then just north to 10% range, I think now we're probably looking at mid-single digit license growth. 
Operator: And the next question comes from Brian Kinstlinger from Sidoti & Company. 
Brian Kinstlinger: The first question I had is related to the California opportunity, I'm wondering if you had discussions at all with the larger counties, and maybe what's your reaction was to your landslide victory in that small county? In addition, are you offering this in SAS form, or do you expect that all will be in software license form and whatever you win in that opportunity? 
John Marr: I think there are mega counties, as you know there were counties in California that are even bigger than a number of our state-wide deployments. And there are some of those that will be running a process but as you might expect their planning process and timeline will be longer than some of these smaller ones. 
 So I don't think you'll see mega counties in this next 2, 3 quarter cycle, probably more of the year and 2-year out timeline. So I think that's what we're seeing there. We will not dictate whether it's a non-premise traditional deployment or a SAS arrangement, we'll put out either of those. 
 At this point it seems to me that most of their -- most of the counties that are active are looking for traditional arrangements, we do have the benefit of significant recurring revenue either way, our maintenance fees and it's really kind of a modified subscription arrangement anyways, we don't resell next release that built into the fee and I think the recurring revenue will be significant either way, and obviously we're hopeful to get our eFile Solution a standard part of these arrangements either initially or as a follow on which is a very significant recurring stream for us as well. So we're certainly conscious of creating relationships that are sustainable and allow us to deliver the value to that marketplace that they really need and obviously support our business needs over the long term. 
Brian Kinstlinger: And just to that part of that question, have they communicated there was larger counties in anyway shape or form, how you won that in the landslide and has that been a discussion with those -- obviously those larger counties? So your functionality was so much better that showed than your pricing? 
John Marr: Yes, I mean other counties that have acknowledged that to us and congratulated us on that and I think we have our supporters out there. We'll be cautious. There are other capable companies obviously net marketplace that want to get a piece of it but obviously we've wanted an objective scoring process significantly and it is published on the administrative office of the court's website and so it does represent something that the market is looking for more than on our process. So we're encouraged that up, but we certainly will take the competitive landscape seriously out there at the same time. 
Brian Kinstlinger: Right, okay and one question on dynamics or 2 here together, maybe I want to try to size a pipeline in any way we can't age of growing, is there a number you can quantify of rough proposals you're looking at or dollar value you're looking at over the next year to bid on? 
John Marr: Well it's growing and even though it's on a small number I guess from a percentage standpoint the royalties are growing significantly and hopefully we reach a more significant base and then those percentage is continue. They're very actively engaged with the partners as 13 countries represented, and we certainly expect that to continue to trend up and hopefully significantly but as we've said it's very hard to gauge and it wouldn't be responsible for us to guess that and give you those numbers. 
 In terms of our direct sales we have several dozen types of opportunities that we're pursuing, we've been fortunate to win a number of them but unfortunately they've tended to be smaller deals, $100,000, $200,000 license type fees, it's been good for us to win that business, it's good for us to now have 3 or 4 concurrent implementations going on to grow our own professional services group, to grow our programmatic expansions groups and those sorts of things and kind of built the business around this. There are some larger deals in the pipeline but it's hard to predict, it will be successful, and one will be successful with those, but we certainly hope to and expect to win what are more significant deals as we go forward. 
Brian Kinstlinger: Okay, last question I have is on eFiling. I just want to go back to the model, it's not much of a charge to your customers if I understand, they pay per transaction. So first, am I right, and then the second, so I'm interested in that operating margin contribution if it's pretty much 100%, and then I'm interesting and I asked this at the Analyst Day, trying to seize the opportunity for you, what percentage of your clients have this and is generally the larger customers of yours that don't have this that are going to implement as you think, like Minnesota I think that you talked about, just trying to gauge eFiling please. 
John Marr: Yes, it is both. We have sold in the past licenses and maintenance arrangements; we certainly prefer the collect approach and because the clients really get to pass a lot of those cost on to the law firms and the uses of the system in this case it is much more popular with the clients than in our other lines of business. 
 So our other lines of business as you know kind of grown from the 15% adoption rates and maybe 30% through the recent environment, but this is at least an 80-20 situation -- by far there are more clip-based arrangements, and it seems to work better for both of us than purchasing a license which is the model we prefer less. We obviously have a number of clients, large clients and states that didn't have this, we still just acquired this 2.5 years ago. 
 So yes, we haven't -- a lot of Odyssey clients that don't have an eFile solution in place and I think there is very strong interest, they had a customer forum just a few weeks ago that I attended and a number of those state-wide clients and large counties are actively considering what they're going to do in this area. 
 So I think our ability to leverage this into our installed base as well as include it with the future arrangements is really strong. The growth opportunity here is significant, this has been successful and it's a high level of interest and people combining this with their case management system, makes a lot of sense. 
 We're on a very good position on this, there will be investments we need to continue to make, capital investments as we host and have facilities to manage this and in some of these large arrangements, there are helpdesk we have to create for the law firms to come in, there are problematic extensions that sometimes have to made in different states. So in some cases I think we'll be talking about some investments ahead of the ramp and fees that there is certainly a significant opportunity here with other state-wide implementations and add-ons to some of our large counties. 
Brian Kinstlinger: All right, I just want to put one. 
John Marr: Brian, this would be high incremental margin types of revenues because of the direct costs are generally credit card fees and then we've got a bucket of costs associate with the infrastructure, that helpdesk the servers, the equipment that sort of stuff. 
Brian Kinstlinger: Sorry, last one I promise. So you said $2.6 million revenue this quarter, is the opportunity to drive the lead $40 million revenue that was at the opportunity is much higher in the long, long term obviously or is the opportunity there to double or triple it from there which might not get you there? I mean I'm just trying to figure out penetration rates, are you hardly penetrate into your client base yet? 
John Marr: Well I don't we're hardly, there are number of significant, Clark County is a big user, mentioned Las Vegas, New Mexico and a number of clients are using it but yes, there is certainly an opportunity that's a multiple of what our current business is, putting brackets around that right now probably hard to do but this is a significant growth opportunity. 
Operator: And the next question comes from Scott Berg from Northland Capital Markets. 
Scott Berg: A couple of quick questions here, first of all in terms of the buying environments I picked up some data amongst the number of states where it seems like tax receipts as a whole are up which would indicate maybe a slightly improving and buying environment for your customers. Are you seeing anything in terms of any of their habits or what you're seeing, hearing in terms of maybe RFPs that would maybe support that or not support that? 
John Marr: Yes, I think, as we've commented I don't think the market is all the way back to where it was pre-2009 but it has recovered, decision processes are happening a little more normally and a little more of a normal timeline. Now I'd probably attribute a third of the improvement in our business over the last year, year and a half to recovery in the marketplace, but the other 2/3, and the more significant improvement, I think is more based on our improvement and our competitive position. As the market weakened, companies either chose or couldn't continue to make the level of investments they've might have wanted to in a different environment, and we were able to bid, and it's clearly differentiated us really across the board with that product. So I think we're benefiting more from that than the market recovery. 
Scott Berg: And then in terms of your guidance, I forgot if it was you or Brian that made the comments, that you're seeing more customers to choose your SAS-based product here in the third quarter and then in the fourth quarter. Do you think this is a permanent shift that you're seeing, because it's obviously not exactly in line with your expectations 90 days ago, or it's just maybe more transitory and we return that to -- I guess levels you've seen more recently. 
John Marr: I think it's a trend that obviously could jump around a little bit, but I think that the idea of hosted solutions and arrangements obviously is getting traction in the marketplace. And the local government marketplace is slower to embrace those changes than the commercial marketplace, so we've been in this now for 10 years, 11 years and it's only in the last year, year and a half that those adoption rates have started to move from 12%, 15% to 25%, 30%. 
 I would think over time that, that is the trend that we'll continue, certainly if the broader markets continue to embrace that. We've also had a lot of success converting existing clients to hosted arrangements and those have been successful that we're traveled throughout our customer base and into the high level of interest in that, so we've continue to expect to see that happen as well. 
 So with -- along with our eFile Solution, now we grew our subscription base business in the 30% plus range some previous years and you think is that base grows that, that would lower on a percentage basis and this year it's going to be more on 40%, pretty high. But really with the flips with the existing clients moving to hosted and with the adoption rate growing and along with the higher growth in our eFile business, we do expect that to continue to grow at a significant level, not probably 40% on a year-over-year basis, but significantly above our company growth rates. 
Brian Miller: And Scott, this quarter we had -- I'm sorry, in this quarter in terms of the adoption the percentage of new customers is fairly similar to last quarter but the mix this quarter there were a few more of the larger deals were as in prior quarters the cloud customers have tended to be more on the small side, and that bounces around from quarter-to-quarter but that's part of it the adoption rate as an increase to the mix of the size of those customers has changed a bit. 
Scott Berg: Great, and then last question for Brian, your DSOs in the third quarter were much lower on a seasonal basis when I think I was expecting, is that something that's sustainable going forward or will this be more of a I guess a short-term anomaly? 
Brian Miller: Well seasonally they do drop down normally in Q3 because they spike in Q2 with the maintenance billing, so you get a lot of billings, but the revenues are recognized over the next 4 quarters. So they do -- and we do collect a lot of those fairly rapidly so that leads to the strong cash flow in Q3. So it is seasonally normal that it drops but they are 13 days below where they were last year Q3, and we've seen a trend of improvement there. Some of that is a result of efforts on the collection side and trying to do better job of tightening that up. And I think the generally improving environment helps that a bit as well, and a little bit less deferred payment terms that were part of some of the contracts during the more difficult new business environment. So we certainly would like to continue to see that number come down year-over-year but seasonally this is a normal trend. 
Operator: And the next question comes from Raghhavan Sarathy from Dougherty & Company. 
Raghavan Sarathy: Just a couple of questions from my end, first question is for John. John, you've talked about pipeline remaining active, we have highest volume, can you give us some sense for the year-on-year growth on pipeline through 9 months? And also as a follow-up, it looks like it's coming in the market place your competitive position is improved, I was wondering whether we should see some acceleration in your organic revenue growth given factors? 
John Marr: Well, we're not going to quantify the pipeline, it's just kind of a competitive issue but I think across the board we're seeing some improvement and the size of the pipeline as well as the behavior of those processes going along a little more normally. Obviously, the significant growth and pipeline would be more related to the court situation with the layer of California opportunities really adding significant link to their -- to market footprint, previously it was really that California didn't exist and obviously it's a big part of the market when that moves in. So that contributes significantly to that. I'm sorry what's the other half of your question? 
Raghavan Sarathy: Yes, the 2 things you mentioned where there is a recovery in the marketplace your competitive position has improved. If you look at the organic growth rate so for is about 10%. I was wondering whether these 2 factors could help to accelerate the organic revenue growth. 
John Marr: Well of course it has accelerated right, for 2 years we were relatively flat I think the year that was flat in the year that was 5% or 6% and now we're back in that 10%, 12% organic growth rate. We've got a bigger basement we used to have, so 10% or 12% our company behaves pretty well. It generally starts to provide the margin opportunity again at that level as well. I think for the most of our company, that's probably the right range for people to anticipate at a general level. We'll be more specific with guidance probably in January. But that's generally kind of the growth rate that we're expecting and targeting for the broader company. I do expect that Courts & Justice will grow above that trend line with the California opportunity being on top of what was already a pretty good pipeline for them. 
Raghavan Sarathy: So maybe if may if I get some clarification. If you win some of the California opportunities, there is then opportunities to accelerate from the 10% to 12% base level we are looking at? 
John Marr: Yes, little bit, but let's remember, I mean there were $60 million, $70 million unit for us and another -- going from 10% to 20% growth with them obviously is only another $6 million or $7 million a year in business which obviously don't we have a couple of points on our overall business. So I think within the division, they will grow more significantly. I think that'll provide an opportunity for them to have margin expansion over the long run. As I indicated earlier, they will have investments to make to prepare for some of the eFile arrangements where revenues ramp up after the investment you've made. But over the long run, that will be a significant opportunity for them. But again as only 20% of our overall business, even with the significantly higher growth rate, it is only a few percentage points on the whole company. 
Raghavan Sarathy: Okay and then just one final question. You signed to be on Charlotte I think earlier this year that I was thinking that you probably have the license revenue bump in the third quarter or maybe fourth quarter it seems like being more to half. So Brian, can you help us understand where do you are with that implementation? 
Brian Miller: With Charlotte, the percentage of completion contract and it is, it will take place over multiple quarters, I'm not sure the implementation term but I think it's probably a 6 to 8 quarter revenue recognition event. So the license it was an $8 million range kind of a contract with a few million dollars of license and that's -- again spread over multiple quarters, so there is some activity there has started ramping up this quarter, but the impact is, it doesn't provide a real bump in any given quarter. 
Raghavan Sarathy: Okay, so I'm sorry, final question. I'm not sure if you can comment on it, but I was just curious when I looked at the San Luis Obispo County scoring, who had the highest bid, yet you ended up outscoring your competitors even on price which was a bit surprising to me. I was kind of wondering, what were the sort of the dynamics that lead you to even score the highest on price quote as well? 
John Marr: I think the sophisticated buyer and they normalize those, so if somebody bid very, very light services and it was clear that it'd be more services required then we're included in the bid. They made those adjustments to make sure that they were comparing apples-to-apples. So I think our proposal was comprehensive. We have a good record of delivering within scope and I think they did their homework on that. So you're right, we ultimately scored better than what you first look might suggest. 
Operator: And the next question comes from Jon Ho from William Blair. 
Jonathan Ho: I just wanted to talk a little bit about the maintenance pricing. Have you guys seen a shift at all in terms of pricing or are we seeing this bounce back to normalized levels as it seems like the environment is improving. 
John Marr: There is always some pressure on it. There are some vendors in the new business market that I think of having trouble winning business on, but costs and they are in some cases being aggressive and sometimes and something we have to respond to. We're pretty disciplined about it. We're pretty convinced obviously within our customers' interest, but with our evergreen strategy and long-lived investments for them, there is a lot of value in our maintenance arrangements. So we do try to stand on it. But yes, there'd be some stronger pressure, but again these are long-term arrangements and clients are not going to pay for things they don't believe have the value associated with them, but they don't necessarily select the lowest bidder either. They do select the system they think delivers the best value to them, which sometimes can be a more expensive solution. 
Jonathan Ho: Got it. And just in terms of your competitive wins. Are you seeing this more at the higher end of the market that you've traditionally played or is this at the low-end or is it just across the board that you're just seeing the competitive wins pick up? 
John Marr: It's across the board, I mean we talked Charlotte a minute ago, obviously the court's deal is a big deal. So we're doing somewhat better in larger arrangements. I think that's where we're very cost effective generally less than the tier-1 players. But our local government division probably had the biggest increase on a percentage basis and bookings this year which generally sells $100,000 to $300,000 arrangement. So it's across the board. 
Jonathan Ho: And just building on that, I mean do you feel like Tyler is now maybe distancing itself a little bit more from other competitors or potentially moving into its own category, just as a nationally recognized player. Just want to get a sense of whether at a strategic level that's taking place. 
John Marr: Well you got to be careful about that obviously. We certainly aren't going to rest on any laurels, but we're pleased, and I think we have clearly established the leadership position across the board with these applications and really across the country and geographically. So we're pleased with that, but there are still very viable competitors out there that are still kind of anxiously interested in the marketplace. And we're going to certainly expect that they continue to invest and compete, but what we've done the last couple of years in terms of market share, geography, size and major clients, we are pleased with. 
Operator: And the next question comes from Mark Schappel from Benchmark. 
Mark Schappel: Most of my questions have been answered, I do have one though. And John, I was wondering if you could just address whether there was a meaningful movement in RFP activity during the quarter that you saw. 
John Marr: Now it's more gradual than that. I don't think we could say, but again over the last 3, 4 quarters the pipeline has strengthened, and things are behaving more normally. But there is no spike in the quarter that's for sure. 
Mark Schappel: Okay, great. And then with respect to the pipeline, I wonder if you just provide some additional on commentary what are you're seeing with respect to the large deals in the pipeline, whether you're seeing or you continue to see movement toward the larger deals. 
John Marr: I think outside of courts no, I don't think the mix in terms of size of clients is changing that much there. There aren't that many Charlottes out there, there are many more of the $0.5 million, $1.5 million deals that we often don't even mention. So now I think the volume in the pipeline is still in the midrange for our non-courts business. Obviously, the courts deals are larger deals for us. 
Operator: The next question is a follow-up from Tim Quillin from Stephens Inc. 
Timothy Quillin: I understand that the stars and the moons aligned pretty well for you in the quarter in terms of margins, but even if you exclude the Microsoft reimbursement out, you're at 18.8% margin. I mean how far ahead of ourselves should we get in terms of thinking about margin potential for 2013 and 2014? Is that kind of that kind of close to 19% range? Is that an achievable level in kind of in the near to near-intermediate term? 
Brian Miller: Well, I think that, as John said earlier, as if we're growing in this low double-digit in the 10, 12-ish percent range that we would generally expect to see gross margin improvement something north of 100 basis points and with the opportunity again depending on the mix, depending on some of the recurring revenue growth. But the opportunity for a little bit higher than that. But we would expect to see 100, 150 basis point gross margin improvement, and potentially a little bit better than that on the operating margin line as we were able to leverage SG&A and we also believe that we'll be able to leverage R&D. Obviously, over the last couple of years, we've significantly increased our investment in R&D. And I think going forward over the next year or 2, we have an R&D infrastructure in place at around this level that'll continue to serve us well. 
Timothy Quillin: Okay, great. And then regarding the bookings outlook right now, in the fourth quarter of last year, you had a court booking with Maryland that you drove the number -- the bookings number up quite a bit. I understand it's hard to predict lumps, but are there opportunities out there on the court side where you could get to similar level in the fourth quarter of this year? 
John Marr: Timing is hard to predict, but there are I think 3 statewide processes that we're engaged in, probably only one of them in the size of the Maryland and Oregon deals. So the timing is hard to predict, but there are some of those and then again probably beyond those processes, you do have these counties in California that, by themselves, are comparable to many states. So there are big deals out there, but the timing of them will be very hard to predict. 
Brian Miller: I wouldn't expect that there'd be a Maryland size deal in Q4 based on what we see now. 
Operator: And the next question comes from Brian Kinstlinger from Sidoti & Company. 
Brian Kinstlinger: Just one follow-up. In regard to the Maryland and Oregon deals that you did shine, is there any timing of software license payments based on how you're accounting for that? Again software license is flat, those were some huge deals and so I'm just wondering is there a certain core you expect to bump or a fall-off in software license? 
John Marr: Well they are recognized, both of those are percentage of complete accounting and so they're recognized over the implementation periods. There are 5- and 6-year typed implementations, so those licenses are spread over a number of quarters. Oregon is much farther along and they're not straight line over that period, so they're somewhat bell-curve type spreads. Oregon is much farther along, and I think Maryland is only a few percentage points complete. So we haven't recognized much license at all on Maryland, yet that'll be starting to ramp up in the coming quarters. Courts & Justice I think had about 20% to 25% increase in their license this quarter over last quarter. So some of that Oregon is reflected there, but again those are spread over a number of quarters, they're not lumpy at all and so it doesn't move the needle as meaningfully in any given quarter, but it's in that base and it's replacing other business that -- in smaller contracts that finishes up. 
Brian Kinstlinger: So just to be, just understand, so in Maryland when it ramps up, will there be -- suppose the first point is 20%. When they hit that, well you get 20% of license in one quarter or every quarter you gradually get a little piece of this software license. 
John Marr: No, it's the latter. It's recognized basically on percentage of completion basis measured by basically the service hour deliverables. So as we provide hours. 
Operator: And as there are no more questions to present at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Marr for any closing comments. 
John Marr: Okay, thank you. And thank you for joining us on the call today. If you have any further questions, feel free to contact Brian and myself. Have a good day.

===== 2012 Q2  (2012-07-26 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello and welcome to today’s Tyler Technologies Second Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Your host for today’s call is John Marr, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, July 26, 2012.
 I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Marr. Please go ahead. 
John Marr: Thank you. Welcome to our second quarter 2012 earnings call. With me on the call today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First I’d like for Brian to give the Safe Harbor statement, then I’ll have some preliminary comments, and Brian will review the details of our operating results. Then I’ll have some final comments and we’ll take your questions. Brian? 
Brian Miller: Thanks, John. During the course of this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information that may include projections concerning the company’s future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Please note that all growth comparison we make on this call today will relate to the course binding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. John? 
John Marr: Thank you. Our second quarter financial results builds on a solid performance over the last 5 quarters as this was the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. We continue to see exceptionally strong growth in our recurring revenues from subscriptions and maintenance, which together grew over 24% and represent approximately 58% of our total revenues for the quarter.
 Our return to growth levels more in line with our historical experience is partly attributable to a modestly improved market. We have improvement across the board in our competitive position from continued investments and our products relative  downturn is the primary cause.
 We had another very good quarter for bookings. We signed a contract valued at more than 8 million with the city of Charlotte North Carolina. Charlotte is the 17th largest city in the country by population. It will be the largest city to implement the Tyler ERP system to date. This was dealing with the [ph] highly competitive process including major Tier 1 ERP vendors. We believe it speaks to Tyler’s strong market position.
 We also signed the contract with the city of Gillette, Wyoming which represents our first news client in that state. Other significant contracts in Munis ERP solutions announced during the quarter include St Lawrence County New York, city of Alexandria, Virginia,  Alexandria City of Public Schools, the city of Des Moines, the capital of Iowa, and the city of Miramar, Florida.
 We have also announced agreements for our Incode Municipal Court case management solution with Oregon's second largest city – Eugene, and Plano, Texas, Texas's ninth largest city, and the nation fourth fastest growing city since 2010.
 Jackson, Mississippi, the state's capital and largest city also signed the contract for our Municipal Court software during the quarter. We signed contracts with  Scarsdale, New York and Santa Fe, New Mexico to provide real property appraisal for municipal wide revaluations.
 Finally, I am pleased to report that we have signed 2 -- we signed our first 2 direct sales of Microsoft Dynamics AX. And Truckee Meadows Water Authority which provides water for Reno and Washoe county Nevada, has purchased dynamic [indiscernible] financials , along with Tyler's eden [ph] payroll and human resource applications and other extensions. In addition the global alliance for TB drug development a non-profit organization dedicated to discovering and developing improved TB treatments have selected Tyler to provide dynamic financials in the cloud environment. The TB alliance is based in New York and has international operations. While these are not large contracts, the signs represent an important  milestone in our Microsoft dynamics business.
 Another important milestone we achieved during the second quarter was our first Odyssey court case management provide [ph] in Oregon. Yamhill [ph] county successfully piloted our solution and went live in early June, less than one year after we signed a contract for the statewide implementation of Odyssey in Oregon's 36 counties. This successful effort is the result of the proven repeatable and highly reliable implementation processes that Tyler has honed during 6 statewide Odyssey deployments in the installation of more than 400 counties nationwide.
 As we discussed on our last call, we completed the acquisition of Computer Software Associates at the beginning of the second quarter. CSA founded in 1982 and based in Billings, Montana is a reseller of Tyler's infinite visions, school enterprise solution in the northwest.
 In addition, CSA has a robust line of proprietary software for county government, including solutions for land and  vital records and indexing for county recorders and taxation solution for county treasurers. CSA had approximately $8 million in total revenue in 2011 and has more than 200 installations in 10 states. The CSA transaction complements 2 other recent Tyler acquisitions, Windsor Management Group and UniFund. We are extremely pleased with the performance of these acquisitions and have been impressed with the quality of the infinite visions product and the strength of the employees that joined Tyler from these organizations.
 Now I would Brian to provide more details on the results for the quarter. 
Brian Miller: Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2012. You’ve seen the press release and the 10-Q has been filed so I am going to provide some additional data on a quarter’s performance then turn the call back to John for his final comments on the current quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2012.
 Revenues were $91.4 million a new quarterly high up 19.1%. Organic revenue growth was 11.9%  led by increases in our recurring revenues from maintenance and subscriptions as well as growth in our software services revenue. Our acquisitions of Windsor, UniFund and CSA accounted for revenues of $5.5 million or 7.2 percentage points of growth.
 Subscriptions continue to be our fastest growing revenue line and grew 45%. Organic growth was 41.1% and the impact of acquisitions was 3.9%. We added 24 new subscription based arrangements and converted 17 existing installed client during the quarter compared to a total of 13 new arrangements and 10 conversions in the second quarter of 2011.
 Approximately 33% of our new software customers opted for one of our cloud based solutions up 67% purchase to deployed solution with an associated perpetual software license. The subscriptions line also includes the growing revenue stream from transaction based revenues such as e-filing for courts and online payments. These revenues total $2.3 million up from $1.5 million for the same period last year.
 Software services revenues increased 20.8% with 13.3% organic and 7.5% from acquisitions. Organic growth was primarily driven by the ramp-up of work associated with the implementation of contracts signed in recent quarters including the Oregon and Maryland courts contracts.
 Maintenance revenue growth was 20%, of which 10.4% was organic. Our maintenance revenue growth rate continues to be reduced somewhat by the effect of existing installed clients converting to our hosted offerings, which results in a loss of maintenance revenue offset by a larger increase in subscription revenue.
 Together, recurring revenues from subscriptions and maintenance comprised approximately 58% of our total revenues and grew 24.3%. Appraisal services revenue decreased 3.6% primarily due to the completion of a major revaluation project in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. We are in the startup stages of several smaller new projects, including several in Ohio.
 Other revenues included a $129,000 of royalties on sales of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 by other Microsoft partners in the first quarter. A blended growth margin for the quarter was flat at 44.5%. Gross margin for our software licenses increased 320 basis points mainly due to revenue mix with less third party software. The blended software services, maintenance and subscriptions margin increased 80 basis points, reflecting the leverage in the incremental recurring revenues.
 We also experienced pressure on services maintenance and subscriptions margins from increases in our implementation and development staff that accommodate current backlog and anticipated growth. Excluding staff added to the CFA acquisition we added 43 people in the second quarter with additional staffing increases planned for the second half of the year.
 These margin increases were offset by an expected decline in our appraisal services margin from 38.2% last year to 32.8% this year reflecting the lower level of appraisal services revenue combined with the shift towards projects that are generally at normal margins compared to the higher margins we have achieved on certain larger projects from the last 2 years.
 SG&A expense was 23.7% of total revenues representing a decrease of 40 basis points from the same period last year. For  the second half of the year we expect SG&A expense will be approximately 24% of revenues. Non-cash stock compensation expense was $1.8 million compared to 1.5 million. $257,000 was included in the cost of revenues and 1.5 million was included in SG&A expense.
 Net research and development expense increased 7.4% to $5.4 million we did not have any R&D expense reimbursement recognized under our agreement with Microsoft in the second quarters of either 2012 or 2011. We currently expect to record the final R&D reimbursement offset of approximately $1 million in the third quarter of 2012.
 Net income was $7.1 million or $0.22 per diluted share compared to $5.6 million or $0.17 per diluted share. The fully diluted share account declined by approximately 1.1 million shares as a result of our stock repurchases in 2011 effective tax rate was 39.2%.
 Free cash flow was negative 12.9 million compared to 1.2 million in last year’s second quarter excluding real estate CapEx our free cash flow was negative 11 million versus 1.2 million. The decline in free cash flow is primarily attributable to the timing of the collection and to a lesser extent to the increase in the number of new subscription contracts which generally have lower upfront payments than comparable traditional license arrangements.
 Today in July our cash collections has been more than $10 million ahead of collections for the same period last year, but at this point the timing appears to be catching up. Day sales outstanding and accounts receivable is 99 days at June 30th 2012, an improvement of 7 days compared to 106 days at June 30th 2011. Our maintenance billing cycle typically peaks to its highest level in June and second highest level in December of each year, followed by higher cash collections in the subsequent quarter and as a result, DSOs are seasonally higher at the end of the second and fourth quarters.
 Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $360 million, up 21.6%. Backlog related to our software business, which excludes backlog from appraisal services contracts was $328 million in the current quarter, a 20.5% increase. Appraisal services backlog was $32 million compared to $24 million for this time last year. Backlog included approximately $114 million of maintenance compared to about $104 million a year ago, and subscription backlog was $73 million compared to $50 million a year ago.
 Our bookings for the quarter which are calculated from the change in backlog plus revenues, we’re up 7%. Excluding acquired backlog, bookings were up 3%. For the 12 month ended June 30th, bookings were up approximately 19% over the prior 12 month period. Excluding acquired backlog, bookings rose 16% in the last 12 months. We signed 19 new contracts that included the software licenses greater than $100,000 and those contracts had an average license of $306,000.
 Compared to 10 new contracts with an average license value of $640,000 in the second quarter of 2011, it should be noted that signings in the second quarter of last year included the $31 million Oregon courts contract. During the quarter we completed the acquisition of computer software associates for cash purchase price of $9.4 million net of cash acquired of $437,000. Our total head count grew by 127 to 2239 employees at the end of the second quarter compared to 2112 at the end of the first quarter. The quarter end headcounts includes 84 people added with the CSA acquisition.
 With that I’d like to turn the call back over to John for his comments. 
John Marr: Thanks, Brian. The results for the quarter reflect the continued gradual improvement in the marketplace in the stability and steady growth in our current revenue. After 2 years of limited growth and strong expense management we are making the necessary investments largely additions to professional services areas that do temporarily delay margin expansion.
 My experience we’ve characterized the market is having somewhat recovered from the weakness that we seen prior to 2009 level. We are pleased with the improved market share we have achieved this is a reflection of improve collaboration between our sales and marketing people working with developers to identify and address on a timely basis the changing needs of our customers and prospects.
 Our backlog grew year-over-year for the 9 straight quarters. As a rollout of Dynamic Microsoft Dynamics progresses both Tyler and other Microsoft partners are now actively selling Microsoft Dynamics AX and are starting to build the pipeline. We have very low visibility into the pipeline from the Microsoft partner channel. In most of the early opportunity the Tyler is pursuing with dynamic solutions have not yet reached the point on selection.
 Most of the sales by Microsoft partners in the first 2 quarters have been upgrades from other Microsoft products which do not carry a license royalty but do earn maintenance royalties. Given the length of a typical sale cycle it is not surprising that we have not seen a large sales in the first half of the year. In Q2 we received royalties of about a $129,000 related to the sales of Dynamics by other Microsoft partners in Q1. These include sales in 5 countries and a mixture of new and upgrade customers.
 As we have consistently said in the past we do not expect Dynamics will generate meaningful revenues before 2013 and we will not likely be profitable before 2014.
 Our 2012 annual guidance is generally unchanged from the last quarter. 2012 guidance is we currently expect revenues in the range of 360 to 366 million. We expect 2012 diluted earnings per share to be approximately $0.95 to a $1.02. With fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be 32.5 to 33 million. For the year, estimated pre-tax expense related to stock options and employee stock purchase plan is expected to be $7.4 million or approximately $0.18 per diluted share after taxes.
 We estimate an effective tax rate for 2012 of approximately 39.2%. We expect our total capital expenditures will be approximately $16.5 million to $17.5 million for the year, and total depreciation and amortization will be between $13.2 and $13.7 million. Capital expenditures for the year improved approximately 9 million related to the real estate and office facility under construction.
 Now we will take your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Timothy Quillin at Stephens, Inc. 
Timothy Quillin: I don’t think anybody really expected to royalty revenue to be meaningful at this point, you’ve said early on the year that’s you would hope that it would be equal to the drop off in R&D reimbursement or offset that. And I just want kind of verify what that mean exactly. So does it mean that the -- I think reimbursement last year was 3.5 million and this year it will be something like 1 million. So does that mean that 2.5 million differences is the revenue that you hope to have or is it, is it little more complex in that. 
John Marr: Now -- generally what we patterned that plan but again as we’ve said we really don’t have much visibility on what comes through the channel. I know its active but as we know in this business it takes a long time actually occur what we’ve recognize in one quarter actually reflects what they did in the previous quarter and what we booked in Q2 with Q1 result. But that is what we put in the plan and what we’ve previously communicated. We will probably going to need more activity in the second half than we would have expected so the first half so the little larger than what we had expected but again it is bit hard to call because there really isn't a lot of -- visibility there. And Tim we are talking about that we were talking about revenue both from the royalty stream and from our direct sales, and so this quarter 129,000 reflected the royalty and -- about another we're less than 400,000 of revenues from our direct sales of dynamics. 
Timothy Quillin: Right, okay. And then cash flows Brain, generally about your cash from operations is 1.5 to 2x net income on an annual basis, is that still the goal this year or is there something changing about the cash flow dynamic. 
John Marr: No, I think that’s still the same for the year, I think for the last 5 years we’ve managed about one and a half times and I think our expectation is still the same, I think this quarter there was a little bit timing just seems to be a little bit less we see in Q2, Q3 as we said is off to a strong start that basically offsets the shortfall in Q2, and I think there is a little bit of effect from the ongoing shift towards a little bit more subscriptions that is more pronounced this quarter, but for the full year I think our expectation is for that relationship to be similar. 
Timothy Quillin: Okay. And just lastly, you’ve won a couple of large ERP deals this year in Charlotte and Pasco county schools, and I’m just wondering if you feel I guess what your win rates are on larger deals on ARP and if you feel like your winning rate is starting to increase on larger size opportunities? Thanks. 
John Marr: Well, the sampling on deals of those sizes are probably small enough but it’s hard to get meaningful market intelligence out of it. We do know on broader samples that our competitive position in those products has improve pretty significantly over the last 2 years. So we are pleased with that. Our people work very closely we know that smaller marketplace out there is very competitive and that we need to respond to everything we see in the marketplace and our customer base to improve our competitive position and our people have done a very good job doing that to seeing those results. But again percentages on deals the size of Charlotte, Pasco,  could be misleading, because there just isn't enough. Just as you observed winning those 2 deals is significant and Charlotte would be largest city that purchase this, it’s an arms [ph] wouldn’t deal, no existing relationships. Amazon [ph] deal against the primary tier 1 players and we I think one of the pretty solid player there. So we feel good about that and we would certainly hope that that will position us even better and those have the opportunities going forward. There are other active opportunities in that size range where I think we are playing pretty well most situations. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the Charles Strauzer at CJS Securities. 
Charles Strauzer: My 2 questions one can you give us a quick update as you could on California and kind of what’s going with the court systems there? And then also in the sense of the backlog both timing and mix you can give sort of more color on that? Thanks. 
John Marr: Yes, sure, Charles. As we’ve said before and many of you aware that the California courts marketplace has change pretty significantly this year there was a state wide build going on intention was the build a system for California that the counties would adopt, adopt and that project has been shelved so many of those counties have pretty old systems and certainly in need of new systems and had again been anticipating this new system that no longer will be built. So it is active. I don’t know exactly how many I want to say, but certainly there are handful that are moving relatively quickly to try to buy a new system in a few months for the past to target the street relatively soon and again there are several other counties they are in that process and would expect to receive our future then in the coming month or 2 really. So it’s an active market place obviously we know it’s a very big state and we add that to the country it changes the landscape significantly. I think we are pleased that we are seen as a leader in the state. We didn’t have a presence there because going national or the courts offering has been really coincidental with that build. So there haven’t been any decision [indiscernible] but I think they recognize what we’ve done in these other states wide implementations has been successful. Obviously going live with the segment in Oregon that quickly demonstrates our ability to execute is going to be important part of the decision process. So it’s active. There are opportunities. We’re excited about it. But we will see how it goes from here but it’s certainly good opportunity. 
Charles Strauzer: Great and just if you could give some more color on backlog in terms of timing? 
John Marr: Yes, we’re pleased with backlog growth this quarter which is all time high and there is an organ or amount in there. So it’s really made up of a lot of winds across the divisions for not outside deals. So backlog is going nicely and I use to say we didn’t pay a lot of attention to it and didn’t encourage people to over analysis. I think as we have the shift that we are seeing from traditional licenses to staff arrangements as thing you call data licenses [indiscernible] accounting purposes. It probably use the pretty good indicator of market activities. So our sales in booking certainly appear somewhat stronger than what would be indicated by looking at the financial statements. So I think backlog is encouraging at this point. 
Brian Miller: But on the timing of the backlog it is marginally lengthening I think a year ago 70% of our backlog was expected to be recognize in the next 12 months at the end of last year is more like 65% as subscription backlog which is multiyear and some of the larger contract to the multiyear continue to be a bigger piece of the growth there. It lengthens modestly. So a little bit longer term visibility there. 
Charles Strauzer: So roughly what percentage of bank loan would you say assess [ph] right now? 
Brian Miller: The Safe backlog was the subscription backlog at the end of the quarter was $73 million out of 360 million that grew 45% over the last year second quarter. 
Operator: The next question comes from Nathan Schneiderman with ROTH Capital. 
Nathan Schneiderman: John, I wanted to start with the question for you. You spoke to modest improvement in the environment. And I was just curious if you could detail what particular data you’re seeing that makes you say that? 
John Marr: Yes, we tracked a number of ERPs and the value of them in everything you’d expect as to track, we do have to normalize it, because overtime we want in certain markets or geographies where we were now, so an increase doesn’t necessarily mean the market is strong, so we tried to normalize it for our change in terms of foot print over that period of time, and based on what we track, we feel that the market probably contracted around 30% from where it was in 2007 or ‘08 and ‘09 in the peak, and then it probably has recovered somewhere by the around of middle of that in the last year or so. I don’t think that means local governments are necessarily spending more freely, but as we indicated that things grew older and older in the pipeline, those decision processes are happening. So, the ERPs are coming back a little bit and decisions are happening a little bit more normal, but certainly not recovered all the way back. And so I think the increase are back, further growth levels is probably more attributable to the improvement in the competitive position. 
Nathan Schneiderman: When you look at the RFPs, what percent would you say they’re up year-over-year and if the sale cycle has improved by what magnitude? 
John Marr: I think they’re probably up 10 or 15% year-over-year and I think that sales process has improved because I think people we don’t deal that were in the pipeline and our piece coming out now, reflect opportunities where they are really is essential need that has to be addressed. So there is little more pressure on them to execute on the process more normally. 
Nathan Schneiderman: Question on the Microsoft relationship in outlook I gather from your comments you are not expecting the Microsoft business to generate operating profit in 2013. My sense is maybe that’s it change in view and can you just clarify that and if there has been a change in view what’s driving that and what in general are you thinking about revenue expectations for that product line maybe third party and direct in 2013 just broad-brush? 
John Marr: Pretty hard to say. I don’t know because the changing view I think our view is probably pretty broad and if all somewhere in it and we’ve built tougher for the long time the rolled out products and it takes a long time and I think that’s why you see us to do 1 or 2 this kind of investments that are catalyst for growth in earnings down the road only 1 or 2 to time because we know the process its very long. I think it’s kind of interesting right now that probably that most exciting opportunity the most significant price of growth in Tyler is around or obviously product and as many of your know. We’ve been in good demand, well for 10 years. So it’s significant contributor or certainly very pleased with the investment we made there but it takes a long time as that indicate even when successful to build a successful business around it. So I think as we’ve been saying for some time we had a product that released in the second half of last year that exciting but it still takes some time to build the profitable and successful company around it. And I think that will take 2 to 3 years as we are indicating here to become profitable and obviously once we should become profitable incremental revenue beyond that will be very high margin as in this case it’s royalty base then the costs relatively effects. So I don’t think it’s changed off a lot. There is a lot of visibility around it, but it’s indicative what the time it takes to establish good presence in the market and build the business around it. 
Operator: The next question comes from Jonathan Ho at William Blair. 
Jonathan Ho: Yes, just sort of quick question around sort of the SaaS adoption terms, it looks like a pretty big pickup again this quarter, has your view changed at all relative to sort of that overall trend and perhaps maybe what the end mix will look like in terms of SaaS versus license? 
Brian Miller: I think that’s a fair observation and I think our forecast projected will continue and so we are in a 30% range that is up bit meaningfully from where we have been last few years and again the forecast is somewhat consistent with that for the next couple of quarters. So it could be a [indiscernible] trend we will have to see. It is also a little bit reflective of -- our SaaS offering is much broader now. Initially it was just Munis and it continue to spread to some other applications. But it’s virtually all of our enterprise applications now, so that obviously makes difference as well. 
John Marr: And when you look at it in terms of adoption we look at both the number of new customers which is what we said this quarter about a third of the number of new deals were SaaS based. But the dollar value they tend to be on the smaller side. So the dollar value that new deals in assess model was more in the 20% range which is fairly consistent with prior quarters maybe little bit higher. 
Jonathan Ho: Got it. That’s helpful and not to beat the Microsoft topic too much but I just wanted to understand from your perspective -- what are some of the signs that the product is getting traction. Or what are some the milestone that you look for? Is it third parties that are validating or what has to take place for the adoption to really pick up here? 
John Marr: Well. Obviously we got their channel in hours, their channels as we said we don’t have a large visibility in individual deals. What we can see is that partners start to build businesses around it start to move away from products they might have marketed before we look for resellers of theirs, they have customer basis this select to this really to be the follow on product of deal. Rollout individual store base and so far. And they have a lot of activity along those lines but again so -- seeing actual revenue which is we are all interest for will take some time but they certainly have partners around the world that our new customers, new companies to this state people whether due to have proprietary product for previously resold the Microsoft or another product that are moving toward dynamics as their products for the customer base in the marketplace and obviously as they rolled that out in the traction in the customer base those can be significant opportunities. So we see that kind of activity with certainly continues to make us comfortable. So this will be significant down the road but we continue to be cautious about the timing of that. In our own channel, obviously we can see the forecast and we’re certainly active in a number of different deals, few of them relatively significant and obviously we’re looking for that decision processes to progress. But these have the earliest are fees that were written last fall, last winter, our typical sales process is a year or so can be longer, and so while we’ve won a couple of deals that as you can see a little different than a typical city or county, not for profit or loss that might have a little different process the typical deals that we pursue are still in process and haven’t yet reached a decision, but we’re certainly attracting a number of those that we would expect to make decisions in the second-half of the year. 
Jonathan Ho: Got it. And just one final follow-up around sort of the maintenance revenue, are you guys kind of looking at maintenance price increases similar to what you’ve shown in the past or is the stone environment where there maybe -- you have seek maintenance increases, a little bit lighter than normal? 
John Marr: It might be a little bit lighter, but literally instead of 4 5 into 3 4, it’s not a situation where we have to not have an increase or have a pretty significantly lower, but they could be modestly lower. It’s not across the board, if you look at individual clients and in some cases cities have grown and they use other system as different and is significantly greater value on what they’re getting from us and the increases totally just applied and the value proposition can be reinforced to the customer. In other cases that may not a have done the case and if we’re getting an increase where many, many years from international purchase and may not be as one. So, on some cases, side-by-side situation but again there is a strong value proposition we have and evergreen strategy with the systems are improve significantly these investments were talking about for the new business market obviously rolled out for the installed customer base within the maintenance agreement. So we have a very strong argument in terms of the value proposition customers event very long with returns on investment. So I think increases will be supportable going forward but we certainly wanted to add the value to the client and in the case where it were get ahead of itself and we certainly provide that relief to the client. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Schappel at Benchmark. 
Mark Schappel: John, I was wondering if you just give us an idea of your plans for additional head count additions for the balance of the year? 
John Marr: We are -- as we provided additional heads lot of it right now is in professional services and as we indicated that put the low pressure on margins depending on the division of the complexity of the products it could be 90 days or it could be 6 to 8 months depending on those positions in terms of the on-boarding and getting them to a point where they are productive in terms of revenue. But we will continue to add heads mostly in the professional services area at this point in time. We don’t have exactly what the number would be but I will guess that that it’s probably similar to first half 40 or 50 organic heads for the second half of the year. 
Mark Schappel: And then with respect to the large deal With City of Charlotte is it fairly assume that that’s subscription deal? 
John Marr: No, that’s not a subscription deal. 
Mark Schappel: It’s not. Okay. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Raghhavan Sarathy at Dougherty & Company. 
Raghavan Sarathy: Two questions from me. First in terms of license revenue growth it was down slightly after increasing last couple of quarters on a year-on-year basis, I was wondering whether you are -- whether you recognize any revenue from the Charlotte deal you talked about and then how we should think about license revenue growth potentially rebounding the back half of the year? 
Brian Miller: Charlotte is a percentage of completion accounting deal. So there was virtually no revenue recognition in Q2. So that will ramp-up and be a multi quarter implementation so another worth new thing recognized meaningfully in Q2 and the expectation is again there is a depending on how the mix falls out between subscription and perpetual, but we still believe that we will finish the year with license growth probably above 10% for the year. 
John Marr: There are a lot of variables in determining what the new business level is and you would think that licenses recognized would be high among those and reality is, it’s really not. It bounces all over the place and the timing of it and the volume of it is it necessarily that reflect your current business. The mix of business SaaS versus traditional, the accounting of the deals TOC versus recognizing on delivery, number of different variables basically make it such that the license number in the quarter isn’t that reflective. I can tell you because of that what we do is as we look at every deal and whether it’s traditional or whether its SaaS and -- PLC always different things. We try to normalize work that we represent in terms of new license revenue we talk well -- straight deal of that type and based on that which is where we track or -- what we’re doing in the marketplace. The first half of this year was very strong it was up significantly from the first half of last year. And how it fall through and one fall through to the financial statement is a different issue. But we are pleased with the modest recovery in the marketplace and again our performance within that market in the first half. 
Raghavan Sarathy: I guess let say control the work, but it is fair to say that hospitality assumptions is based on about -- 10% license certainly [indiscernible]? 
John Marr: Yes. 
Raghavan Sarathy: Okay. And then in terms of I think John probably make the comment about software services margin being pressured by increased head count. At the second quarter margin reflect the -- or had expenses on the increased hiring and how should we think about that margin in the back half? 
John Marr: Both kind of rolling -- everybody is not hired and same day and all don’t become productive on the same day. So I would say it doesn’t necessarily reflect the full volume because we continue to higher people that won’t be productive for some period of time. But obviously people we hired 3 months ago and 4 months ago will begin to become productive. So I think the impact will probably remain somewhat the same through the second half of the year. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. At this time there appear to be no more questions, Mr. Marr, I’ll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks. 
John Marr: Sure. Okay. Well, thank you for joining us on the call today. And if there are any further questions, feel free to contact Brian and myself. Have a good day.

===== 2012 Q1  (2012-04-26 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello. And welcome to today’s Tyler Technologies’ First Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Your host for today’s call is John Marr, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, April 26, 2012.
 I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Marr. Please go ahead. 
John Marr: Thank you, Amy. And welcome to our first quarter 2012 earnings call. With me on the call today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First I’d like for Brian to give the Safe Harbor statement, then I’ll have some preliminary comments, and Brian will review the details of our operating results. Then I’ll have some final comments and we’ll take your questions. Brian? 
Brian Miller: Thanks, John. During the course of this conference call management may make statements that provide information other than historical information that may include projections concerning the company’s future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits.
 Such statements are considered forward-looking-statements under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. John? 
John Marr: Our first quarter financial performance builds on a solid performance of 2011, as the marketplace began to show signs of modest improvement. Total revenues for the quarter were $82.7 million, or an increase of 13%, of which 8% was organic and 5% was due to the acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of 2012.
 We continue to see strong growth in our recurring revenues from subscriptions and maintenance, which together grew over 17%. In addition, although we continue to see a gradual shift toward our SaaS model, our software license revenue grew by over 9% over the first quarter of 2011, representing the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year license revenue growth.
 Gross margin for the first quarter rose 80 basis points to 45.2% for the first quarter, compared to 2012 of 44.4%. However, our gross margin improvement was mostly offset by increases in SG&A costs related to facilities, increases in headcount for sales and certain internal support functions to support growth, as well as increased stock compensation expense.
 Increases in research and development expense also offset our gross margin improvement. This increase is primarily because there was no expense reimbursement offset from Microsoft during the first quarter.
 We had another strong quarter for bookings. Significant contracts for the first quarter included a multi-suite school agreement with the Socorro Independent School District in El Paso, Texas, to provide our Munis ERP, Tyler Student Information System, Tyler Pulse and Tyler Content Management Solutions. Socorro is one of the fastest growing school districts in Texas with more than 42,000 students and 7,000 staff.
 We signed a contract for our Munis ERP Solution with the City of Des Moines, Iowa’s largest city and the capital of the state. With our Odyssey Courts and Justice Solutions we signed a contract with Peoria County, Illinois, for an integrated justice system including case management and jail management.
 Peoria is our first Odyssey client in Illinois. We also announced an agreement for our Tyler SIS, Special Education and Tyler Pulse Solution with the Kansas City, Missouri, School District.
 Among our SaaS agreements announced in the quarter were a 10-year contract with the Town & School District of Ledyard, Connecticut, to provide our Munis ERP solution and a 7-year contract with the Missouri City, Texas, to provide our Munis ERP and Incode municipal court solutions. We also announced agreements for appraisal services with Fairfield County, Ohio, and the Town of Farmington, Connecticut.
 During the first quarter, we announced the acquisition of Akanda Innovation Incorporated of Toronto Canada. Akanda has been a partner of our Appraisal and Tax group since 1997. They develop complementary modules to Tyler’s iasWorld appraisal and tax software.
 The Akanda team will continue to provide expertise from a variety of technical disciplines including GIS browser-based and workflow technologies, because virtually all of Akanda’s revenues already passed through Tyler as a third-party software provider, the acquisition will not have a material effect on revenues.
 Also during the first quarter, we acquired UniFund L.L.C., which provides ERP solutions to schools and local governments. UniFund, located in Nashua, New Hampshire, is a reseller of Tyler’s Infinite Visions school enterprise solution.
 UniFund’s more than 250 clients located throughout the Northeast are now Tyler customers and its approximately 30 employees joined Tyler as well. UniFund had total revenues of approximately $5.5 million in 2011.
 Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we announced the acquisition of Computer Software Associates CSA, effective April 2nd. CSA founded in 1982, is based in Billings, Montana. It is a reseller of Tyler’s Infinite Visions school enterprise solution in the Northwest.
 In addition, CSA built and maintains a robust line of proprietary software for county governments. This software includes solutions for land and vital records indexing for county recorders and tax solutions for county treasurers.
 Both products are highly competitive and complement Tyler’s existing application suites, while further increasing Tyler’s market share nationwide and in the county recorder and tax business.
 CSA had approximately $8.2 million in total revenues during 2011 and has more than 200 installations in 10 states. The CSA transaction complements 2 other recent Tyler acquisitions, Windsor Management Group and UniFund. Of the $13.7 million combined revenues in 2011 for UniFund and CSA, approximately $2.4 million is already passed through to Windsor.
 Now, I’d like Brian to provide some more detail on the operating results. 
Brian Miller: Thanks, John. Yesterday afternoon Tyler Technologies reported its results for the first quarter ended March 31st. You’ve seen the press release and our 10-Q has also been filed, so I’m going to comment on some of the key factors in the quarter and then move on to John’s comments on the current quarter, and update our outlook for the remainder of 2012.
 Revenues for the first quarter were $82.7 million, a new quarterly high, and up 12.7%, compared to $73.4 million for the first quarter of 2011. Organic revenue growth was 8.3% this quarter, led by increases in our recurring revenues for maintenance and subscriptions, as well as growth in our software license revenue for the second consecutive quarter.
 Our acquisitions of Windsor Management Group in the fourth quarter of 2011 and UniFund in early March accounted for revenues of $3.3 million in the first quarter, or 4.4 percentage points of gross.
 Software license revenues grew 9.1% from last year’s first quarter, of which organic growth accounted for 4.1% of the increase. Subscriptions continued to be our fastest-growing revenue line and grew to 43.1%. Organic growth was 38.2% in the quarter and the impact of acquisitions was 4.9%.
 In the first quarter we added 11 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 17 existing installed clients, compared to a total of 13 new subscription arrangements and 1 conversion in the first quarter of 2011.
 During the first quarter, approximately 19% of our new software customers chose the SaaS arrangement, while 81% bought our software with a deployed solution and perpetual license.
 The subscriptions line also includes the growing revenue stream from transaction-based revenues, such as e-filing in the courts and online payments. In the first quarter of 2012 these revenues totaled $2.2 million, up from $1.4 million in the first quarter of last year.
 Software services revenues increased 10.5%, of which 6.8% was organic and 3.7% resulted from acquisitions. Organic growth was primarily driven by higher software license revenue arrangements and services associated with recent large court system contracts.
 Maintenance revenue growth was 12.2%, of which 6.7% was from organic growth due to a combination of new revenues associated with license sales in the past year and annual rate increases for existing clients.
 Our maintenance revenue growth rate continues to be reduced somewhat by the offset -- by the effect of existing installed clients converting to our hosted offerings, which results in a loss of maintenance revenue offset by a larger increase in subscription revenue. The acquisitions of Windsor and UniFund contributed 5.5% of the maintenance growth in the first quarter.
 Together recurring revenues from subscriptions and maintenance comprised approximately 60% of our total revenues for the first quarter and grew 17.3% year-over-year.
 Appraisal services revenue decreased 8.3% in the first quarter, primarily due to the completion of a major revaluation project in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. We were in the startup stages of several smaller new projects, including several in Ohio.
 Other revenue for the first quarter includes a $121,000 of royalties on sales of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 by other Microsoft partners. These royalties were paid in the quarter for sales in the fourth quarter of 2011.
 For the first quarter of 2011, our blended gross margin was 45.2%, compared to 44.4% in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin for our software licenses increased 290 basis points, with the higher level of licensed revenues and a mix with less third-party software.
 The blended software services, maintenance and subscriptions margin increased to 110 basis points, reflecting the leverage in the incremental recurring revenues. Also the hardware and other margin increased 210 basis points from the year-ago quarter.
 These were offset by a decrease in our appraisal services margin from 38.3% last year to 33.2% this year, reflecting the lower level of appraisal services revenue combined with the shift towards projects that are generally at normal margins compared to the higher margins we achieved on certain larger projects in the last 2 years.
 SG&A expense was 25.8% of total revenue, compared to 23.6% in last year’s first quarter. The increase in SG&A expense is attributable to a variety of factors, some of which are non-recurring. First quarter 2012 SG&A reflects increased headcounts in sales and some internal support functions, as well as costs associated with new office facilities.
 Onetime costs included increased payroll taxes associated with higher incentive compensation payments in the quarter and expenses associated with acquisitions.
 We also recorded higher stock compensation expense, which reflects the increase in our stock price and higher commissions related to the increase in sales over last year. In addition, the newly acquired companies added approximately $620,000 of SG&A expense for the quarter.
 Non-cash stock compensation expense was $1.8 million in the first quarter of 2012, compared to $1.4 million in the first quarter of 2011. $248,000 was included in cost of revenues and $1.6 million was included in SG&A expense for the current quarter.
 Net research and development expense increased 12%, to $5.1 million for the first quarter of 2012, compared to $4.5 million for the same period last year. We did not have any R&D expense reimbursement recognized under our agreement with Microsoft in the first quarter of 2012, while R&D expense was offset by $415,000 in the first quarter of 2011.
 We currently expect additional R&D reimbursement offsets of approximately $1 million in 2012. Although the timing of the reimbursement is subject to change, we currently expect it to all be recorded in the third quarter of 2012.
 Operating income for the first quarter was $10 million and was flat with the first quarter of 2011. Net income for the quarter was $5.7 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, compared to net income of $5.7 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2011.
 The fully diluted share count declined in the first quarter by approximately 1.2 million shares compared to last year’s first quarter, primarily as a result of our stock repurchases in 2011. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 39.2%.
 We did not repurchase any shares during the first quarter. As of March 31, 2012, we had approximately 30 million common stock shares outstanding and authorizations to repurchase up to a total of 1.7 million additional shares.
 Free cash flow for the first quarter was $17.0 million, compared to $9.7 million for the same period in 2011. Excluding real estate CapEx, our free cash flow was $17.1 million versus $16.3 million for the year ago quarter.
 Receivables continued to perform well. Day sales outstanding and accounts receivable were 64 days at March 31, 2012, an improvement of 17 days, compared to 81 days at March 31, 2011.
 We collected a significant receivable which had been outstanding for an extended period of time in connection with wind down of a large contract. Our backlog at March 31, 2012, was $332.1 million, up 26.7%, compared to $262.1 million at March 31, 2011.
 Backlog related to our software business which excludes backlog from our appraisal services contracts, was $307.8 million in the current quarter, a 32% increase compared to $233.2 million a year ago.
 Appraisal services backlog was $24.3 million at March 31, 2012, compared to $29.0 million at March 31, 2011. Backlog at March 31, 2012, included approximately $98.5 million of maintenance, compared to about $81.6 million a year ago.
 Our first quarter bookings, which are calculated from the change in backlog plus revenues, were up almost 39% over the first quarter of 2011. Excluding acquired backlog bookings were up approximately 35%.
 For the 12 months ended March 31st, bookings were up approximately 16% over the prior 12-month period. Excluding the effect of acquisitions bookings rose approximately 14% in the last 12 months.
 During the first quarter of 2012, we signed 12 new contracts that included software licenses greater than $100,000 and those contracts had an average license of $503,000. In the first quarter of 2011, we signed 15 contracts with software licenses greater than $100,000 and those contracts had an average license of $232,000.
 With more of our backlog comprised of multi-year subscription agreements, as well as certain software contracts that will be multi-year implementations, the timing of the back -- the recognition of backlog has lengthened.
 On the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter of 2012 with $11.9 million in cash and investments, and $56 million in outstanding borrowings under our $150 million revolving credit facility. At March 31, we had $88.1 million of availability under the agreement. The average interest rate on our borrowings in the quarter was 3.3%.
 During the first quarter, we completed the acquisitions of Akanda and UniFund for a total of $5.8 million in cash. The purchase price of Akanda excluding liabilities assumed was $2.1 million of which $900,000 was paid in prior periods, and the net cash purchase price of UniFund was $4.6 million.
 We did not expect these acquisitions to have material impact on earnings for 2012. Also subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we completed the acquisition of CSA, for a cash purchase price of $9.8 million.
 Our total headcount grew by 21 to 2,112 employees at the end of the quarter, compared to 2,091 at the end of the fourth quarter. The quarter end headcount includes 44 people added with the 2 acquisitions.
 Now, I’d like to turn the call back over to John for his further comments. 
John Marr: Thank you, Brian. Our results for the quarter reflect the continued gradual improvement in the marketplace and the stability and steady growth of our recurring revenues, which were approximately 60% of total revenues as well as our ability to continue to improve our gross margins and to make what we believe are well-timed investments in our existing and future products.
 We continue to see modest improvement in the marketplace. Certainly, it is not all the way back to pre-current environment levels, but governments are addressing essential needs that have been deferred over the past few years.
 You can see in our numbers that bookings and backlogs have grown ahead of actual revenues recognized. We see these along with RP activity as leading indicators that we are returning to a modestly higher level of growth.
 During the past few years with lower than normal growth for Tyler, we’ve exercised the aggressive expense management. In the first quarter, you could see that we had made some important investments in sales, professional services, facilities and general support. It’s important we do this to realize the opportunity in the marketplace as well as to ensure we can deliver on the higher levels of business in a high-quality fashion.
 This said, we continue to be convinced that there remains a strong opportunity for margin expansion as revenues grow, although it may be lumpy at times.
 With the new business market slowly improving, the story is positive with respect to our recurring revenues. We continue to add clients in our SaaS and hosted offerings, including those that are new to Tyler and existing clients who convert to a hosted solution from an in-house Tyler system.
 As our industry transitions from the license on-premise model to a hosted SaaS model, it is critical that Tyler has a credible offering to make that conversion. I’m pleased that we are successfully making that conversion. Tyler now has 325 SaaS customers.
 Our subscription-based business has grown more than 30% each of the past 2 years and we expect it to grow as much as 40% this year on what is becoming a more meaningful base.
 We are also continuing to build revenues from our transaction-based revenue models, including our e-Filing solution with Odyssey File & Serve solutions for courts. We are providing the solution to clients in many cases under a modeling which we share and the filing fees collected by the courts.
 This model enables courts to implement e-filing and realize the efficiencies of eliminating paper from the system with little upfront cost, while funding the solution out of fees generated from the filings. We have approximately $1.2 million in quarterly e-filing revenues and have a very active sales effort for e-filing with both new and existing courts.
 Both Tyler and Microsoft partners are now actively selling Microsoft Dynamics AX and are starting to build a direct pipeline. We have very little visibility into the pipeline from Microsoft Partner channel and most of the early opportunities that Tyler is pursuing with Dynamics Solutions have not yet reached the point of selection.
 In Q1, we receive royalties of about $121,000 related to the sales of Dynamics by other Microsoft partners. These sales were made in the fourth quarter of last year. There are around 12 sales for the public sector in 6 different countries. These customers will also contribute approximately $180,000 in annual royalties on support agreements. These revenues are for the first full quarter the product was available, not really enough time for normal sales process.
 Given our limited short-term visibility, our current expectation for 2012 is still that we will have sufficient revenues to offset the reduction in R&D reimbursement compared to 2011, and that the net expense related to Dynamics for us will be similar to 2011. We do not expect that Dynamics will generate meaningful revenues before 2013.
 Our 2012 annual guidance is generally consistent with our initial guidance for the year provided in February. We’ve revised upward our revenue guidance to reflect the UniFund and CSA acquisitions and have slightly increased both the lower and upper end of our earnings guidance.
 Our current guidance is as follows. We currently expect 2012 revenues to be in the range of $360 million to $366 million. We forecast 2012 diluted earnings per share to be approximately $0.95 to $1.02. And we expect that approximately 60% of our earnings will come in the second half of this year.
 Fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be approximately $32.5 million to $33 million. For the year, estimated pre-tax expense related to stock options and employee stock purchase plan is expected to be $7.4 million, or approximately $0.18 per diluted share after taxes.
 We estimate an effective tax rate for 2012 of approximately 39.2%. We expect our total capital expenditures will be approximately $15 million to $16 million for the year, and total depreciation and amortization will be between $13.2 million and $13.7 million.
 Our Board of Directors has approved our plans to build a new office facility for our -Courts & Justice Division and corporate staff on the land we purchased in Plano last year. We expect that the cost of the construction will be $16.7 million, of which approximately $9 million will be spent in 2012.
 Now, we’ll take your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nate Schneiderman at Roth Capital. 
Nathan Schneiderman: John, just to clarify the modest improvement in the market that you’re seeing, have you seen any sort of step function up from the levels you were seeing in Q4 and if so what specifically would you point to there that you’re seeing? 
John Marr: No, not really. I would characterize the market as having remained in a much lower activity range through the middle of last year. And as we started to see and report the second half of last year, our bookings and experience were improving. And I would just say that, that continued, that did continue through the first quarter and we’re still experiencing that in the second quarter.
 So I would not want to characterize it as some significant step up, but there certainly is some improvement. And I think it’s mostly attributable to these deferred projects that really do need to be addressed at this point. 
Nathan Schneiderman: And then, just a follow-up question then, kind of a clarification on the Microsoft situation. So, $120 million of royalties and you’re expecting -- sorry -- $120,000 of royalties, $180,000 up supports as $300,000 or so, $300,000 on 12 deals, it just -- I was under the impression that these Microsoft Partner deals were larger than deals which you were typically seeing. So, can you explain what’s going on there?
 And then, Brian, just related to the Microsoft, can you explain how the rev-rec is going to work in general when a Microsoft Partner sells it, will you tend to recognize all that revenue, one quarter later period of time then when the partner books the deal? 
John Marr: Yes. It’s a good observation. Obviously, the maintenance we report is not, that revenue was not included in the quarter. But we’ll be very conscious as we have been with our own business that, wow there’s a new business market and license and associated with that.
 We’ll be anxious to build our recurring revenue underneath that and look forward to where that supports our investment in the product and the licenses can be incremental and much higher margins. So, the fundamentals in building that business are very similar to our own proprietary business.
 Obviously, we’re just getting our royalty of that. So the sales to the customer were much higher. The reseller, or channel partner, kept their share there and then we share in the royalty that Microsoft gets after that. But we do have an arrangement with Microsoft, where both Tyler customers as well as their proprietary customers of all of their Dynamics products have a low cost transition, if they choose to, from their existing Microsoft or Tyler solution to AX.
 And I think that’s important and it will help us build that support base, et cetera. So a number of these were transitional clients, or licenses were artificially low. But again they have, they’ll help us build more in the way of the recurring support maintenance. 
Brian Miller: And Nate, on the revenue recognition. At this point, we’ll generally recognize all of our royalty upfront. We earn it without a further obligation. And in the quarter following the quarter in which the sale is made, we get that reporting typically 30 days after the end of the quarter so after we’ve already reported our earnings. And at this point, we don’t have a basis to estimate that. So we’ll record that in the quarter following the quarter that the sale is actually made in. 
John Marr: So what was reported in this quarter was for the fourth quarter of 2011, the product was released in August. So it’s very early, the normal sale cycle wouldn’t allow a normal process to be executed and a decision to be made. So obviously these were people that were waiting for the product and purchased it almost on its release.
 I think in another couple of quarters what we’ll see is more of the normal sales process resulting in those sales. So we’re -- I’d be looking for what happens a year after it was released, so what happens in the third quarter will be reported in our earnings in the fourth quarter this year -- that’s when we’ll start to see numbers that have been through the normal sales process. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Kinstlinger at Sidoti. 
Brian Kinstlinger: Maybe can you give us, John, an update. When you talked at the user conference/investor piece about a handful of states that are looking at core RFPs and we obviously talked about California as well and the counties there. So maybe give us a sense of the different stages -- in the procurement process of where they are. And then, will you need to hire given the robust pipeline and could that temporarily lead to lower EPS? 
John Marr: Are you talking specifically about courts? 
Brian Kinstlinger: Specifically about courts. 
John Marr: Okay. What Brian is referring to is, I think the market in general is behaving normally and what we’ve expected, it’s healthy. We know the states and the counties that are in the process or about to and I don’t think there is any surprises there. But significant change in the court marketplace recently was that the State of California that had a build going on with really IT services partners, very significant project, $1.9 billion project actually, that they effectively pulled the plug on that project.
 So the 83 counties in California, they really had been on hold for some time and a lot of – there probably had been very few purchases or transitions in the last 10 years in California and many of those counties are using systems that are 15 or 20 years old. They now all have to come up with their own independent strategies and no longer can just sit on the sidelines and wait for the State system to come out.
 So, obviously, California is a very, very significant sized state. And as I said there is 83 different counties of all different sizes. And so all of sudden, there is certainly is a new market opportunity that wasn’t there previously.
 We would hire, if the kind of people that could be helpful to us were available, but it’s a highly specialized skill to really know the courts, have the relationships and they are not just strict salespeople, these are people that need to be a resource to the courts in making their plan.
 So, probably there maybe a couple of new bodies that we’re able to find, people that can be effective. But for the most part, we’re going to have to lean on the people we have because building those skills is -- would only be a distraction really at this point. We’ll use the people we have for the most part. 
Brian Kinstlinger: And just a follow-up on that question, just the various stages maybe of the 5 states that are on procurement and then, are you going to hire more developers -- not necessary the salespeople, but how soon ahead of these RFPs you have to start hiring on the development side given your win rate has been 80% on the state level? 
John Marr: I don’t – I don't want to comment on those individual processes. As you indicated there are number of states that are in the process. We don’t expect to -- our back-to-back quarters with deals like Oregon and Maryland as we did last year, but there certainly remain a number of significant opportunities out there and we do expect that division to have -- continue to have higher growth than Tyler experiences Tyler-wide.
 There will be marginal growth in both sales and development, but I think we’ve been staffed there for a higher level of business and that there will be leverage between the relationship between development, growth and cost and sales growth and cost and our ability to grow the division as a whole. So we would expect that those would have some leverage and support margin expansion over time.
 Where we will see the biggest headcount growth will be in the professional services side, of implementing these systems and that is -- that has less leverage in that model. So you’re seeing some of that in the first quarter in courts, but really Tyler-wide, where we have to go out and bring in some resources, and there's some period of time while we’re training those people and getting them up to speed before we can deploy them and generate revenue.
 So, we saw some of that with courts and again Tyler-wide in the first quarter. And we’ll see some of that throughout the year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Tim Quillin at Stephens, Inc. 
Timothy Quillin: So it’s my sense that Wiznet has been a great acquisition for you in terms of generating incrementally filing business. You clearly had a strategy with the last 3 acquisitions around Infinite Visions. And I’m just wondering is that more of access to the markets or is that a product that you think could be much bigger across your existing client base? 
John Marr: Well, it’s a blend of that. Clearly, they bring some access to geography and marketplace that we weren’t as strong in as we are in other places. But the product also has a very competitive position and even in the few months that we’ve had the products, it’s been successful in the marketplace and I’m very, very pleased with that.
 I think the transactions would have stood on more of a consolidation play, as a positive acquisition for us, but again our hope was and what our current experience is, is that product is competitive. It’s competitive in some sub niches that we’re not and that we don’t have a stronger presence in what our other products, so it’s a bit of a blend.
 We will certainly continue to sell that product, invest in it and support it going forward. I don’t see it as a product necessarily, though, that gets leveraged over our other sales channel, so somewhere in between. 
Timothy Quillin: Got it. And no buybacks during the quarter, which I think is the first quarter in a long time where that’s been the case. You’re making some acquisitions or have made some acquisitions, but what do you see over the rest of the year as uses for cash? And if I can sneak one additional easy one in for Brian is where -- where do the royalties get booked is that in the software licenses line? 
Brian Miller: I’ll add to that part quickly, on the royalties and other revenues. 
John Marr: Obviously, we’ve had what we felt was a great opportunity in our stock over the last 2 years and I think bought just under 20% of the outstanding stock in 2010 and 2011. So, we don’t really have a sense of urgency to have to buy more of it at this point.
 Obviously, we’re pleased that the stock has appreciated very nicely through acquisitions, the previous stock buybacks, investments in our own facilities, we’ve deployed a lot of capital and actually have $50 million it’s off the line of credit at this point.
 So I think we’re in a position where we don’t need to be overly aggressive and can be somewhat patient, but certainly if there were an opportunity in the stock, as in the past, we’d be aggressive again. 
Operator: Next question comes from Charlie Strauzer at CJS Securities. 
Charles Strauzer: A couple of quick questions. For Brian, of the 620 of SG&A from the acquisitions you talked about, is that a good number to use kind of from how is going forward? 
Brian Miller: Yes. That’s the incremental over last year’s first quarter. It will be a little bit higher than that because the UniFund acquisition really was only in for a month and CSA, the latest one was not in this quarter at all. It was in April. So I think on a quarterly basis between the 4, or between the 3 acquisitions it’s probably going to be closer to about $1 million a quarter. So it will be a little bit higher than where we are right now. 
Charles Strauzer: Got it. Great. That’s helpful. And then John, when you look at the kind of success of this of SaaS, and you are kind of guided to over 40% growth this year, versus kind of where it has been, what do you think the main drivers there has been? Is it in more of the -- is it more of a combination of economics or is it more of the agent populous of the IT professionals at the local level? 
John Marr: It’s different for -- what’s interesting and what we’re pleased with is that somewhere around and even split of those customers have come from the new business market and the other side coming from existing long-term customers, really. And I think the catalysts of those decisions are different.
 So, when somebody comes to us in the first place or buys our system in the first place the catalyst generally is, as we’ve discussed, that they’ve got the deferred pent-up demand and they a system that really is reaching a point that it isn’t reliable and still 80% of those purchase on-premise because they have the infrastructure and they have the people, the IT resources, to support that system, although 20% adoption is a glowing percentage of that business for us.
 And what we’re finding in the basis is what you indicated as the latter, which is generally after they have the system sometime and after they have had a relationship with us that they’ve become comfortable with, we'd become a real partner of theirs, then when they have a point where they need to reinvest in their infrastructure or they have their IT professional exiting the workforce, and the people that they’ve been comfortable with supporting their system no longer available to them, that becomes a catalyst.
 They say, hey, instead of making that significant investment or instead of trying to find new IT specialists that don’t know our specific needs the way the people that have been here 20, 30 years know, they go and take a look at the SaaS offering and partnering with us on that.
 Obviously, our inside sales channel looks for those symptoms and offers SaaS transition as that approaches. So, again, the catalyst for our new clients versus transitional clients are little bit different. And we’re pleased that, that keeps moving along very nicely. 
Operator: And the next question comes from Jonathan Ho at William Blair. 
Jonathan Ho: Guys, could you talk a little bit about what you’re seeing the competitive environment today and maybe talk a little bit about your win rate by segment? 
John Marr: Yes. Little bit, not too much into the competitive nitty-gritty, but I think in the courts area, especially in the higher-end deals, we probably have one of our strongest positions. We lost a couple of deals we would have liked a few years ago, but I think in the last 2 years or so we’re pretty much won all the important deals that we were involved in, so we’re very strong there. The product has always been strong there, but I think at this point our record on executing on the projects in a risk-adverse environment is very valuable to us as well.
 Obviously, it’s a broader market when you move to the financial systems and our biggest market there with a lot of different players. We’ve improved our win rates from, in real round numbers, from around 1/3 to around 1/2, which is a significant move, modestly better market. So we’re seeing a higher level of business there.
 I think pricing pressure has become a little more of an issue, so I think the reasons for losses have been more cost-oriented over the last year or so then quality of the software or reference ability are the traditional decision points.
 Tax and appraisal will probably improve modestly as well. We’ve had a kind of a re-look or improved user experience there that has definitely had some traction and done well in recent decisions as well. 
Jonathan Ho: Got it. And can you talk a little bit about sort of your expectations around the e-filing revenue? I mean, you gave some metrics in terms of the growth, but it seems like there probably are some system spends that are going to get taken later on this year. So, how should we think about growth in that business for the rest of 2012? 
Brian Miller: We talked about broadly that it’s kind of north of 40% growth rate on our subscriptions. That’s certainly a component, and I think that will grow much in line with our overall subscription growth.
 There a number of clients that are in various stages of ramp-ups. With new e-filing customers, there typically is fairly long ramp up period particularly between the time the system is implemented and the time that the jurisdiction may make use of it mandatory, and certainly the adoption rates go up significantly when it becomes mandatory.
 And so, we have clients like the State of New Mexico that are moving towards that mandatory status. We’ve got clients some like some of our clients in the State of Minnesota that there are in pilot project situations. And so, we do have projects in the -- or customers in the pipeline that are moving towards that higher level of business and so, I think that we would expect to grow in that 30% to 40% range this year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Raghavan Sarathy of Dougherty & Company. 
Raghavan Sarathy: I have 2 questions, first one is for John. John, you talked about modest improvement in the market conditions. Customers are looking at some of the deferred projects. Can you give us some sense for how this is translated into RPs or perhaps if you can quantify what you’re seeing in terms of RPs in the market in the current conditions? 
John Marr: RP activity the last couple of years has been off about 30% from the environment before the recession, if you will. And it’s probably up in between 10% and 15% range from that level. So, it’s recovered somewhat, but not back to where it was before. 
Raghavan Sarathy: Okay. And then a question for Brian. You included $10 million of additional revenue from acquisition. Can you give us some sense of where that might fall among license services and maintenance? Is it mostly maintenance or did you sell new licenses? 
Brian Miller: There is some new license business and we did give the breakdown in the call in terms of how much of the new -- of each revenue line in the quarter came from acquisition. But these businesses are primarily maintenance oriented there similar to the rest of our business. And just a second, I’ll give you a little bit more of the split.
 In total those businesses, UniFund, CSA and Windsor, generate about in the range of $15 million in maintenance out of, say, $24 million in total revenues. And we’re not sure exactly how that fall out this year because of the maintenance haircut we take in the first year with purchase accounting. But in the range of $15 million of maintenance out of $24 million of revenues, and the balance of the revenues are fairly evenly split between new licenses and professional services. 
Operator: Next question comes from Brian Kinstlinger at Sidoti. 
Brian Kinstlinger: Yes. First maybe, John, can you give us a ballpark, you mentioned about a $1.5 million from e-filing revenue a quarter. If you were -- I tried to ask this once before I think, but if you were to put all of your customers in courts on e-filing, what is that general market opportunity. Is that in the $50 million to $100 million range or is it significantly smaller than that? 
John Marr: Well, its $1.5 million for the quarter, so our annual run rate is around $5 million now. If all of them are on, it would certainly be a multiple of that. I don’t think it would be $50 million, maybe in the $20 million range, but I don’t really have that number. As Brian indicated, a big thing is whether or not it’s mandatory.
 So to simply implement e-filing and just see what the adoption is, you’re going to have relatively low adoption or it’s going to take a very, very long time to ramp that up. So what’s critical is not just to get the clients to adopt it, but to pass some legislation where it’s mandatory, at least for certain types of filings.
 And then, obviously, the adoption is very high, and the ramp up happens very quickly. So it’s kind of a 2-tier process to get the courts to want to do it and agree to do it, but have them also lobby for the legislation that makes it mandatory. 
Brian Kinstlinger: And then, how many of your 8 states are going through any mandatory legislation processing? And then the last question, organic sales, organic growth in software license was 4%. You won a lot of large deals at the end of last year, do you expect that will accelerate throughout the year? 
John Marr: I don’t know how many are going through the legislation. Do you Brian have any information on that? 
Brian Miller: I don’t know. I know New Mexico is currently mandatory or it has made it mandatory, but there is a phase-in period. A couple of states we currently have, and I think North and South Dakota, are on -- have e-filing that they purchased it on a license basis. And I don’t believe we’re doing e-filing in New Hampshire, Indiana. Minnesota is working towards the pilot project now.
 So, I think it’s really right now only -- and then it’s been -- we have an agreement with Maryland that obviously hasn’t implement it yet. So, I think there is only one of our states that’s really fully on the mandatory and I’m not sure what the status on the rest of them are. 
John Marr: On the licenses, we would expect higher growth than that throughout the year, although it’s always the hardest number to project. Some of it's in backlog and some of it -- has better visibility, but there is always a component of it that is more sell and deliver and recognize.
 And then, obviously, it’s hard to project new business in terms of what’s going to be SaaS versus traditional and obviously if it’s SaaS, we’re fine with that, but that could put some -- it could keep the growth to a lower level. But our current expectation is that the growth for the year would be at a higher level than what we saw in the first quarter. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Charlie Strauzer at CJS Securities. 
Charles Strauzer: Brian, just a quick follow-up on SaaS. Just what percent of revenue in the quarter was SaaS? 
Brian Miller: In terms of actual SaaS posted clients? 
Charles Strauzer: Yes. In terms of the revenue you got from SaaS, what percent of revenue do you think it was in the quarter roughly? 
Brian Miller: That’s about 10%, about 12% of the revenue in the quarter I think was SaaS with total subscriptions. And of that, it’s about -- when you take out the e-filing and online payments, the real SaaS type arrangements was just shy of $7 million in the quarter. 
Operator: At this time there appear to be no more questions. Mr. Marr, I will turn the call back over to you for closing remarks. 
John Marr: Okay. Thank you, Amy. And thank you for joining us on the call today. If you do have any future questions, feel free to call Brian or myself. Have a great day. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.

===== 2011 Q4  (2012-02-23 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello and welcome to today's Tyler Technologies Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2011 Conference Call. Your host for today's call is John Marr, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, February 23, 2012. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Marr. Please go ahead, sir. 
John Marr: Thank you, Lori. And welcome to our fourth quarter 2011 earning's call. With me on the call today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like for Brian to give the Safe Harbor statement then I'll have some preliminary comments and Brian will give a review the details of our operating results. Then I'll have some final comments and we'll take your questions. Brian? 
Brian Miller: Thanks, John. During the course of this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information. It may include projections concerning the company's future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. John? 
John Marr: This quarter marks our 43rd consecutively profitable quarter. By many measures, it was our best quarter ever as we reached new quarterly highs in revenues, gross margins and backlog. Our fourth quarter financial performance built upon a trend of improving financial results that began in the second quarter this year as the marketplace began to show signs of modest improvement. Total revenues for the quarter were a record high $82.1 million, driven by continued strong growth in recurring revenues from subscriptions and maintenance. 
 In addition, our software license revenue grew by 16% over the same period in 2010, which is the first quarter of growth for software license revenues since the fourth quarter of 2009. Also our gross margin percentage improved by 250 basis points compared to the same period last year to 47.5%, bolstered by continued strong growth in our recurring revenues of subscriptions and maintenance. 
 Tyler announced a number of significant contracts during the fourth quarter. We signed a contract with the State of Maryland for our Odyssey Court Management System as the single, integrated environment for management and reporting court information statewide. The contract was the second statewide Odyssey deal of the year following the contract with the State of Oregon in the second quarter. The Maryland contract is valued at approximately $45 million, which includes software license fees, professional services and a multi-year maintenance agreement. And it is the largest software contract in the company's history. The implementation includes a broad range of Odyssey modules including case manager, enterprise content management, financial management and e-filing. Other significant contracts from Munis ERP solution included the Pasco County School District in Florida, which totaled a value of almost $8 million, our largest ERP contract of the year. A $3.4 million contract with the Guam Department of Education and other contracts with Ottawa County, Michigan, the fast growing county in Michigan and Culver City, California. 
 We also announced a 3-year SaaS agreement with Meridian Behavioral Health Services in North Carolina for our Munis ERP Solution. We signed the SaaS agreement for our Incode ERP solution with the City of Eugene, Oregon. We announced the agreement for our Versatrans student transportation management solution with Ohio's Columbus City Schools, Ohio's largest school district and a client that already uses our Munis ERP Solution. 5 more Texas counties joined 28 existing counties using our Eagle Land and Vital Records Management Solution. These Texas counties included Brazoria, Clay, Jasper, Loving and Randall. 
 In mid-October, we completed the acquisition of Windsor Management Group which provides an integrated suite of financial and human capital management solutions with the K-12 educational market through its flagship product, Infinite Visions. Windsor had annual revenues in 2010 of approximately $12 million including approximately $8 million in recurring revenue. Windsor has over 800 school district clients in 31 states with the concentration in western states such as Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado where Tyler does not currently have a significant K-12 presence. This acquisition broadens our geographical reach in K-12 schools and adds meaningful recurring revenue from a single competitive product suite. 
 We're pleased with the yearly performance of Windsor, which contributed approximately $2.6 million in revenue in the fourth quarter. Subsequent to year-end, we announced the acquisition of Akanda Innovation Incorporated of Toronto, Canada. Akanda has been a partner of our appraisal and tax group since 1997, developing complementary modules to Tyler's IAS World appraisal and tax software. The Akanda team will continue to provide expertise from a wide variety of technical disciplines including GIS, browser-based and workflow technologies. Because virtually all of Akanda's revenues already passed through Tyler as a third party software provider, the acquisition will not have a material effect on our revenues. 
 We entered 2012 with a record backlog and an active sales pipeline. Bookings were, again, very strong in the fourth quarter and new RFPs continue to come in to the marketplace at a steady level. We are cautiously optimistic that we will continue to see a modest improvement in the market that will provide a favorable environment for Tyler to continue to expand its growth. Now, I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter. 
Brian Miller: Thanks, John. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the fourth quarter ended December 31st, 2011. You've seen the press release, I'm going to comment on some of the key factors in the quarter then move on to John's comments on the current quarter and our outlook for 2012. Revenues for the fourth quarter were $82.1 million, a new quarterly high, up 13.3% compared to $72.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2010. Organic revenue growth was 9.7% this quarter led by increases on our recurring revenues for maintenance and subscriptions as well as growth in our software license revenue for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2009. 
 Our acquisition of Windsor Management Group in October accounted for revenues of $2.6 million in the fourth quarter or 3.6 percentage points of the growth. Software license revenues grew 16.1% from last year's fourth quarter and were the highest since the fourth quarter of 2009. Organic growth in licenses was 9.9%. And Windsor added 6.2% of growth in licenses. 
 Subscriptions continue to be our fastest-growing revenue line and grew 43.6%, virtually all organic. In the fourth quarter, we added 9 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 12 existing installed clients compared to a total of 11 new arrangements and 16 conversions in the fourth quarter of 2010. The subscription lines also includes a growing revenue stream from transaction-based revenues such as e-filing in the courts and online payments. In the fourth quarter, these revenues totaled $2 million up from $1.3 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Software services revenues increased by 7.2% of which 4.5% was organic and 2.7% resulted from the Windsor acquisition. 
 Organic growth was primarily driven by increased contract signings during the year. Maintenance revenue growth was 13.5% of which 8.6% was from organic growth due to a combination of new revenues associated with license sales in the past year and annual rate increases for existing clients. Our maintenance revenue growth rate has been reduced somewhat by the effect of existing installed clients converting to our hosted offerings, which results in a loss of maintenance revenue offset by a larger increase in subscription revenue. The acquisition of Windsor contributed 4.9% to the maintenance growth in the fourth quarter. Together, recurring revenues from subscriptions and maintenance comprised 58.3% of our total revenues from the fourth quarter and grew 18.1% year-over-year. 
 Appraisal services revenue decreased 8.0% in the fourth quarter primarily due to the wind down of activity on several revaluations of contracts that began in late 2009 and mid-2010, including a number of Indiana counties in a major revaluation project in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. 
 For the fourth quarter of 2011, our blended gross margin increased 250 basis points to 47.5%, which represents our highest quarterly gross margin ever. Last year's fourth quarter gross margin was 45%. Gross margin for our software licenses increased with a higher level of license revenues and the blended software services maintenance and subscriptions margin increased 240 basis points, reflecting the high degree of leverage in the incremental recurring revenues. 
 SG&A expense was 25.8% of total revenue compared to 23.7% in last year's fourth quarter. The increase in SG&A was mainly attributable to higher incentive compensation accruals in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the same quarter in 2010. For the 2011 full year, SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue was 24.5% compared to 24.1% for 2010. Non-cash stock compensation expense was $1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. $222,000 was included in cost of revenues and $1.5 million was included in SG&A expense. 
 Net research and development expense decreased 24.3% in the quarter to $2.6 million compared to $3.5 million for the same period last year. Total gross R&D expense before the effect of Microsoft reimbursements was $4.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to $4.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. R&D expense was offset by cost reimbursement recognized under our agreement with Microsoft of $2.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 and $1.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. 
 For the full year of 2011, gross R&D expense related to the Microsoft Dynamics project was approximately $8.1 million, which was offset by total reimbursement of $3.5 million for a net expense for the year of $4.6 million. For 2010, gross Dynamics R&D expense was $8.4 million, offset by reimbursement of $5.1 million for net expense of $3.3 million. We currently expect additional R&D reimbursement offsets of approximately $1 million in 2012. Although the timing of the reimbursement is subject to change, we currently expect that all to be recorded in the third quarter of 2012. 
 Operating income for Q4 increased 28% to $14.3 million from $11.2 million last year. And our operating margin is 17.4% equaled our highest quarterly level. Net income for the quarter was $8.7 million or $0.27 per diluted share compared to net income of $7.2 million or $0.21 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2010. 
 The fully diluted share count declined in the fourth quarter by approximately 1.9 million shares compared to last year as a result of our stock repurchases. 
 Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 35.6% and for the year was 37.5%. 
 During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 53,000 shares of our common stocks for approximately $1.3 million at an average cost of $24.77 per share. As of December 30 2011, we have 30 million common shares outstanding and authorizations to repurchase up to a total of 1.7 million additional shares. For the full year of 2011, we repurchased 3 million shares of our stock at an average cost of $23.90, for a total cost of $71.8 million, which represents approximately 9.3% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of 2011. 
 Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was $9.0 million compared to $7.4 million for the same period in 2010. For the full year, our free cash flow was $44.2 million in 2011 up 45% from $30.4 million in 2010. Excluding real estate CapEx, our free cash flow was $50.8 million up 60.1% from $31.7 million for 2010. The increase in free cash flow reflects improved receivable collections, higher deferred revenue collections from maintenance and other recurring revenues and lower cash payments for taxes and incentive compensation compared to 2010. 
 Receivables continue to perform well. Day-of-sales outstanding and accounts receivable was 99 days at December 31, 2011. An improvement of 3 days compared to 102 days at December 31 2010. This is up from 88 days at September 30 as billing seasonally peaked in June and December with a high level of maintenance billings followed by collections in the subsequent quarter. 
 Our backlog at December 31, 2011 reached our highest level ever at $339.8 million up to 20.7% compared to $281.4 million at December 31, 2010. Backlog related to our software business which excludes backlog from appraisal services contracts was $319.9 million in the current quarter, a 28.9% increase compared to $248.2 million a year ago. Appraisal services backlog was $19.9 million at December 31, 2011 compared to $33.2 million at December 31, 2010. Backlog at December 31, 2011 included approximately $110.3 million of maintenance compared to about $92.6 million a year ago. 
 Our Q4 bookings were up 24% over Q4 of 2010 and for the full year of 2011, bookings rose 9.2%. With more of our backlog comprised of multi-year subscription agreements as well as certain software contracts that will be multi-year implementations, the timing of the recognition of backlog has lengthened. Approximately 67% of our December 2011 backlog is expected to be recognized during the next 12 months compared to 70% of our December 2010 backlog. 
 On the balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter with $3.3 million in cash and investments and $60.7 million in outstanding borrowings under our $150 million revolving credit facility. At December 31, we had $81 million of availability under the credit agreement. The average interest rate on our borrowings in the quarter was 3.3%. 
 During the fourth quarter, we completed the acquisition of Windsor Management Group. The purchase price was $23.8 million. After netting acquired cash of $7.4 million, we borrowed approximately $16.4 million on a revolver to fund the net cash purchase price. Windsor Management Group contributed $2.6 million in revenues during the fourth quarter. In the first quarter of 2012, we completed the acquisition of Akanda. The purchase price was $2.9 million. And we did not expect this acquisition to have a material impact on revenues or earnings. 
 Our headcount grew by 80 to 2,091 employees at year-end compared to 2,011 at the end of the third quarter of which 64 were added as a result of the Windsor acquisition. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to John for his comments. 
John Marr: Thank you, Brian. Our results for the quarter reflect a continued modest improvement in the marketplace and the stability and steady growth of our recurring revenues, which were approximately 58% of total revenues, as well as our ability to continue to improve our gross margins and to make, what we believe are well timed investments in our existing and future products to maintain and enhance our competitive position in the marketplace. 
 The market conditions in the second half of the year generally improved at least modestly as we started to see opportunities that have been in the pipeline for some time to start make decisions. It's our view that these needs that are all essential are beginning to reach a point that need to be addressed. During the weaker period in the last 2 or 3 years, we've made significant investments in our products and in our view, and as a result of our market share, indicate that we have made significant improvements competitively. 
 Our backlog grew year-over-year for the seventh straight quarter and is at the highest level in our history. With the new business markets slowly improving, the story is very positive with respect to our recurring revenue. We continue to add clients in our SaaS and hosted offerings, including those that are new to Tyler and existing clients who convert to a hosted solution from an in-house Tyler solution. 
 We are also continuing to build revenues from our transaction-based revenue models, including e-filing with our Odyssey File and Serve Solution for courts. We are providing the solution to clients in many cases under our model in which we share in the filing fees collected by the courts. This model enables courts to implement e-filing and realize the efficiencies of eliminating paper from the system with very little upfront costs while funding the solution out of fees generated from the filings. We're now approaching $1 million in quarterly e-filing revenues and have a very active sales effort for e-filing with both new and existing court clients. 
 Both Tyler and other Microsoft partners are now actively selling Microsoft Dynamics AX and are starting to build a direct pipeline. We currently have very little visibility into the pipeline from the Microsoft partner channels in most of the early opportunities that Tyler is pursuing with the Dynamic solution have not yet reached the decision point. Even the current lack of visibility, our current expectation for 2012 is that we will have sufficient revenue to offset the reduction in R&D reimbursement compared to 2011. And that the net expense related to Dynamics for us will be similar to 2011. We do not expect that Dynamics will generate meaningful revenues before 2013. 
 Our 2012 annual guidance is as follows: we currently expect 2012 revenues to be in the range of $350 million to $356 million. We forecast 2012 diluted EPS to be approximately $0.94 to $1.01. Wholly diluted shares for the year are expected to be approximately $32.5 million to $33 million. For the year, estimated pre-tax expense related to stock options and employee stock purchase plan is expected to be $7.4 million or approximately $0.18 per diluted share after taxes. We estimated an effective tax rate for 2012 of approximately 38.5%. We expect our total capital expenditures will be approximately $15 million to $16 million for the year and total depreciation and amortization will be between approximately $11.2 million and $11.7 million. Our board of directors has approved our plans to build a new office facility for our courts and justice division, incorporate staff on the land we purchased in Plano, Texas early last year. We expect that the total cost of the construction will be $16.7 million, of which proximately $9 million will be spent in 2012. Now, we'll take your questions. 
Operator: [Operator instructions] And our first question is from Nathan Schneiderman of Roth Capital. 
Nathan Schneiderman: I was just hoping to get to some clarification. On the backlog and bookings, what would growth rates have looked like without the Maryland Courts contribution there? 
Brian Miller: The Maryland contract in backlog added a little -- there's a little less than $30 million related to that contract in the backlog number at year-end. So, it's about -- a little less than 10% of the total backlog. The contract amounted to about $45 million. And it includes a multi-year maintenance agreement, which is technically renewable after each year even though the full maintenance agreement is in the contract. So, we have not included all the maintenance in the backlog numbers, so it's about 10% of the backlog. 
John Marr: I would say it's something less than -- probably something less than 2% of revenues in the year. 
Nathan Schneiderman: Right. I guess, maybe if you could just comment. It looks like without the courts, the Maryland Courts deal, the bookings would have been down year-over-year. Is that the right way to look at or just how do you think of the way the business transpired during the quarter apart from this particular large deal? 
John Marr: Well, the deal did happen. 
Nathan Schneiderman: Right. I mean, it was great but I was just curious about the rest of your business and... 
John Marr: Yes. But I appreciate -- it obviously is a very substantial deal but obviously at any point in time, if you take the biggest deal of a quarter or year out, it changes things. So, it's a significant deal but it did happen. I guess my observation would be this. We did have 2 very big deals in the year, Maryland and Oregon. And we actually had pretty good sized deals on our other areas. $8 million deal in ERP is a significant deal. So, we're happy that we're getting some traction in kind of a tier one decisions, which has been an objective of ours for some time and we're starting to see that more regularly. And in the case of courts, I think we are a leader in that particular tier. So, that's encouraging. But I think if the question is just what does the broader market look like? It's improved. We've been cautious about that. It started probably in the summer, late in the second quarter and continued through the second half of the year. So, bookings and awards in the second half of the year were strong. I would not attribute that to an awful lot of new business entering the marketplace. We do track this pretty closely in the new business rate. And so, people initiating decision processes is somewhat consistent with where it's been the last 3 years in the environment we've been operating in. What we have seen is that that pipe has become heavier and heavier and we've talked about this on each call and talked about processes becoming longer. They've added due diligence steps in that ROI steps and just been very cautious in this environment that some of those processes have finally reached the end, albeit a longer process and are making decisions. Also, I think there is some pent-up demand, that there was some reluctancy to replace older systems that they knew were near end of life, when at the same time, they may have been eliminating heads and doing things that are politically less popular. And now we're at a point where these are really deferred investments that have to be addressed. So, we're seeing a modest recovery as our view. We're seeing the market behave a little more normally, certainly at lower levels than previous to this environment, but we're encouraged by that. We're also encouraged that during this time, in a way this has worked in our favor, a number of competitors, I think have reduced their investment in R&D and it weakened their position competitively. And Tyler has continued to invest at high levels across the board in our products. And really, across the board, I think our products -- I think we know from the results we follow that our products have improved competitively and our market share really, virtually in all of our more significant products have improved. So, we're encouraged by that. We hope the market behaves and we believe it's going to behave a little more normally. Not a real robust market but enough of a market that behaves normally enough that with this improved competitive position, we feel good about our new business recovering and feel that the licenses that have declined the last 2 years have hit a bottom. And you saw recovery in the fourth quarter and our outlook for 2012 includes higher levels of new customer type revenues reflected in licensing and professional services. 
Nathan Schneiderman: Just one real quick one on Microsoft and then I'll drop off. It seems like your expectations are very, very modest for revenue contribution for 2012. I was just curious about just why do you think it's going to be at such low level given that products are already been out for a while? And is it happening at a slower pace than you originally thought and if so, what are the dynamics that are causing that? 
John Marr: It really isn't. I think people have felt we've been conservative or cautious on our guidance on this, and I need to reinforce that we've been telling the marketplace all along and what we really believe will happen. And I do believe it's playing out consistently with that. Obviously, Microsoft has a huge presence around the world in software and is a powerful player. A lot of those things are what attracted us to this relationship. But the reality of this market remains, and that is that there are long decision processes that really can't be avoided. So, with the release of a product in August or September and at least 6-month sale cycle -- it's very often 9-month, 12-month, 15-month sale cycles. It's going to take some time before you see significant business happening on a regular basis. It has always been our expectation. It's always been our message and that is in fact what's happening. Now, I'm sure there were some people that maybe think things would happen more quickly and certainly would be happy to see deals come in through a different decision process. And I'm sure there'll be some of that but I don't think it'll be that significant. So, consequently, certainly in the early quarters of this year, we've put light revenues in there. And we really believe that's what's appropriate. Maybe we get surprised on the upside and maybe even if it's a little bit below that. It's not that significant in the overall plan. So, I think overall, it doesn't have a major effect on the current year. I will say we're not going to get into naming all their clients and numbers, that's their business, their channel. And other than what they comment on publicly, we probably shouldn't do that. But I know people are anxious to know what the reception is. And the presentations, the demonstrations go well. The product shows well. It's deep. It has the functionality. It's passing the test and we expect it to do well competitively. And there is business. There certainly are a number of new names that are signing up through their channel. Again, I don't think I should get more specific other than when they do. But certainly, you know what, this is not a 0. There are a number of new accounts signing up that are entering the implementation process in there, across a number of different countries. So, that is consistent with our expectation. It's not a lot of dollars, but it's certainly encouraging that it's being well received by the marketplace. We're starting to see new business and we'd expect that to build as we get toward the later part of the year. 
Operator: Our next question is from Tim Quillin of Stephens. 
Timothy Quillin: In terms of your expectations for a relatively backend-loaded year and at least in terms of EPS. Can you talk about the rationale for that? 
John Marr: Go ahead, Brian. 
Brian Miller: Well, part of it has to do, on the EPS side, with the R&D expenditure and the timing of the reimbursement from Microsoft. So this year, we have about $1 million left in reimbursement. And we expect all that to come in the third quarter. So, that's part of the reason. We do expect the revenues to grow throughout the year and to the extent that we do have Microsoft Dynamics revenues built into the plan. We'd expect those to be backend-loaded as well. So, some of that has to do with the timing of the ramp-up of some of the new contracts like the large courts and justice contracts, the timing of things that are in our backlog, expected continued improvement of the market and some of the expense items like the R&D. 
Timothy Quillin: And Brian, is it more on the EPS side or is the revenue going to have the same type of backend loading? 
Brian Miller: The revenues aren't as dramatically backend-loaded as the earnings side. But we do expect the revenues to be more heavily loaded towards the second half of the year. 
Timothy Quillin: Okay. And is the gross R&D expense of about $4.8 million that you saw in 4Q, is that a good run rate to think about throughout 2012, or will it trend a little bit higher than that? 
Brian Miller: No. I think the resources we have devoted to R&D are pretty much at the level we expect them to be this year. So, I'd say in that high $4 million to around $5 million a quarter is an appropriate range for our gross R&D this year. 
Timothy Quillin: Okay and then on the SaaS business. You've been able to leverage your investments real well over the course of 2011. Is there any additional headcount or resources you need to devote there in 2012? 
John Marr: There's a couple heads but it's not a big number. I mean, it does grow steadily as that business expands but certainly, there's a lot of leverage in that model. So, there are maybe 2 or 3 heads in the year in the facility. 
Timothy Quillin: Okay, great. And then finally -- and Brian, you alluded to this but how should we think about the timing of the Oregon and Maryland deals and type, and sort of the buckets of revenue that we should see especially in 2012? 
Brian Miller: As we have said when we announced the contract, they are multi-year implementations. They run 5 to 6 years, their percentage of completion accounting. So, the licenses are recognized as the professional services are provided. Oregon started activity in the second half of 2011 and we'll be ramping up through 2012. Maryland is really just now getting started. And they're not all incremental revenue. So, they're replacing -- to some extent they're replacing other projects that are finishing up, other Odyssey implementations in large counties and other states that we've had going. So, while we expect courts and justice revenues to grow this year, it's somewhat in line with our overall growth. So, we think it'll be a steady ramp-up but not a dramatic increase in the level that we're at now. 
Operator: The next question is from Jonathan Ho of William Blair. 
Jonathan Ho: The first question for me is on sort of your thoughts around software license revenue growth for 2012. I know that it picked up in the fourth quarter and signs seem to be improving. But what is your outlook at this point just given the change in mix? 
John Marr: Yes. I think what we saw in the fourth quarter is sustainable but that level is probably a better baseline now than the lower level we've experienced the last couple of years and marginal growth from that level would be pretty consistent with the plan. 
Jonathan Ho: Got it. And then can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment and potentially your win rate. And you've talked a little bit about the investments that you guys have made and potentially some improvements there. But I just want to get a sense of what you're seeing on a relative win-rate position? 
John Marr: Yes. We're careful about how granular we get publicly on that because we do invest a lot in bails [ph] option in understanding that marketplace, don't need to do that work for our competitors. But there isn't any question that our experience in the marketplace, certainly the last 6 months of 2011 and into this year is measurably better than what it was the previous 18 months. And that would be really across the board. The courts had a couple of losses from the period to year to 2.5 years ago. They certainly were our leader but lost a few deals that we would like to have won. And I don't feel we've lost a meaningful deal in the last year or so. And that's reflective of investments we've made in the product and the reference ability of our clients. The same is true for both of our leading financial systems, the Version 10 Incode System and the Munis System that we've made good investments directed at competitive situations in the marketplace where we thought we could improve. And the results support that we've made that move. So, I really look at the last few years as an environment where you simply weren't able to have the level of growth that you might like or that would have been consistent with our historical performance. But we did okay. But the real benefit has been if our long term objective is to be a clear leader in this space, then I think we've made more progress toward that recently than maybe is reflected financially. 
Operator: [Operator instructions] Our next question is from Raghavan Sarathy of Dougherty & Company. 
Raghavan Sarathy: My first question is about the guidance. So, you are guiding for a strong revenue growth for the year, but it appears that there isn't going to be much in the way of margin expansion to see [ph] it. I understand that Microsoft is going to have some impact on your margin, maybe 60, 70 basis points. But I was wondering if you could help us understand some of the puts and takes impacting the margin expansion this year. 
Brian Miller: Well, we have a couple of headwinds and Microsoft, as you mentioned, is one of those. So with the reimbursement going away, roughly $2.5 million less reimbursement in 2012 than we had in 2011. Effectively, we have the Microsoft revenues in the plan or some amount of those in the plan with effectively no margin because we're starting with the increased cost on them. It's probably maybe a little bit north of what you said. So maybe close to somewhere between 75 and 100 basis points. Maybe closer to 100 basis points of margin that we sort of start out with a headwind on. There's also a fairly significant expected decline in our appraisal services margin. We expect the revenues to be relatively flattish on our appraisal services business. But the mix of the project is changing a bit. We've enjoyed rather high margins in the last couple of years on appraisal services, kind of above our historic levels. And I think our margin in 2011 on appraisal services was over 37%. We expect that the 2012 revenues will be at our more normal levels for that business of the low 30s -- more on the 31-ish, 32% range. So that might be a 40, 50 basis point on a blended margin hit for us. And then with some revenues from the Windsor acquisition, a little bit of pressure there because of the -- at least on the operating side, it's generating nice cash flow but we do have on a GAAP basis that depreciation and amortization, the amortization related to the acquisition intangibles. And so that puts a little bit of pressure on margins as well. So, those are a bit of the headwinds. And again, depending on if you look at where we thought if we thought the low end of the revenue range but the high end of the EPS range, then you obviously get a better margin. And that if we're at the other sides of those, there's a little bit more difficulty in getting the normal growth there. 
Raghavan Sarathy: Okay. And then I noticed that services revenues declined sequentially. Is there a particular reason for it or simply a lag in license revenue and it should picked up given you'd be working on the 2 larger deals this year? 
Brian Miller: Well, it lags is a little bit behind license revenues. And certainly we saw the decline come a little bit after that. The other thing on the services side in the fourth quarter, I think last year we saw a decline from Q3 to Q4 as well. It's relatively modest. It went down about $400,000 this year. Last year, the services decline was around $700,000. And most of that from Q3 to Q4 is seasonal, related to the holidays between Thanksgiving and Christmas to the end of the year. There's a little less billable time because of our people as well as clients taking time off for the holidays. 
Raghavan Sarathy: Okay, just 2 final questions. How does the pipeline look for the court and justice? You did close 2 large statewide deals last year. That was a pleasant surprise. Can you talk about the pipeline for courts and justice? And then one for Brian, how much license revenue do you expect to recognize on backlog? 
John Marr: The pipeline is healthy. It's fine. There aren't going to be sudden expectation that there'll be a lot of Maryland, but there certainly are some statewide deals out there. It'll be hard to predict the timing of those. But there are other processes for states to look at statewide implementations. And there certainly are number of new business opportunities with significant counties. There's also an opportunity with our broader base of products including e-filing to continue to sell add-on products into our growing base. So, we're comfortable that they'll continue to bring in new business as they work through the backlog. 
Brian Miller: In terms of the timing of the backlog, we don't break out the licenses and services. But combined of the year-end backlog, we expect about $81 million of licenses and services that are currently in -- at year-end backlog to be recognized in 2012 revenues. But we don't split that out between licenses and service component. 
Operator: At this time, there appear to be no more questions. Mr. Marr, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks. 
John Marr: Okay. Well, thank you, Lori. And thank all of you for joining us on our earnings call today. If there are any further questions, please feel free to call Brian or me. Have a great day.

Operator: Welcome to today’s Tyler Technologies third quarter 2008 earnings conference call. Today’s call is being recorded. Your host for today’s call is John Marr, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. 
John S. Marr, Jr. : Welcome to our third quarter 2008 earnings call. With me on the call today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First I’d like for Brian to give the Safe Harbor statement and then I’ll have some preliminary comments and Brian will review the details of our operating results. Then I’ll have some final comments and then we’ll take your questions.
Brian K. Miller : During the course of this conference call management may make statements that provide information other than historical information and may include projections concerning the company’s future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projects. We refer you to our Form 10K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks.
John S. Marr, Jr. : The third quarter 2008 has proven to be very strong across the board at Tyler. We are pleased we posted our 30th consecutive profitable quarter. These results are a testament that our strategies and business model are sound and our products are competitive and that Tyler’s nearly 2,000 employees are executing at an exceptional level.  Our third quarter and year-to-date results exceeded our expectations by a substantial margin with nearly 25% revenue growth in the quarter and 22% year-to-date. As importantly, the revenue mix has been favorable with higher margin licenses, recurring maintenance and subscription services leading the way. All this delivered new quarterly highs and several key measures including total revenues, operating income, EBITDA and free cash flow excluding our real estate acquisition. In fact, our free cash flow continues to be exceptional. In the quarter we saw an 81% increase in free cash flow excluding the real estate acquisition. Later on the call we’ll review our latest guidance but through September 30 our actual trailing 12 month results are revenues of $256 million, earnings per share of $0.60 before the legal settlement and $0.40 after the settlement and free cash flow of $50.3 million before real estate acquisitions.  Now, I’d like for Brian to provide more detail on the results of the quarter.
Brian K. Miller : This morning Tyler Technologies reported its results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2008. This was financially our best quarter ever by most measures with very strong earnings and even strong cash flow. You all have access to the press release and our Form 10Q has now been filed so I am going to limit my comments and focus on providing an analysis on the key factors contributing to our results this quarter and then move on to John’s comments on the current quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year as well as Q&A. Revenues for the third quarter were $68.6 million, up 24.9% from the third quarter 2007. Our organic growth for the quarter was approximately 15% and about 10 percentage points of our growth was the result of acquisitions we’ve made over the past 12 months. We posted double digit revenue growth across all of our software related revenue lines. Software licenses were up 40% and topped $11 million for the second straight quarter.  Licenses from our Odyssey Courts & Justice solution was the biggest contributor to the license revenue increase and included some license revenues that had previously been deferred pending the achievements of certain milestones. Licenses from other products such as financial management and education systems and appraisals on tax systems also increased year-over-year.  Subscription revenues grew 38% over last year’s third quarter reflecting revenues from new customers as well as existing customers that have converted to our ASP model. During the quarter we signed two new ASP customers and converted eight existing customers. Growth in the base of customers subscribing to our disaster recovery services also contributed to the increase.  Maintenance revenue growth was 28% with acquisitions accounting for approximately 11% of the growth and the other 17% organic. Together recurring revenues from subscriptions and maintenance comprised over 45% of our total revenues for the third quarter in addition to a substantial amount of service revenues that are attributable to existing customers. Software services revenues grew 17% with increases across each of our major product categories.  Finally, appraisal services revenue increased 7% in the third quarter after showing year-over-year declines in the previous three quarters primarily due to the ramp up of the revaluation project in New Orleans. For the third quarter 2008 our blended gross margin increased 420 basis points to 43.6% compared to 39.4% in last year’s third quarter. The strong improvement is attributable to a more favorable revenue mix and particularly the high level of license revenues and operating leverage including improved staff utilization that contributed to higher margins across each revenue category. Sequentially gross margins increased 50 basis points from 43.1% in the second quarter of 2008. SG&A expenses were 23.3% of revenue and 23.1% for the same period in 2007. The incremental SG&A expense related to acquisitions was primarily responsible for the slight increase in SG&A as a percentage of revenue. Net research and development expense was $1.4 million for the third quarter of 2008 compared to $639,000 for the same period last year. The increase is primarily due to staffing increases associated with our joint development effort with Microsoft on the dynamic [AXERP] for the public sector. Research and development expense for the third quarter of 2008 includes $857,000 of cost reimbursement recognized under the amended research and development agreement with Microsoft. R&D in the third quarter of 2007 was offset by reimbursement by Microsoft of $883,000.  We have recently revised our agreement with Microsoft to define the scope of reimbursable developments through the balance of the project and we now expect to offset R&D expense by approximately $850,000 each quarter through the end of 2010. Operating income was $11.9 million and nearly 51% increase from the third quarter 2007. As we discussed last quarter we settled outstanding litigation related to SOX purchase warrants and recorded a non-cash charge of $9 million in the second quarter of this year. This charge was not tax deductable and had the effect of significantly increasing our effective tax rate for the second quarter and each subsequent quarter in 2008 as we must allocate the tax impact respectively for the 2008 calendar year. In order to more clearly present our operating results on a comparable basis, in addition to GAAP income numbers we have also provided non-GAAP results that have excluded the effects of the non-cash [inaudible] settlement.  A reconciliation of earnings before the effect of the legal settlement to GAAP income is included in our earnings press release. For the third quarter of 2008, the impact of the legal settlement resulted in an effective tax rate of 48.4% and additional income tax of $1.5 million. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter excluding the income tax effects of the legal settlement was $7.8 million or $0.20 per diluted share, an increase of 52% compared to net income of $5.2 million or $0.12 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2007. Including the impact of the legal settlement, GAAP net income for the quarter was $6.4 million or $0.16 per diluted share. As we have discussed before, our business model has very attractive cash flow characteristics that consistently produce annual cash flow well in excess of GAAP earnings. That certainly was the case in the third quarter when cash from operations was $27.5 million, an increase of 74.3% from $15.7 million for the same period in 2007. The third quarter is historically our highest cash flow quarter of the year because we invoice a significant portion of our annual maintenance and support in June and collect much of that cash in the third quarter. We also collected cash on contracts containing milestone billing schedules and reduced our DSOs so total receivables grew at a much lower rate than deferred revenues. Before capital expenditures for real estate acquisitions, free cash flow for the quarter was $26.6 million compared to $14.7 million in 2007. Our total capital expenditures during the third quarter were $13.9 million of which $13 million was associated with real estate for the company’s future office space requirements. So, free cash flow after all cap ex including real estate was $13.6 million for the quarter. Cap ex for the third quarter last year was $1 million. We also expect to complete the purchase of our office facility in [Fallis Lane] for approximately $10 million in cash during the fourth quarter of this year.  For the first nine months of this year, cash flow from operations was $45.4 million compared to $24.5 million for the same period in 2007. The year-to-date free cash flow for 2008 excluding the real estate acquisitions if $41.9 million versus $21.8 million for the first nine months of 2007. We did not capitalize any software development costs this quarter and amortization of post acquisition software development costs was $975,000 in the third quarter down from $1.1 million in last year’s third quarter. Our backlog at September 30, 2008 was $235.6 million up approximately 4% compared to $225.8 million at September 30, 2007 and down slightly from $238 million at June 30, 2008. Backlog related to our software business which excludes backlog from appraisal services contracts was $209.8 million at September 30th, an increase of $11.7 million or 6% from September of last year.  Appraisal services backlog was $25.7 million at September 30, 2008 compared to $27.6 million at September 30, 2007 and $22.9 million at June 30, 2008. As we have built up our implementation capacity over the past few quarters we’ve been successful in bringing down the level of backlog for certain products including our Odyssey Court System to more closely align with clients’ desire to implementation time tables. As we’ve discussed in the past we’ve had two primary uses of our free cash flow in addition to substantial ongoing investments in our products that are expensed either in cost of maintenance or as R&D expense. One of those uses of cash is our stock repurchase program. We’ve been a very consistent buyer of our own stock for several years. We have a long term outlook when considering the valuation of our stock and with the recent upheaval in the market we believe our stock is a particularly compelling value.  During the third quarter we repurchased 1,097,000 shares of common stock at a total cost of $16.9 million. For the first nine months of this year we’ve purchased a total of 2,194,000 shares at a cost of $31.3 million. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter we have purchased an additional 1.5 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $20.6 million. We now have about 36.3 million basic shares outstanding. Last week our board of directors increased by 2 million shares our repurchase authorization so we may currently repurchase up to approximately 2,068,000 additional shares of our common stock. It’s remarkable to look at the accretive impact of our stock repurchases since we began buying out stock back six years ago. Since the beginning of 2002 we have repurchased a total of 17.4 million shares of Tyler stock at an average cost of $7.86 per share. The second use of our cash flow has been for acquisitions. We completed one acquisition during the third quarter acquiring School Information Systems, Inc. for $9.9 million in cash and 70,492 shares of common stock. SIS is based on St. Louis and provides financial and student information management systems for public school districts with 275 school districts and customers primarily located in Missouri and Illinois. We expect to expand the reach of SIS’ product suite in to additional states as part of the Tyler organization.  On the balance sheet we ended the third quarter of 2008 with $34.3 million in cash and investments and no debt. Days sales outstanding in accounts receivable at September 30, 2008 improved to 87 days compared to 93 days at September 30, 2007. This represents the lowest DSO level in six quarters. We also announced today that we’ve established a new revolving bank credit facility that provides for total borrowing of up to $25 million in addition to a $6 million facility for cash secured letters of credit. Borrowings under this one year facility will bear interest at either LIBOR plus 1% or prime rate minus 1.5%. We established the line of credit to provide additional working capital availability to ensure we have the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities with respect to potential M&A activity as well as stock repurchases and capital expenditures. We also continue to consider leveraging our real estate assets once we complete those acquisitions. Now, I’d like to turn the call back over to John for his comments on the quarter.
John S. Marr, Jr. : As you now know our results were strong. It is important to appreciate that this represents a broad based success. There really is no unusual or single event that is responsible but rather consistent execution across the entire business. Our balance sheet is evident of strong cash flow characteristics of our business. At September 30 we had $34 million in cash after investing over $68 million in cash year-to-date for acquisitions, stock repurchases and real estate. So, the company has seen considerable growth in revenues with leverage and even better growth in earnings and free cash flow before the real estate. And, as importantly, we believe we are making investments that will in turn, turn those earnings and free cash flow in to shareholder value downstream. We’re enjoying a very good 2008 but I appreciate in the current environment that most are interested in looking forward. I wish I could tell you exactly what the next year and beyond would look like, I can’t. But, I will offer some observations from our perspective. First, our company is built on strong fundamentals, nearly half of our revenues are recurring with less than 2% customer attrition and in these times customer loyalty will only strengthen. We have a strong backlog, $235 million at September 30. There are other considerable revenues that we execute every year that are relatively certain but not represented in either of these numbers. In our view, with all this considered there’s a core level of reliable business that we can count on that will support reasonable results even in these extraordinary times. Tyler also enjoys a strong balance sheet and excellent free cash flow resulting in very little exposure to the volatile credit markets. It is likely that all markets including local government will be affected by the economic conditions we are experiencing. To what extent and at what time is something that is hard to predict but as with our own business internal fundamentals, the fundamentals of the local government software market will be favorable over the long term. For years now local government has been asked to do more with less and the current environment will only hasten this trend. Our products and services are not discretionary choices of local government but the tools they use to be more efficient and actually deliver more with less. There is a tremendous inventory of old systems out there nearing the point of unreliability; they need to be replaced. Is there some discretion as to whether that occurs next year or further down the road? Yes. Is there any question that it needs to occur sometime in the reasonable future? No. So no, I can’t tell you exactly what things will look like a year from now but given our large customer base, our recurring revenue, strong backlog and excellent competitive position I believe we will continue to delivery decent results. Think about it, our free cash flow and our EBITDA are greater than our total license revenue. I’m confident this will allow us to manage through these times. But more importantly, the fundamentals of our market are strong. Local government will make some adjustments and it could, could create some short term pressure. But, this will be a bigger marketplace three and five years from now. These governments as group will be bigger, not smaller. Their need for our solutions will be strong and we will be in an increasingly strong position to serve those needs. This morning we also announced that we recently put a new bank revolving credit in place. This affords us the ability to pursue attractive acquisition opportunities, continue our repurchase program as well as invest aggressively in our products.  Our ability to obtain this line in these times with attractive terms is indicative of our strong financial position. Based on our strong performance year-to-date and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we have revised upward our guidance for the full year 2008. We current expect 2008 revenues to be in the range of $262 million to $265 million. We forecast 2008 diluted earnings per share to be approximately $0.57 to $0.60.  Before the non-cash settlement pertaining to the warrants, earnings of 34% to 37% including the settlement. Fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be approximately $39 million to $39.5 million. For the year estimated pre-tax expense related to stock options and the employee stock purchase plan is expected to be $3.5 million or approximately $0.07 per diluted share after taxes. We estimate an effective tax rate for 2008 of approximately 38% before the impact of the legal settlement and 49.9% including the settlement. We expect free cash flow for the year to be within a range of $22 million to $26 million with total cap ex of approximately $30 million to $31 million for the year and total depreciation and amortization of approximately $12 million. Excluding real estate cap ex we expect free cash flow to be between $48 million and $53 million. Now, we’ll take questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Charlie Strauzer – CJS Securities.
Charlie Strauzer – CJS Securities: A couple questions, they’re pretty straight forward, one is as you’re looking at Q4 how should we think about the segments and kind of the expected growth by segment there and any real big changes on the gross margin line by segments?
John S. Marr, Jr. : I think Q4 by segment would look very much like Q3 which would mean financial systems continuing to be a strong contributor and of course the justice area having come on line more meaningfully in the third quarter continuing generally at that level. 
Charlie Strauzer – CJS Securities: Then if you look at the gross margins by reporting segment should we see much difference there too?
John S. Marr, Jr. : Not particularly. The biggest change is obviously that the gross margin on the license line varies pretty significantly depending on the revenues because the cost of licenses are relatively thick but otherwise there’s nothing that would point to anything other than the kind of changes in margins you get with volume changes.
Charlie Strauzer – CJS Securities: Then looking out especially on the Microsoft Agreement, Brian if you can highlight what has changed since the last amendment to the agreement? How is this new amendment different from the last one?
John S. Marr, Jr. : The last one has really the spirit of an arrangement in place which was that development we were doing for the public sector system that had value to their commercial or horizontal system that they would have an ability to contract with us to get IP rights to that and pay for it now and move it over there. So, that’s still the basis of our arrangement. But, what really it didn’t address was looking over any reasonable period of time trying to quantify that and come up with an arrangement that was a little more consistent and had better visibility. So, since then we’ve looked at really the balance of the development projects through the first release to manufacturing and quantified that and quantified how much of that has value to them and they choose to include in their commercial system and come up with a much more predictable model so we will have relatively flat reimbursement through general release really through the end of 2010. So that was the major change was trying to look out, quantify it and put in an arrangement in place where they knew what their cost was quarter-to-quarter and we knew what we could expect from a reimbursement standpoint. So, it’s only if we were to see a very material change in the product that that reimbursement would change and we don’t expect that to happen.
Charlie Strauzer - CJS Securities: When you talked to Microsoft and the people there, given all the turmoil of the last couple weeks and months, what are they saying to you in terms of their receptivity from the early client tests that they’ve done and the rollout dates and all those things related to that? What are they saying to you?
John S. Marr, Jr.: I’d say as you might expect. Both companies obviously are at very different levels but both companies are in a position to continue to support these longer term development efforts regardless of the current environment and again at very different levels. But both companies in the last week now have reported strong results and an outlook that is certainly reasonable enough to continue. We don’t expect this project to be affected by the current market. As I indicated earlier, I don’t know how many projects that might have occurred next year might get pushed out a year or two but if they were on the table for next year, they’re going to occur sometime in the next two years. Really if you think of it that way, there could have been some business that would have occurred in the next year or two as we finish up this project that’ll be on the table when the product actually hits general release. I met with them last week. We have similar views of remaining committed to the project, getting it done, it’s on schedule, it’s generally on budget and we think there’ll be a good reception in the market place down the road.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kirk Materne - Bank of America Securities.
Kirk Materne - Bank of America Securities: Maybe taking a look at your guidance for the fourth quarter Brian. When you back into it, it seems that the seasonality from 3Q to 4Q this year versus last year’s a little flatter sequentially. Can you just go into that whether or not there are some deals that came in? I realize you guys don’t give quarter-by-quarter guidance so maybe my [inaudible] was just wrong to begin with, but can you just talk about the trends we should think about maybe from a seasonality perspective from 3Q to 4Q and any suggestions you maybe have for us going forward on that front?
Brian K. Miller: In the past the fourth quarter has typically been a fair amount stronger than any other quarter during the year. I think we’re seeing that starting to move out a little bit and there are less pronounced increases just from seasonality. As we’ve grown, our business is spread across more geographies and across more customers so we see a little bit less of that hockey stick effect in the fourth quarter. In this quarter there were some things that were timing so we increased our guidance for the second half of the year. As you know we don’t give quarterly guidance. We leave that up to the analysts and you guys to put into your models, and some of that’s not actually predictable from quarter-to-quarter in terms of when deals sign and when licenses are recognized. But there was a little bit of timing in terms of things that we might have expected internally to have happened in the fourth quarter that happened in the third quarter that made this quarter a little bit stronger particularly on the license side. But I think over time we are seeing a little bit more of the smoothing of quarter-to-quarter.  Clearly a lot of our revenue’s maintenance and subscriptions, recurring revenue types of things just occur based on time passing rather than deals closing in the quarter.
Kirk Materne - Bank of America Securities: John must have a really great crystal ball into next year especially from a revenue standpoint, but there are some things you guys can control in terms of you do have a good view into maintenance revenue, subscription revenue and sort of your op ex. When you guys have had a nice lift in margins this year, can you just talk about it maybe qualitatively because I know you don’t want to get into guidance for next year but qualitatively about your ability to manage your margins as we head into next year and what our thoughts should be in terms of further margin expansion from these levels as we go into ’09? While I recognize that revenue predictability is going to be very difficult, I’m just trying to get a sense on how closely you guys think you can manage the cost structure of revenue growth for it to trail down a little bit due to the macro factors?
John S. Marr, Jr.: Certainly we’re giving an awful lot of thought to that and we’re in the 2009 planning process and talking an awful lot with the divisional management teams regarding that. If you really look at what we see and touch in our own business as you see from the quarter and the guidance for the balance of the year and that certainly trickles into the beginning of next year, what we see directly is healthy. We don’t want to take off the table objectives we’ve had traditionally for growth and investments and products and these sorts of things if we don’t see those things. On the other hand, obviously you have to be aware of what’s going on externally and you have to acknowledge that it could put some pressure on our space. I think we’re better insulated than most commercial businesses and even better insulated than most government segments but certainly we would appreciate there could be some guidance. We’re really working hard to have a more dynamic plan that does try to achieve what’s available to us in the market place but rather than look at things as an annual plan with some measures along the way, we have an awful lot more in the way of consistently being perceptive as to what’s really happening in the state and have the variable expense increases only go into effect and occur, the hiring of the people and so forth when we can touch and feel those revenues. So it’ll be a much more dynamic plan and it’ll be more aggressively managed. You’re getting right at what is our job and as we see it going forward. I certainly believe our company will have some growth next year. If you just look at the trajectory of maintenance revenues and subscription revenues and backlog of work, there’s growth built in our model as we leave one year and go into the next. But if it’s lower than it would have been, then we need to work hard to protect the margins we’ve achieved which might be the best you can do. And again if there is that final increment that we think we’d realize in ordinary times, then that’s an opportunity obviously for the margin to expand. The net I would say is I think we will certainly see some growth even in a difficult market and I think we’ll have an opportunity to have margins generally in the range that we’re currently experiencing and yet we will have a plan that will look for opportunities for better growth and broadening those margins as well. 
Kirk Materne - Bank of America Securities: John, I know the Federal government’s on a September year end. Can you just go into a little bit of the cadence about when the local government will start putting out RFPs? It might differ by region, but can you just give us some color on that?
John S. Marr, Jr.: There are really two things to consider there. The nice thing is as Tyler as grown geographically around the country, and that’s part of the answer to your earlier question where we’d seen more of a hockey stick and we see more of a leveling out of our revenues and earnings, part of it’s a result of that. There really are three different fiscal cycles around the country. I think the most predominant is a June 30 fiscal year end. So I think that is the most commonly used mostly driven because of the educational side. Second to that would be the calendar year, and third to that would be the fiscal year September 30. I’m not aware of states that have the first quarter as their year end. It is spread out some and balanced a little bit.  The other thing though that has always gone on and is interesting is that different communities and different projects use that different ways. There seem to be a lot of governments that right now are preparing a budget and will put money in that budget. They’ll put $1 million or $2 million or whatever they think is appropriate to replace the system and then once that budget is approved, they’ll begin the process of going out and seeing what they really want and making a selection that’ll occur months later down the road. Then there are others that go out and go through the process and decide exactly what it is they want and how much it’s going to cost, and then they go and get the approval. All of those things combined I think again are contributing to somewhat of a leveling of business as it occurs.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Kinstlinger - Sidoti & Company, LLC.
Brian Kinstlinger - Sidoti & Company, LLC: I appreciate the discussion of uncertainty for next year and I guess my question John for you is, first of all are you beginning to see any pushback yet from customers and how is it impacting pricing at all in the market place?
John S. Marr, Jr.: I haven’t seen a lot of pushback with customers. I think that again they’re understanding that they need to support the investments they have and align those systems, and the fact that they’re not discretionary that’ll remain pretty solid for the customer base. On the new business side there’ll be projects that might happen this coming year and there’ll be incremental applications that might have been sold into our base that may not occur at the same rates. We expect to see some of that. We’ve seen some anecdotal evidence of certain projects being delayed or going off, and we’ve seen maybe some customers looking to purchase something from us, installed customers, but a lot of it’s cultural. It just didn’t feel right probably for that budget share at the current moment.  Again I think the fundamentals of our business and the market place are such that we’ll still make some progress during these times; maybe not at the same level. Pricing can really be a double-edged sword and one side of that is to our favor.  We’ve got very compelling offerings; we’re very cost effective on the higher mid-range and the lower Tier 1 type space; and I think some of the market that was less price sensitive in going with the Tier 1 vendors in some cases at much higher costs we have again seen some anecdotal evidence and heard some comments from some of that market place that the cost itself is going to be a bigger mix of the decision. And that will help us in that particular market place.
Brian Kinstlinger - Sidoti & Company, LLC: To that point, your software license exposure on pace doing a similar quarter at $43 million. Is there anything that is recurring? I know the maintenance and service is very recurring. So when you look to next year, how much of that is either in your backlog if you have to hit certain points in the program and how much has to be new business that you book through the year? Whatever that number is you do next year, how much comes from your backlog versus new business?
John S. Marr, Jr.: There isn’t anything recurring, but Brian do you have the license numbers?
Brian K. Miller: We don’t have the break out of the licenses separately but there is a portion of the licenses that’ll be coming out of backlog particularly on the court field and our property tax in appraisal systems or some of our larger financial systems that either have milestone based revenue recognition on licenses or more often percentage of completion accounting that those are recognized as services provided.
Brian Kinstlinger - Sidoti & Company, LLC: But most of them are new bookings?
Brian K. Miller: I don’t know. We can find out for you.
Brian Kinstlinger - Sidoti & Company, LLC: We’ll get that off line.
Brian K. Miller: It’s certainly a meaningful part comes out of backlog. Whether it’s more than half, I’d have to look.
Brian Kinstlinger - Sidoti & Company, LLC: In relation to the question that the previous gentleman asked, I guess I was confused and this is hypothetical, suppose in the second quarter you did start to feel it. Does that mean you’d be prepared to implement something to cut costs, you’re not sure? I’m’ just trying to understand how quickly you can manage costs while you’re increasing R&D somewhat and SG&A to something actually happening. Could that happen in three months, six months? I remember it was very quick back in the days of the tax and appraisal piece. I’m just curious in today’s market is that similar or not?
John S. Marr, Jr.: Tax and appraisal’s pretty different. We had very high project oriented revenues there and as those projects ran off, they weren’t replaced and we had a lot of resources that weren’t really funded. As I said earlier, and it’s an environment where we want to be very careful about predictions, but the trajectory of our maintenance revenues and our subscription revenues and the size of the customer base that grows significantly year-to-year, all of that suggests that revenues would certainly be higher next year than they are this year. I don’t see, based on what we’re currently seeing, a need for any kind of a reorganization or downsizing of resources. What I see is an environment where we certainly can’t take for granted the growth that we have. We need to watch very closely and if that growth doesn’t materialize and if some of that new license revenue doesn’t materialize that we manage our resources more aggressively and we hold the line more than a reduction. Again I don’t see a situation where revenues would be lower next year than they are this year so it’s really about incremental costs and incremental revenues. That could mean redeploying certain resources from certain areas of our business to other areas of our business. But even if we experienced, and I’m not suggesting we will, a reduction in new license revenue, that reduction would be offset by increases in maintenance and subscriptions and other types of services and we should be able to manage within that without any kind of a significant restructuring.
Brian Kinstlinger - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Related to Microsoft, we have the new agreement here and I’m curious how many guys you have on that development program, where that might go next year and given that they’re going to be reimbursing you $800,000, does that suggest that we won’t be up next year in R&D expense? Will be still be up? That’s the one thing that seems that you do have visibility to. Maybe you can give us a sense of that?
John S. Marr, Jr.: We’ll be up. We’re in the area of 70 FPs right now and that could grow as much as 50% next year. Some portion of that reimbursement will be nearly double next year than it was this year so some reasonable amount of that growth will be offset by higher reimbursement but our costs on the Microsoft project the way it’s currently contemplated will go up a little bit next year; $1.5 million, $2 million, something in that range.
Brian K. Miller: Our backlog at September 30, about 60% of it is licenses and software services with the balance being subscriptions, maintenance and appraisals. So about 60% of that backlog would be license and services. I don’t have the split between the two but it would be reasonable to assume that it wouldn’t be too far off from our overall revenue split, the relationship between licenses and services.
Brian Kinstlinger - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Did you revise the third quarter of last year because in your report you said $198.2 million in software? That would suggest a 5% increase but you said 11% in your prepared remarks.
Brian K. Miller: I don’t have a revision to that but let me go back and look. $226 total backlog and $198 million of non-appraisals.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Yuschak - Sanders Morris Harris.
David Yuschak - Sanders Morris Harris: Let me just ask you about real estate spending this year. When you take a look at your PP&E at the end of the year versus what it is now, obviously that’s a pretty significant commitment you’re making in real estate. Could you give us some sense as to what you envision with this kind of investment because it would certainly potentially demonstrate a lot of capacity to do a lot of things as you put that real estate into productive use?
John S. Marr, Jr.: You mean actually the use of the facilities?
David Yuschak - Sanders Morris Harris: Right.
John S. Marr, Jr.: We have talked about that on a previous call. All the real estate being acquired or built is in two different markets; the Lubbock, Texas market where the [Endco] division has grown and in the main market, [inaudible] where we have our munic area. We’re committed to all the different facilities. As I said we don’t see reorganizations or downsizings of any of those. But as we manage the business going forward there are certain markets that are more productive for us than others and we will try to direct the growth and have directed the growth in those areas. These markets are kind of secondary markets I’d call them. We have a presence in the Dallas/Plano area. We have a presence in Seattle which has been very useful in the Microsoft projects. We have offices on 128 outside of Boston and in Research Triangle in the Carolinas.  We have some good talented contributors in those areas but as we grow a lot of resources, these secondary markets are very cost effective for us. We have good loyalty and longevity among the employees. They’re markets where we’ve been able to attract and retain long-term relationships with employees; we’re an employer of choice in those areas; we don’t experience people going across the street for marginally different pay or that sort of thing. We’ve made a conscious decision that those are good markets for us to grow in and those divisions have been very successful attracting and keeping those people. Probably 100% of one of the buildings in Maine is and has been occupied by Tyler for years so it’s really just buying a building we’re already in and have a significant investment in. That’s where our ASP facility is and a lot of infrastructure is in place. The other building is currently leased out to the seller and as it becomes available, the projection of our growth here would be such that we would be filling that very consistently as it’s re-leased. If you don’t do something like that, you’ve got a lot of employees scattered over a lot of different buildings on a temporary basis and it’s just not as productive an environment. In the Lubbock environment they’re in three different facilities right now; they’re spread out; they’re stuffed into those facilities; and we need to bring them together under one roof so to speak and give them a more productive environment. The reality is there simply doesn’t exist a space that size and that quality in the Lubbock market place so we made the decision to build it.
David Yuschak - Sanders Morris Harris: It does speak too though of the continued optimism you have for your financial product line as well.
John S. Marr, Jr.: That’s right.
David Yuschak - Sanders Morris Harris: As far as the court and justice, at your user conference you indicated there are several states now looking at the potential proposed with RFPs to implement a court and justice system. Could you give us some sense as to some timelines on those because I think there was upward of eight states kind of reviewing prospects for new systems? Could you give us an idea, because again it speaks to some optimism out there on the part of a city or county government to move ahead on some spending where there is a need? Could you give us a review of where those states may be on a timeline as to when they want to make a decision or at least some sense as to where they may be in thinking about moving ahead on that?
John S. Marr, Jr.: The quick answer is no. For years I think when Brian and I sat at hosting these calls, we kind of got specific opportunities out there and there was a lot of enthusiasm around Odyssey. It’s very difficult to know exactly when a state or a county’s going to make a decision and obviously we don’t want to start getting those specifics out there and having to respond to them when we don’t control those things. But as you indicated, we’re tracking a number of states that we think have decisions in their future. I would think some of them certainly would be in the coming year and certainly some of them would be further out. There are other large counties that will be making those decisions as well. We see a good volume of business as we go forward. As Brian indicated, we worked a little more backlog off because we’ve built up the delivery resources on the Odyssey side of the business and are obviously looking forward to replace that business with other deals. We see those deals. I’m not trying to avoid your question but I think it’s hard to predict exactly when they will occur. But given the volume I certainly expect some meaningful decisions in the coming year.
David Yuschak - Sanders Morris Harris: It certainly speaks to your customer base out there. At this point half a dozen look like from the pipeline but does not look like a lot of extraordinary caution if in fact there is a need to have that facility brought up to date so to speak.
John S. Marr, Jr.: That’s right.
David Yuschak - Sanders Morris Harris: On the ASPs you indicated I think Brian that you converted eight?
Brian K. Miller: Yes.
David Yuschak - Sanders Morris Harris: How many do you have now in total?
Brian K. Miller: The total ASP customers is 109.
David Yuschak - Sanders Morris Harris: That’s getting to be a very promising part of the long-term business model as well then?
John S. Marr, Jr.: Still relatively small in the overall company but it is fast growing both in terms of the number of customers and revenues albeit on a smaller base obviously. I think what you saw in the quarter was that more traction in the installed base than the new business market is good. We’ve certainly recognized that and will be certainly making the customer base aware of that and try to drive more of that. There isn’t the opportunity cost to licenses that you have with new clients so we’re pleased with the traction in the installed base and we’ll be pursuing that.
Operator: Our next question comes from [Dale Warmington - Dalwar Capital].
[Dale Warmington - Dalwar Capital]: Your tax rate. Could you explain why it’s so high?
Brian K. Miller: The tax rate is abnormally high this year because of the effect of the settlement we had last quarter with Bank of America regarding the dispute over the warrants. The way that was treated was that we issued warrants that had to run through the P&L and that’s a nondeductible expense that’s treated as an equity transaction or income taxes. So it’s a nondeductible non-cash expense that boosts our effective book tax rate. We’d be at about 38% excluding that one item.
[Dale Warmington - Dalwar Capital]: In terms of your revenue breakdown by geography, what percentage comes from say Canada, Puerto Rico and the UK?
John S. Marr, Jr.: It would be very small. It would be less than 5% of our revenues that would be from outside of the US and most of that would be Canada at this point.
Operator: Our next question comes from [Robert Moses - RGM Capital].
[Robert Moses - RGM Capital]: Two quick questions. One is really on just kind of framing the long-term revenue opportunity. I think John you’ve said in the past that a low to mid-double-digit growth is kind of where you’d hoped the company would be and I guess through nine months you’re definitely there this year. That would be kind of a market growth of 6% or 7%? Is that generally the long-term view?
John S. Marr, Jr.: Yes.
[Robert Moses - RGM Capital]: So if we go into next year, you’ll certainly do better than the market. The question is, is the market flat, is it up, kind of where it is. It doesn’t sound like you’re seeing a lot of indication that it’s anything other than normal but you’re just throwing up the caution flag just given everything that’s gone on at least the last couple months?
John S. Marr, Jr.: Yes. It’s more than a caution flag. We understand this market. A lot of us have been in it a long time and I have no question that somewhere tonight there’s a budget meeting and somebody’s going to challenge someone on the idea of buying a new system and whether it has to happen this coming year or could be held off for another period of time. I expect that whatever the market would have been, it’ll be something a little less than that now. I don’t know if that’ll be enough that we can get the kind of growth that we’ve said we expect to have over the long run. I think we’ll be able to certainly get our market share out of that, but as I said I think even if that one system is deferred a year, if you look over the next three or four or five years, I think you’re going to see the same volume of business you otherwise would have seen regardless of the current environment. But exactly how it affects the timing of some of these systems is a hard thing to know. Again the trajectory of our maintenance growth, subscription growth, our backlog, a lot of these things would suggest that we will have higher revenues this year than we have this year and we should be able to manage that. But whether they’re a little less growth than we’d see in most years will remain to be seen.
[Robert Moses - RGM Capital]: On the use of the balance sheet, the excess cash and the new credit facilities, certainly you have some things in the fourth quarter. I guess you’ve already bought back north of $20 million of stock and you’ve got the $10 million earmarked for [inaudible]. As we think about it though going forward with the cash you’re generating in the fourth quarter and beyond, just help me with how you think about buy-back versus acquisitions, because I know your stock’s come down a bit and it’s pretty intriguing yield, but how are you looking at other acquisitions? Are you seeing pricing coming down on those as well?
Brian K. Miller : We have thought that we have. We’ve seen some deals that our discipline was such that we weren’t interesting to them initially and they’ll come back around because there isn’t a market where they can just go get their price. So, we have seen some indications of that but, as you can see from the results, we actually haven’t closed an awful lot of acquisitions recently. We have seen indications, I do think there will be some attractive assets out there that will be more reasonable in terms of their valuation expectations and we hope to participate in that. But, we haven’t seen high volume real recently as you know.  There is no question that with our stock at the price it is at, if it were to remain in that range we feel good about our company and this asset and we will compare the valuation of Tyler to how we value other companies and when you buy your own company there aren’t integration issues, there aren’t new balance sheet items, there isn’t a level of uncertainty to so we feel very good about Tyler’s long term outlook. Obviously, if it’s more favorable than an acquisition that will weigh in to the decision process.  Analyst Generally John I know there’s a lot of different metrics that go in to it but kind of free cash flow if you look at your own business and I guess it’s like $1.25, $1.30 per share on a cash flow basis, free cash flow. Is that the major metric you’d look at for your own business in terms of buying back your own stock?
John S. Marr, Jr. : It is the way I think a lot of you guys are looking at us and certainly the way we look at it. It can be a little lumpy. I did say that our trailing 12 months free cash flow is $50 million. At the end of the year it will be something like $50 million as well and obviously that’s a pretty compelling valuation metric assuming it’s sustainable.  I mean we had a very strong third quarter for free cash flow. It isn’t accounting, it’s free cash flow so timing can work in to that a little bit more and whether that’s a new level we just build on or whether we got a little bit ahead of itself we’ll have to see. But, we definitely look at that but we will look at a more conservative outlook than what this quarter brought to us in terms of the year and the trailing 12 months as we make those decisions.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Brian Kinstlinger – Sidoti & Company, LLC.
Brian Kinstlinger – Sidoti & Company, LLC:  A couple follow ups but first of all John and Brian, you guys normally discuss the RFP kind of situation. Are we seeing as many as we were in the quarters past, are we seeing a little bit less? Give me a sense where that is trending.
John S. Marr, Jr. : We are seeing a little bit less. We were seeing a little bit less even before the last month or two so we’re tracking that very closely. So, the volume of RFPs is actually off a little bit and again, it was off a little bit before the current markets got to the point that they’re at so I’m not sure that’s at all reflective of the most recent market changes here in the last month or so. The average sales price, the average size of those is up a little bit so that offsets that a little bit and our competitive position or our market share has improved reasonably meaningfully so as a result you see that our license revenues was up and we continue to execute well within that. But, in terms of the absolute number of RFPs they are off a little bit.
Brian Kinstlinger – Sidoti & Company, LLC: In terms of appraisal services revenue, at what point is there one of these programs that will – when is the next big program that rolls off? Anything that’s meaningful high sort of $20 million of revenue?
John S. Marr, Jr. : Well, there are actually a number of states going in to cycles so we do see new business out there in the marketplace. We’re clearly the lead on the larger opportunities out there. There are a few companies in that marketplace these days and the ability to bond those and pursue those. There’s actually a number of states that are coming in to their cycle and we believe there’s a reasonable amount of business to come on line. We really think the level we’re at is pretty stable bottom for appraisal services. We do have a large engagement in New Orleans which is going well and contributing to their success. What is that Brian 18 months left in that or there abouts?
Brian K. Miller : It was about a two year project and it’s really kind of kicked in the last six months.
John S. Marr, Jr. : We don’t have a lot running off. In those markets the cycles are actually going to turn in our favor. We’re at kind of a lower end of our range as you know so we don’t feel our exposure to the downside in those revenues.
Brian Kinstlinger – Sidoti & Company, LLC: My last question is related to real estate, any that you purchased. First of all, how long is [Nike] committed to leasing that space? Then, Brian can you go over the amortization roughly quarterly towards that building versus the lease income that you’ll be getting?
John S. Marr, Jr. : I can answer the lease while Brian gets the D&A information. There are three floors in the building that we purchased and two of the floors become available to us in three years and the third floor could become available to us in five years although there is actually a renewal option for the tenant there. So that’s the way that breaks down. We currently have about 20,000 feet outside the primary building we [Fallis] that we’d be happy to relocate there tomorrow if it were available to us and just even conservative growth projections would mean that we would need the majority of those two floors by the time they become available. That was one of the things that was attractive to us is that we wouldn’t expect to have low utilization at any point in time on that particular property.
Brian K. Miller : The depreciation on that building should be on an annualized basis a little north of $300,000, about $318,000 a year. 
Brian Kinstlinger – Sidoti & Company, LLC: Is that $300,000 from [inaudible] and lease income you’re getting? Is that right?
John S. Marr, Jr. : Yes, that sounds about right.
Brian Kinstlinger – Sidoti & Company, LLC: So the way you basically computed it was that versus the interest income to make it slightly above breakeven on your last call?
John S. Marr, Jr. : Slightly better on an earnings basis and more meaningfully better on EBITDA and free cash flow basis.
Operator:  At this time there appear to be no more questions. Mr. Marr I’ll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.
John S. Marr, Jr. : We appreciate everybody’s time on the call today. I think it’s one of our longer calls which is understandable in the time. If there are any further questions, feel free to call Brian or myself. Have a great day.
Operator:  This does conclude today’s teleconference. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

John Marr: Thanks, Brian. The first quarter of 2008 marks Tyler’s 28th consecutive profitable quarter. Overall results for Q1 were in line with our expectations for revenues and margin growth. Organic growth continues to be in double-digits and was supplemented by recent acquisitions. We also saw solid growth in software services and maintenance. Free cash flow was $16.9 million, exceptionally strong. To be at this level there were contributions from throughout our business. But in particular it was driven by favorable billing terms on certain large contracts. We continue to invest in growth with increased research and development spending on our new Microsoft Dynamics Development effort as well as other new and existing product development efforts. Even after investing more than $24 million in cash in acquisitions in the repurchase of our own stock during the period, we ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet, including $46 million in cash and investments, providing Tyler a high degree of financial flexibility. The acquisitions of Versatran, Schoolmaster and ASP also closed since the first quarter of last year, resulted in 5.6% revenue growth, break-even GAAP earnings and positive EBITDA and free cash flow. Now I would like for Brian to offer some comments on the details of the financial statements. Brian.
Brian Miller: Thanks, John. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the quarter ended March 31st, 2008. For the first quarter of 2008 Tyler had revenues of $59.4 million, up 17.9% from the first quarter of 2007. Our organic revenue growth for the quarter was 12.3% and acquisitions since March 31st of 2007 accounted for 5.6% of our revenue increase. Operating income was $4.7 million, up 34.3% from $3.5 million for the first quarter of last year.  Net income for the quarter increased 30.2% to $3.1 million or 8 cents per diluted share compared to net income of $2.4 million or 6 cents per diluted share in the first quarter of 2007. Free cash flow was exceptionally strong in the first quarter. Cash flow from operations was $17.8 million for the first quarter compared to $6.9 million a year ago. Free cash flow was $16.9 million; nearly triple the $6.1 free cash flow for the first quarter of last year. The increase in free cash flow was primarily driven by an increase in deferred revenues resulting from cash received from advance payments ahead of revenue recognition on certain large contracts which have favorable billing terms. While we have revised our annual guidance for free cash flows modestly, the timing of cash flows can be difficult to predict, particularly from quarter to quarter. EBITDA for the first quarter of 2008 was $7.6 million compared to $6.1 million in the first quarter of 2007. A reconciliation of GAAP income to EBITDA is included in our earnings release.  Our software-related revenues, which includes software licenses, subscriptions, software services and maintenance increased in the aggregate 23.1% over the first quarter of 2007. Software license revenues increased 5.5% over last year`s first quarter. Software license revenue related to our financial management and education product, which comprised 71.1% of our software license revenues, increased 15% primarily due to revenue from student information and management solution and student transportation management solutions acquired in the last 12 months. Quartz and justice licenses increased 5% over last year`s first quarter. These increases were partially offset by a 32.4% decrease in appraisal and tax and other software licenses due in part to the deferral of software license revenue on a customer arrangement pending revised timelines for completion, as well as a small number of land records customers choosing our subscription-based options.  Subscription revenues increased 45.4%, primarily due to the addition of new, larger ASP customers in the last half of 2007 as well as an increase in disaster recovery customers.  During the first quarter we signed one new ASP customer, Westport Connecticut, for our financial management product and converted three existing MUNIS customers to our hosted offering. Software services were up 27.6% from last year`s first quarter and maintenance revenues grew 24.6% from the first quarter of 2007.  Appraisal services revenues for the first quarter decreased 17.9% from the first quarter of `07, primarily because we substantially completed projects associated with the Ohio revaluation cycle as well as other appraisal contracts. We currently expect appraisal revenues for the full year 2008 to decline moderately compared to 2007. The revenue mix for the first quarter of 2008 was as follows. Software licenses 14%, subscriptions 5%, software services 28%, maintenance 42%, appraisal services 8%, and hardware and other 3%.  For the first quarter of 2007 the revenue mix was licenses 16%, subscriptions 4%, software services 26%, maintenance 40%, appraisal services 11%, and hardware and other 3%. Overall 89% of our revenue mix was software-related in the first quarter of `08, up from 86% in the first quarter of 2007. For the first quarter of 2008, our overall gross margin improved 90 basis points to 36.7% compared to 35.8% in last year`s first quarter. Sequentially, gross margins decreased from 40.4% in the fourth quarter of `07. The increase in blended gross margin from last year`s first quarter was due to leverage and the utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale as well as a revenue mix with less appraisal services revenue.  The sequential decrease in the blended gross margin from the fourth quarter of 2007 is primarily due to lower software license revenues in the mix for the first quarter of 2008, which is a typical seasonal trend. Software license margins for the quarter were down slightly from last year at 68.5% versus 70.3% last year. The decrease is primarily due to the license product mix this year that included more third-party software which has lower margins than our proprietary software.  The blended margin for software services, maintenance and subscriptions increased to 31.8% from 29.9% for the same quarter last year and decreased sequentially from 35.1% in the fourth quarter of last year. The gross margin for appraisal services improved to 30.9% in the quarter from 28.4% in last year`s first quarter, primarily because of inclement weather in the first quarter of `07 which depressed productivity. SG&A expenses were 14.8 million for the first quarter of `08 compared to 13 million for the same period in `07. First quarter 2008 SG&A expenses improved to 24.9% of revenues compared to 25.8% in the same quarter last year. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenues grew at a slower rate than revenues due to cost management and leverage in the utilization of our administrative and sales staff. SG&A expenses for the first quarter of `08 included $647,000 of share-based compensation expense versus $455,000 in the first quarter of `07.  Research and development expense increased 48.5% to $1.8 million in the first quarter, reflecting the development efforts under our new alliance with Microsoft as well as other new product development projects. Research and development expenses increased over the prior year period because staffing for the Microsoft development effort ramped up throughout 2007. R&D expense in the current quarter was offset by $130,000 in reimbursement earned from Microsoft under the terms of our agreement.  Year over year backlog again grew faster than revenues, our backlog at March 31st, 2008 was $239 million, compared to $197.8 million at March 31st, 2007, an increase of 20.8% and down sequentially from $250.1 million at December 31st of 2007. Backlog related to our software business which excludes backlog from appraisal services contracts was $214.5 million at March 31st, an increase of 39.1 million or 22.3% from March 31st of last year and a decrease of 8.1 million or 3.6% from December 31st. Appraisal services backlog was 24.5 million at March 31st, 2008 compared to 22.4 million at March 31st, 2007 and 27.6 million at December 31st, 2007. During the first quarter we repurchased approximately 814,000 shares of our common stock on the open market at an average cost of approximately $12.92 per share. Our remaining authorization of shares that may be purchased currently totals 967,000 shares. Our CapEx during the first quarter was $891,000 with no capitalized software development. CapEx for the first quarter of last year was 766,000 and included 25,000 of capitalized software development costs.  Although we continue to spend significant amounts on product development, we currently expect that capitalized software development will remain at low levels for the foreseeable future and that virtually all of our development costs in 2008 will be expenses, either as R&D expense or in cost of software services and maintenance revenue. Amortization of post-acquisition software development costs was 1.1 million in the first quarter, down from 1.2 million in last year’s first quarter. Day sales outstanding and accounts receivable at March 31st ‘08 were 90 days, compared to 95 days at December 31st of ‘07 and 84 days at March 31st 2007. December is one of the peaks of our annual maintenance billing cycles and DSOs typically decline sequentially from Q4 to Q1 as we collect those receivables in the first quarter of each year. Our stockholders’ equity at March 31st 2008 was 132.8 million. We continue to have no debt outstanding and ended the first quarter of 2008 with 46.1 million in cash and investments. Included in our investments are approximately $5.8 million of auction rate 16:52 security that has been classified as non-current on our March31st balance sheet.  We significantly reduced our investments in auction rate securities from 41.6 million at December 31st and have not taken an impairment charge related to these securities. Our current level of investment in auction rate securities is relatively insignificant in relation to our total cash and investments and we do not anticipate that the current lack of liquidity of these investments will affect our operations. The first quarter results include the results of our two acquisitions in the quarter from their respective dates of acquisition. During the first quarter we completed the acquisition of all the capital stock of Versatran Solutions Inc. which develops and sells student transportation management software solutions for school districts and school transportation providers across North America, including solutions for school bus routing and planning, redistricting GPS fleet tracking, fleet maintenance and field trip planning.  We also purchased certain assets of Olympia Computing Company Inc. doing business as Schoolmaster which provides a full suite of student information systems. The combined purchase price excluding cash acquired and including transaction costs was approximately $13.9 million in cash and approximately 126,000 shares of Tyler common stock valued at $1.7 million. We have accounted for these acquisitions in the first quarter based on a preliminary allocation of the purchase prices which is subject to revision as the allocation is finalized. In connection with these acquisitions we reported $10.7 million of goodwill and $10.1 million of other intangible assets which are expected to be amortized over a weighted average period of approximately 10 years. We finished the quarter with 1784 employees, an increase of 157 over December 31st, of which 102 employees were added as a result of the first quarter acquisition. Now I’d like to turn the call back over to John for his comments.
John Marr: Thanks Brian. The first quarter is traditionally slow in our industry as well as at Tyler and in relation to our 2008 this year’s data consistent with that experience. However, this quarter demonstrated strong improvement in operating results from Q1 of last year with double-digit organic revenue growth, a 90 basis point increase in our gross margin in line with our expectations. SG&A as a percentage of revenue was down from prior year first quarter due to cost management and leverage and utilization of our administrative and sales staff and net income grew 30%.  With free cash flow of 16.9 million in the quarter we now have $41 million in free cash flow for the trailing 12 months. CapEx remains low although we continue to devote the same high-level of development resources to product enhancements in development and have increased our planned commitment to R&D for the remainder of 2008. Virtually all of these costs are now being expensed are included in our operating expense structure. Some of the contracts announced during the quarter were in our financial division Spring Branch in Humble, Texas, school districts for a combined value of 3.3 million, St. Louis County, Missouri with a contract value of 4.6 million and our Courts and Justice Division, Galveston County, Texas is a member county of the Conference for Urban Counties with a contract value of $2.7 million. In appraisal services we signed a contract with the state of Tennessee. Total contract value of 15.1 million. For IAS World Property Tax software and related services we signed a contract with Bedford County, Pennsylvania. Total contract value of 1.9 million for IAS World Property Assessment software and reappraisal services. For financial management and education during the quarter we signed 24 different contracts with customers in 16 different states. We continue to have very strong backlog even as we increase our capacity for delivery. Total backlog increased from March of 2007 at a faster rate than revenues. License growth was only 6% and mostly from acquisitions. But license growth is not linear and we do not expect – and we do expect healthy growth in licenses as the year progresses. Overall we expect licenses for the year to grow at a rate equal to or greater than the overall growth rate for the company. And as a result margins will expand as the year goes on. By design we are seeing solid growth and recurring revenue maintenance with growth well in excess of our overall growth rate for the company. As you have seen as a percentage of revenue, maintenance has grown from 40 to 42% year-over-year. This combined with 5% subscription based revenue brings our recurring revenues to 47% of total. And that is only for the contracted portion. Considerably more revenue is derived from these customers for other services and products. As we evaluate our market we are very aware of the broad economic weakness and in particular the pressure on real estate values and the decline of real estate related fees to local communities. While there are some anecdotal signs of these issues effecting decisions in our space there really has been no fundamental change that we can see. Our activity by all measures is relatively normal. However, given the extent of these issues we will continue to monitor very closely.  Certainly we have seen these cycles before and we are fortunate to be in a market well insulated from cyclical pressures. I’m confident that we can make progress financially as a business as well as competitively and emerge from the cycle in a better position. Our guidance to 2008 remains largely unchanged with the exception of modest changes to free cash flow in our share account. We expect diluted earnings per share of 49 to 53 cents. For the year estimated pretax expenses of – related to stock options and employee stock purchase plan is expected to be $2.9 million or approximately 6 cents per share after taxes. We estimate an effective tax rate of approximately 33% for 2008. We’ve modestly revised free cash flow for the year to 36 to 42 million with total CapEx approximately of 4.5 to 5.5 million for the year in total depreciation and amortization of approximately 12 million. We have a modest revision in our share account based on our repurchases in the first quarter and now expect fully diluted shares to be 39.5 to 40 million. Now Jason will take questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Fred Buonocore with CJS Securities.
Fred Buonocore – CJS Securities: Hi gentlemen. I’m just calling in on behalf of Charlie Strauzer. How are you today?
John Marr: Doing well.
Fred Buonocore – CJS Securities:  Great. So you’re SG&A declined as a percentage of sales but it had a fairly significant dollar increase. Can you talk about the actual dollar increase there I’d assume largely related to acquisitions. But can you dissect that a little bit for us?
Brian Miller: Sure. Of the SG&A increase a fair amount of it did come from acquisitions. The acquisition impact is at about $1.6 million of SG&A expense. And we also have modestly higher SG&A expense related to stock compensation. That would be the other major impact there.
Fred Buonocore – CJS Securities: Got it. And then on gross margins in this seasonally weak quarter, would you say that this – that your performance actually exceeded what you’d expected? And can you kind of just talk a little bit more about the 90 basis point year-over-year improvement that you touched on in your prepared remarks?
Brian Miller: Well the improvement that I think we mentioned in the remarks is pretty much in line with our expectations for the quarter. So generally not a big surprise there. We’ve expected modest improvement in the first quarter and as John mentioned as revenues – particularly license revenues grow through the year, we expect to see margins continue to improve throughout the year.
Fred Buonocore – CJS Securities: Excellent, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll now go to Kirk Materne with Banc of America Securities.
Kirk Materne – Banc of America Securities: Yes, thanks very much. Brian, I guess R&D obviously ramped up year-over-year as you guys brought on guys to work on the Microsoft dynamics project. Do you still have further people to bring on or is that going to grow sort of in line with revenues or is that going to be growing at a slower rate I guess in terms of absolute dollars?
Brian Miller:  I think in terms of staffing we’re generally staffed at – in the range of the level we expect to be throughout 2008. There could be modest changes in it but we’re generally ramped up to the point where we’d be throughout the year. The bigger impact on the net R&D expenses as we’ve talked about last quarter, last couple of quarters we are receiving some reimbursement from Microsoft for part of the development expenses to the extent that they arrange with us to use some of the features that we’re developing in their broader commercial product. This quarter that reimbursement, it was recognized as only 130,000. It was a fair amount more than that in the last two quarters and could vary from quarter to quarter. We expect to continue to see reimbursement throughout the year but at this point we do not know exactly what that will be for the balance of the year. So that also caused the net R&D expense to be a little higher this quarter because of the lower reimbursement.
Kirk Materne – Banc of America Securities:  Okay, thanks. That’s helpful. And then John, I know you guys have been through a number of cycles like this, down cycles in the market. Could you just talk a little bit about just sort of the deal closure process? Is it different really in the state and local governments than it would be on sort of the commercial side? Meaning if commercial side everybody’s pipeline looks great until you try to close the deal and there’s another set of approvals that comes in and things might go through but they get delayed. Do you see those type of delays in the state and local government? Maybe not now but is that a risk and I guess just how should we view that? Because that always seems to be the bigger issue with software. If it’s not the pipeline does not look good things start getting pushed out on a quarter by quarter basis.
John Marr:  Yes, well we’re certainly watching it real closely. I’m only aware of a couple of deals in the last quarter or so that got late in the decision process that did not get finished. And certainly we can look at those and be alarmed if we want them. But the reality is that’s pretty consistent with any tops. So we’re not seeing anything that’s different. And certainly we’re getting asked that question a lot but the pipeline, the demo schedules, the RFT activity as well as decisions are all pretty normal and we are watching very closely to see if some of these deals get dropped as they go through the process. But we have not been seeing that and have not really seen any signs of it. It certainly is not a real robust market so when I mention the past, in my view it’s an opportunity. And we should be able to both perform financially during the period as well as improve our competitive position and some people with some lighter market share may find the market less attractive so we’ll see.
Kirk Materne – Banc of America Securities: Okay. Great. Thanks very much.
Operator: We’ll go now to David Yuschak with SMH Capital.
David Yuschak – SMH Capital: Great quarter guys, great start to the year. But one question I’ve got for you guys, your backlog growth has really been as you said earlier, John, been above your revenue gains. And probably from my point of view that backlog growth has been above where I thought your – even your long-term growth could be on revenue relative to the industry. I’m just wondering if you can help us out. Where are you seeing surprises to business being brought in? Because I know you’ve been working on getting that geographic expansion. Is there any surprises that you’re seeing where the penetration is coming maybe sooner or is this in product categories like maybe the schools because some of your recent acquisitions is gaining some traction and some of your additional customers are doing business with elsewhere? Can you guys kind of lay the land as to how that is developing so that you’re turning in at kind of a good bookings rate?
John Marr: Yes, well it’s really across the board, David. In the financial area which is the biggest part of our business, contracts tend to be going into backlog and staying there a little bit longer just based on the terms of the agreements and the accounting around them. The business is in general the same but again I think contracts are – spend a little more time in backlog so it takes a little more time to run them through the financial statement. So that’s contributing something. And then the larger contracts that we’re seeing in tax and appraisal and in courts and justice, they go into backlog as you know and those are generally multi-year agreements that are earned over a long period of time. Obviously we have the Tennessee contract that’s gone in there recently. So it’s really across the board. There’d be large contracts that stay in there for some time. The larger tax and appraisal contracts, the courts and justice contracts and then again contracts in the past that maybe some of the more routine financial deals very quickly move from contracts through the financial statement. Some of them are larger, they’re more complex and based on the accounting requirements as well as the terms of the agreements, they’re spending a little more time in backlog.
David Yuschak – SMH Capital: But are you seeing any positives out of your geographic expansion that you may not have –
John Marr: No question. I mean, we’ve made a lot of progress geographically. We’ve said that for a number of years now. I think most of our product sets we now continue to be national products with either a primary or secondary presence in all the markets across the country. So that’s really where we’ve had the most success over the last three or four years really. And again have our sales force spread out throughout the country; have a much larger presence in a number of these different marketplaces. But I think more recently in the last year it would be starting to have more success in the larger contracts. Again, you look at the Tennessee contract, the number of large courts and justice contracts and we do not do a lot of $10 million financial contracts but there certainly are a lot more $2, $3, $4 million contracts in that space as well.
David Yuschak – SMH Capital: And then finally on this sales initiative, as you get closer to when Microsoft products begin to roll out, do you see anything changing in the way you maybe accelerate your field sales effort to bring in additional sales to capitalize on that particular initiative as well?
John Marr: Well I think it’ll be maybe a redeployment in our direct effort and maybe growth somewhat about the way we’ve grown that channel historically. I’d expect some increase in capacity there. But really just maybe a change in the way we’re proposing different applications in the direct space. We will have probably kind of a secondary small channel but a number of resources we currently do not have that will exist to support the Microsoft business partners and their channel. So I expect that on a direct basis this will be a good supplement and allow us to achieve higher growth rates on direct basis which is really our current business. And it’ll be entirely new business, what we’ll see throughout the indirect channel or through the Microsoft business partners that sell into other markets. And we’ll need more of a marketing sales support group that has not existed historically. We do have some people that are kind of transitioning over to that now where we’re going to different shows and conferences and meeting these partners in anticipation of that. But it’s really a slice of certain people’s responsibility now and eventually it’ll be full-time responsibility for maybe a handful of people to start with.
David Yuschak – SMH Capital:  If I understand you, does that mean that there would be more like technical sales people for that channel? Is that kind of what you’re thinking of?
John Marr: It would be a combination of product specialists or technical people. But certainly sales and marketing people that support the process help educate partners around the world really on what the story is and how to position it and support those channels. We have those people internally that certainly provide the different business points and guidance through our sales channel on ASP solutions, on positioning different products. And we’ll want to do that to enhance the indirect channel at Microsoft as well.
David Yuschak – SMH Capital:  Great, thanks a lot.
Operator:
 :
Brian Kinstlinger – Sidoti & Company: Hi guys.
John Marr: Hey Brian.
Brian Kinstlinger – Sidoti & Company: First question of my two is not new information. If I look at the K, your software license in justice was up 26% last year and MUNIS was down eight in education. And then appraisal was down 21%. I’m curious in the first quarter if we’re looking at similar trends; obviously criminal justice like you’ve talked about is your biggest growth riburn [ph]. If those numbers you expect to change drastically this year, especially on the MUNIS side and what are the trends driving it if you will?
John Marr: I do not think we’ll see a drastic change. I think MUNIS for the year last year was pretty strong. And we’re looking for modest growth in the MUNIS licenses for this particular year. Courts and justice we would look for more significant growth. They really had some timing issues in the first quarter and we would look for them to have higher license revenues for the next two quarters.
Brian Kinstlinger – Sidoti & Company:  Okay, in follow up on the software license, when you look at your pipeline backlog or whatever you’re looking at for the remainder of the year how do you get a sense of the combination of third party related software that you’re going to deliver versus proprietary? And what’s your sense going forward based on what you see if there is visibility at all to that?
Brian Miller: Well some of that mix can bounce around quite a bit from quarter to quarter. The timing at some of the third party renewals and the mix in a particular contract of how much is third party license versus our proprietary license does bounce around a bit. But it stays generally in the 10 to 15% of the total license revenues are third party and generally 85 to 90% are proprietary licenses. And we expect to be in that range over the course of the full year. But as it bounces around from quarter to quarter based on specific contracts it can have a modest effect on our overall gross margin because the margins on the third party tends to be under 20% and the license on our – or the margin on our proprietary licenses tends to be north of 80%.
Brian Kinstlinger – Sidoti & Company: So it’s choppy is what you’re saying?
Brian Miller: Yes, a little choppy. Yes.
Brian Kinstlinger – Sidoti & Company: My last question if I might, because I do not think I’m the last person in the queue, is you grew 5% in this quarter and 11 last and obviously we know before that was a little tougher and I’m just curious based on talking about no drastic change in the trends from last year how your guidance – what it implies for software revenue. Is it an acceleration from where at 5% or is it you’re thinking the 5% range with services growing much faster?
Brian Miller: It’s definitely acceleration. I think John mentioned in his comments that we expect that for the full year that license growth would be in line with or slightly above our overall revenue growth. And we’ve given that top-line growth including acquisitions as being in the kind of upper teens to 20% range. So clearly we expect an acceleration in the second – or in the last three quarters of the year. Part of that comes from some of the things that John mentioned in terms of some of the timing, some of the contracts that – particularly in courts and justice and tax that have acceleration in the percentage of completion recognition as we move through the year or as we achieve certain milestones that allow us to recognize more revenues on those. And then in the areas where we recognize revenues more on delivery of the software and primarily in financial we would also expect as we typically have in prior years to see sequential increases throughout the year and the license revenues on those.
Brian Kinstlinger – Sidoti & Company:  But you do not year over – just so I understand – year over year you’re expecting mid to high teens which is based on your overall revenue. But that’s what you’re expecting on the software license line specifically?
John Marr: That’s right.
Brian Kinstlinger – Sidoti & Company:  Wow, okay. Great. Thanks.
Operator: And at this time there appears to be no more questions. Mr. Marr I’ll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.
John Marr: Okay, well thank you Jason. We appreciate all of you joining us on the call today. If there are any further questions feel free to contact Brian or myself. Thanks again. Have a good day.
Operator: This does conclude today’s teleconference; you may now disconnect and have a nice day.

Operator:  Hello and welcome to Tyler Technologies fourth quarter 2007 conference call. Your host for today's call is John Marr, President and CEO, of Tyler Technologies. Mr. Marr, please begin your call. 
John Marr: Welcome to our fourth quarter 2007 earnings call. With me on the call today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First I'd like for Brian to give the Safe Harbor Statement. Then I'll have some preliminary comments and Brian will review the details of our operating results. Then I'll have some final comments and we'll take your questions. Brian?
Brian Miller: Thank you, John. During the course of this conference call management may make statements that provide information other than historical information and may include projections concerning the company's future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor Provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. John?
John Marr: During the fourth quarter Tyler continued its trend of improving results. By most measures the fourth quarter represented new highs including total revenues, license revenues, operating income and backlog. These strong results in the quarter allowed us to achieve our financial objectives for the year. For the quarter we posted 18% revenue growth and 50% growth in earnings per share. Our full year 2007 results were in line with our expectations. We were especially pleased with our 2007 free cash flow of over $30 million, which grew by almost 35% over the last year and exceeds GAAP net income by 73%. We ended the year with a strong cash position of approximately $56 million after investing over $23 million in acquisitions and company stock repurchases. And despite an uncertain economy and softness in the real estate market we continue to see a stable and normal marketplace where our strong and constantly improving products improve our competitive position. Now I’d like for Brian to provide more details on the operating results.
Brian Miller: Thanks John. Yesterday Tyler Technologies reported its results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2007. We ended 2007 with a very strong fourth quarter establishing new highs in many of our key financial metrics. For the fourth quarter of 2007 Tyler had revenues of $60.4 million, up 18.1% from the fourth quarter of 2006. Operating income was $9.6 million, an increase of $3.3 million or 53.2% from the fourth quarter of 2006 operating income of $6.3 million. Net income for the quarter was $6.2 million or $0.15 per diluted share compared to net income of $4.2 million or $0.10 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2006. Fully diluted shares for the fourth quarter were $40.4 million and for the year were $41.4 million. We excluded the effect of the Banc of America warrants from the potentially dilutive common shares as of September 10, 2007. Results for the fourth quarter of 2007 included a total of $660,000 of non-cash expenses associated with our share-based compensation plan of which $69,000 is included in the cost of revenues and $591,000 is included in SG&A expense. Cash flow from operations was $9.6 million for the fourth quarter compared to $4.1 million a year ago. Free cash flow was $8.5 million up 158% compared to free cash flow of $3.3 million for the fourth quarter of last year. For the year ended December 31, 2007, free cash flow was $30.3 million compared to $22.5 million for the same period in 2006, an increase of 34.6%. Total depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter was $3.4 million and for the year was $11.2 million. EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2007 increased 47.2% to $13 million from EBITDA of $8.8 million in the fourth quarter of ’06. A reconciliation of GAAP income to EBITDA is included in our fourth quarter earning press release. Our software-related revenues, which include software licenses, subscriptions, software services and maintenance increased in the aggregate 20.4% over the fourth quarter of 2006. Software license revenues increased 11.2% over last year's fourth quarter driven in large part by growth in our financials, imports and justice products. Subscription-based revenue, which primarily consists of revenues derived from ASP services and other hosted software as service offerings, software subscriptions and disaster recovery services increased 48.2%. Software services were up 24.3% from last year's fourth quarter as we benefited from the approximately 90 additional implementation and training staff we added during 2007. Maintenance revenues grew 19.2%. Appraisal services revenues for the fourth quarter decreased 4.5% from the fourth quarter of 2006 to $4.8 million. The decrease in appraisal services revenues is due to substantially completing business associated with Ohio's revaluation cycle. The level of appraisal revenues in 2008 will ultimately depend on our ability to replace the Ohio appraisal services business. The revenue mix for the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to the fourth quarter of 2006 was as follows: software licenses 18% versus 19% last year, subscriptions 5% versus 4% last year, software services 27% versus 25% last year, maintenance 38% versus 37% last year, appraisal services 8% versus 10% last year and hardware and other 4% versus 5% last year. Overall, 87% of our revenue mix was software-related for the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to 86% in the fourth quarter of last year. For the fourth quarter of 2007 our overall gross margin was 40.4%, up 80 basis points compared to 39.6% in last year’s fourth quarter. Our gross margin improvement was driven primarily by improved software services, maintenance and subscription gross margins due to leverage in the utilization of our support and maintenance staff as well as revenue growth outpacing staffing cost of our maintenance, ASP and the disaster recovery services. Sequentially gross margins increased 100 basis points from 39.4% in the third quarter of 2007 as we continued to see improved utilization of the implementation staff we hired earlier in the year. Software license margin for the quarter was 70.2% versus 71.3% last year. The decrease in software license gross margin is primarily driven by the one-time acceleration of amortization of certain previously acquired software. The blended margin for software services, maintenance and subscriptions was 35.1% compared to 32.7% for the same quarter last year and increased from 33.9% in the third quarter of this year, again primarily due to improved staff utilization and leverage in maintenance subscription revenues. The gross margin for appraisal services was 34.9% compared to 34.0% in last year's fourth quarter. SG&A expenses were $13.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2007 and $12.8 million for the same period in 2006. Fourth quarter 2007 SG&A expenses were 22% of revenues compared to 25% for the same period in ’06. SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter of 2007 were the lowest level as a percentage of revenue since we have been in the software business due to cost controls and leverage of our infrastructure. SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter of 2007 included $591,000 of share-based compensation expense versus $417,000 in the fourth quarter of 2006. Research and development expenses of $1.2 million increased 42% in the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of last year and increased 84% from the third quarter of 2007. In September of 2007 we amended our software development agreement with Microsoft in which Microsoft has agreed to assist in funding our Microsoft Dynamic AX development costs in exchange for intellectual property rights for use outside of the public sector. The increase in R&D expenses compared to the third quarter of this year is due to lower R&D reimbursements in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter, and an expense incurred in the fourth quarter for third-party consulting services. We currently expect that virtually all of our new product development costs in 2008 will be expensed rather than capitalized. Our effective income tax rate was 38.9% for the fourth quarter versus 38% for the same quarter in 2006. Our backlog at the end of the calendar year was $250.1 million compared to $205.9 million at December 31, 2006 and $225.8 at September 30, 2007. Backlog related to our software business, which excludes backlog from appraisal services contracts was $222.5 million at December 31st, an increase of $24.4 million or 12.3% from the third quarter of this year and an increase of $39.3 million or 21.4% from December of last year. New contract signings for our Odyssey court systems and our tax and appraisal software products were primarily responsible for the growth in backlog. Appraisal services backlog was $27.6 million at December 31, 2007. During the fourth quarter we repurchased 360,600 shares of common stock on the open market an average cost of $13.94 per share.For the full year of 2007 we repurchased a total of approximately of 1.3 million shares of our stock at an average cost of $12.93 per share. In January of this year we purchased an additional 814,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $12.92. Our remaining authorization of shares that may be repurchased as of today is 967,000 shares. Our capital expenditures during the fourth quarter were $1.1 million primarily related to internal use, computer hardware and IT software systems and included $9,000 of capitalized software development. CapEx for the fourth quarter of last year was $833,000 and included $33,000 of capitalized software development costs. Although during 2007 we continued to invest heavily in product development, the vast majority of our development cost in 2007 were expensed as either R&D or cost of maintenance revenues. Amortization of post acquisition software development costs was $1.1 million in the fourth quarter. Day sales outstanding and accounts receivable at 12-31-07 was 95 days, an improvement compared to 102 days at December 31, 2006. The increase in DSOs from 93 days at September 30, 2007 is due to normal seasonality with relatively large annual maintenance billings at the end of December. Our stockholders equity at December 31, 2007 was $137.2 million. We continued to have no debt outstanding and ended the fourth quarter of 2007 with $55.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. We ended the quarter with 1,627 employees a decrease of 13 compared to September 30, and up a 114 from the beginning of the year. The increase in headcount from approximately 1,500 at the beginning of the year includes 83 personnel from our acquisitions of ADF and EDP during 2007. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to John for his additional comments.
John Marr: Thanks, Brian. We are pleased with the quarter and another year of progress very much inline with our long-term plans. Along with the successful year financially we made significant progress across our product lines as well as expanding our sales and service channels to deliver our new levels of business. For the year earnings grew 22%, free cash flow exceeded our expectations in the fourth quarter and should continue to be well above GAAP earnings in 2008 due to higher depreciation and amortization including new amortization from acquisitions, low CapEx, growing deferred revenue mainly from growth in our maintenance base but also from slower revenue recognition on some contracts due to terms and accounting requirements as well as non-cash stock compensation expense. We achieved results while making substantial investments in new product development and continuing to invest in our existing product line, as well as building additional capacity in both our sales and service channels. We remain encouraged by the opportunity our partnership with Microsoft can represent and as a result have invested at a higher level than planned at the beginning of 2007. During the year and even during the current quarter we have continued to invest heavily in the school area through product development as well as with our acquisitions of Schoolmaster and VersaTrans. Schoolmaster has a strong presence and customer base in the student administration area and expands our presence in the West. And VersaTrans brings a new and completely complimentary product set to our school offering servicing the transportation area. During 2007 we experienced strong growth from subscription-based services, which have less up front revenue but have high margins and high visibility. Our current estimated 2008 annual run rate for subscription based revenues is approximately $13.6 million. Backlog continues to grow ahead of revenues and ended the year at another record high level of more than 20% higher than the beginning of 2007. Our guidance for 2008 remains as previously announced with revenues of $259 million to $265 million. Diluted earnings per share of $0.49 to $0.53 with fully diluted shares of approximately of 40.5 million shares. For the year estimated pre-tax expenses related to stock options and employee stock purchase plan is expected to be $2.9 million or approximately $0.06 after taxes. We estimate an effective tax rate of approximately 38.1% for 2008. Free cash flow is expected to be between $34 million and $41 million with total CapEx of approximately of $4.5 million to $5.5 million for the year and total depreciation and amortization of $13 million to $14 million. Our guidance for 2008 includes the projected results of the two acquisitions Schoolmaster and VersaTrans. Based on very preliminary estimates of the purchase accounting adjustments we believe that these acquisitions together will be slightly dilutive to earnings but will be accretive to EBITDA and cash flow. We will now take your questions.
Operator: Our first question comes from Brian Kinstlinger from Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead with your question. 
Brian Kinstlinger - Sidoti & Company: Hi, guys how are you?
Brian Miller: Good Brian. How are you?
Brian Kinstlinger - Sidoti & Company: The first question I had is a maintenance question. Brian you mentioned a one-time amortization from acquisition. Would that be $1 million I see from acquired software? Is that what that is?
Brian Miller: That’s part of that. We had -- we accelerated the amortization of some of our accelerated software -- some of our acquired software that added about $600,000 of amortization in the current quarter that was basically a one-time acceleration.
Brian Kinstlinger - Sidoti & Company: Where do I see that, like so where I know where it might come out next quarter and be a little bit lower? Where on the-- which line item is that?
Brian Miller: On the income statement that's in amortization of acquired software.
Brian Kinstlinger - Sidoti & Company: And just a big picture question, maybe, John, you can give us a sense and I think it's courts but maybe even some better detail on the courts growth versus financial growth which one's stronger, maybe some numbers around it? And then give us a sense of when you think is -- you guys have talked a lot about the education space. When do you think that can become a meaningful number to your business my guess is right now, it’s relatively small? Thank you.
John Marr: Okay. Well, certainly as a percentage courts is our fastest growing division as we've expected for some time. We've got a significant backlog on the Odyssey product. We've continually been investing and building out the channel to deliver on that and we're doing that well, the implementations are going well. The customers are happy and referencable and so that's going well. Their growth is the highest within the company in terms of percentage. On Odyssey itself it's maybe double the company growth rate or approaching that, whereas financials is growing pretty much in line with the overall company growth rate. I'd have to do the math but on an absolute dollar basis which one is contributing more, but that's a general overview of that.  On the school side you know, the acquisitions of ADP, EDP and Schoolmaster and VersaTrans all bring, I mean, these are all real companies with real customers, heavily weighted on maintenance and install base. So, that’s starting to be a meaningful part of our business just really thinking right now because we include that in our financials division, I don’t look at those in the results but I would say that in the 8% to 10% of our revenues going into the year if you add those up and then you want to remember again they are in the financial division. But probably it's about half of the large government financials revenue what comes from schools. So overall it's probably more on the 40% range. So, depending on how you want to look at that we're doing a significant amount of business in schools. We have been for some time on the financial side and the acquisition of these administrative systems and the acquisition of the product we acquired two years ago and our further investment in that is to build out the complimentary applications like scheduling, grading, attendance, now transportation with VersaTrans, the way we have an offering on the city and county side such as courts and justice and tax and appraisal and utilities. So it's really following the same strategy.
Brian Kinstlinger - Sidoti & Company: Great thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Yuschak from SMH Capital. Please go ahead with your question.
David Yuschak – SMH Capital: I could hear you guys but you couldn't hear me.
John Marr: Okay, David.
David Yuschak – SMH Capital: Hey, just real quick on your EBIT margins, your best EBIT margins you've had in corporate history the last two quarters and I think it beats the other -- your best quarter probably was maybe three or four years earlier and that may have been on your Minnesota software but I don't remember. Are we beginning to see the kind of scale across your product line that's giving you the ability to get these margins to where they're at right now and -- because you've always argued you can get these numbers a lot higher. So, I'm just wondering if it's just breadth here right now of what you're seeing or is it the ones that have been underperforming are beginning to get to scale to get you that boost?
John Marr: Well, we had a strong quarter in licenses and across the board and so obviously there's a lot of leverage in those incremental revenues within a particular quarter. And I would say that we do expect 2008 to be as 2007 was, a year that builds as we go along. So, it will unfortunately drop back from obviously the Q4 levels in the first quarter and grow throughout the year. So we're going to see more of that and as a result, obviously you'll see the margins contract a bit early in the year, David. I think that leverage is clearly there. I tried to emphasize on the guidance call a month ago that I think we have the ability in the next year or two to realize reasonably higher margins but we tried to point out that we really are making a conscious decision -- while we all want to have better earnings we are making a conscious decision to invest very significantly in the company and its products and some of these acquisitions, we believe, we are doing well establishing a leadership position in this space. The way projects are run these days and the way they're accounted for, most of that investment runs through the P&L. So that will keep some pressure on margins, but it's a conscious decision and in our view a good investment in the future.
David Yuschak – SMH Capital: As far as just R&D and as far as supporting that Microsoft product, is there any -- you probably feel comfortable now about what you need to do in that incremental spend to get that down the road, but is there anything in that expectation that could help -- could lead maybe even boosting that investment in that product category even more than what you've now anticipate boosting it to?
John Marr: That's possible. We have a current staffing plan that's built into the numbers we've put out in 2008, but it certainly is possible, everything we've seen so far has been reassuring in terms of the opportunity and to the extent that we can put more on this product and make it have that much more value to our clients and be that much more competitive in the marketplace, it's going to be the right thing to do. So, it certainly is possible. We are already at a level above where we thought we'd be at this point in terms of resources, but I think it's more likely to grow than to fall backward and that's based on the significance of the opportunity and as we make those adjustments, we'll share it with you.
David Yuschak – SMH Capital: Now does that mean it's just more robust that you're going to bring to the market compared to the past rather than maybe bringing a timeline into it?
John Marr: Yes. I would not want to encourage anyone to expect a release to be earlier. We've talked about late '09 or more than likely into 2010 before we see revenues from this. And I think it is definitely more about including more functionality in the system, addressing more markets in terms of sizes and internationally, et cetera. And again, just more functionality, more addressable marketplace, but it should not affect the timeline.
David Yuschak – SMH Capital: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dale Warmington from Dale Capital. Please go ahead with your question. 
Dale Warmington – Dale Capital: Yes, quick question as it relates to your SG&A. There was a 200 basis point increase from 25% down to 22%. Can we expect this trend to continue into the fourth and could you elaborate some more as to how you were are able to achieve this magnitude in terms of reduction of SG&A?
Brian Miller: Well, within the SG&A there's a fair amount of leverage. As a small public company, there are significant costs that are relatively fixed and as we grow the revenue side, those don't have to increase particularly on a lot of the administrative functions. We've had a lot of emphasis on controlling those SG&A costs and leveraging the existing infrastructure as we grow. So, it's certainly in quarters where you see significant revenue growth like you see in this quarter that's intensified. We would expect over time to continue to see SG&A come down as a percentage of revenues 300 basis points in a year is fairly dramatic. But, I don't think you'd expect to see that same level of reduction on into '08, but we would expect to continue to see marginal improvement of SG&A as a percentage of revenues.
Dale Warmington – Dale Capital: And one last question, in terms of visibility, as toward the end of the quarter what type of revenue visibility do you have? I mean you have a backlog of $250 million, all right. What portion do you anticipate recognizing within the quarter?
Brian Miller: Well, the backlog going into the quarter, we have -- it varies from quarter-to-quarter. We have a significant portion of the backlog particularly in certain areas like courts and justice and tax and appraisal where we tend to have longer term implementation as well as basically all of the maintenance which is close to 40% of our business as well as the subscription business which is 5% of our business, so all of those by definition are coming out of backlog.
John Marr: I think it's really down in the -- we're down from much higher levels the ways things have evolved, I’m going to say 5%, 6%, 7% of revenues in any given quarter don’t come out of backlog and so that’s starting to be a much smaller number then it was historically as we have more and more contracts again as we said based on terms and accounting going to backlog and then we recognized over a period of time and maintenance and recurring services like ASP becoming more significant parts of our business. So, that’s a good thing and it definitely improves our visibility. At the same time I would say you know, 5% or 6% is material obviously to our earnings, so we will still see some fluctuation and then have some lack of visibility on the last couple of [inaudible] that we are looking at in each quarter but it has definitely become a less significant amount of the revenue in the current quarter.
Brian Miller: And on a broader basis of the $250 million backlog that we go into the year with, about two-thirds of that is expected to be recognized in 2008 and the balance is out in future years.
Dale Warmington – Dale Capital: Thanks a million.
Operator: Our next question comes from Charlie Strauzer from CJS Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Charlie Strauzer – CJS Securities: Hello Brian.
Brian Miller: How are you Charles.
Charlie Strauzer – CJS Securities: Hey, a couple quick questions, John, just a little bit more high level stuff. If it you look at the subscription software growth, it's been really kind of kicking in a little bit here and it's been a nice kind of success story and is it really just a byproduct of you're focusing the sales force more on offering that or your customers are saying to you hey, you know what we've got an aging work force, this is definitely a better model for us. It's harder for us to find the personnel to kind of replace these people who are retiring or who are moving on to the private sector. Give us a sense of what's driving the growth there?
John Marr: Yes, it would be the latter. Since we introduced this, I don't know six years ago now, we have never had any bias in the way we price it to the customer or on the way we incent or direct the sales channel. We've felt that we want to capture the market share we can capture and that it's up to the client as to what the best way to take delivery of the product or the service is. So, we continue to have that. We like the recurring business, but generally we're trying to not direct it and again would hate to lose a client or some market share because we were directing it one way or the other. So, it is more the clients having appeal for it. And I know like a large deal this past year was the Fort Worth school district and that was originally bid as a traditional deployment and even during the process they saw our changes in their staff and IT infrastructure and said hey, let's take a look at this the other way and concluded it made sense to them. So, it's the marketplace responding to it more than us directing it.
Charlie Strauzer – CJS Securities: That's one of the things I think that you've talked about for a long time is that as the kind of the baby boom generation moves more towards retirement it's going to be harder for these government agencies to find qualified personnel. So, it might make more sense with that going forward?
John Marr: That's right. It generally is a reaction to their own situation more than what we're directing whether it is turnover in the IT area, whether it's aging equipment and infrastructure that would have to be replaced, but something that enables them to take a look at it objectively and say maybe it makes sense to get this as a service.
Charlie Strauzer – CJS Securities: Got it. And then shifting gears for a second to the school and education related segment that you're moving into, if you can give us a better sense of the kind of competitive landscape there, it seems like it's a more competitive environment than some other public companies that focus on educational software as well. How do you differentiate, is it more because you're more in the public school arena versus they're in maybe universities? Are there -- is it more fragmented than before than, than other areas that you're in? Give us a sense of that if you can?
John Marr: Well you kind of have two major areas in schools. You've got the financial side, which is an extension of our other financial products. So, our investment's largely made there and obviously it's an opportunity to leverage that investment into a related market. And there I think it is -- the financial system especially if you include human resources, which is pretty -- has a lot of unique functionality for schools versus public sector in general or even more broadly the commercial world and as you know we compete with products, especially on our high end that are sold to the commercial world as well. And its one thing to go to the public sector, but it's even more significant to go into schools where you have substitute pay and you have many different types of bargaining units and just an awful lot of different things. So, the specialization is even a little more extreme and I think we have some differentiation there that allows us to protect our pricing and we don't have different pricing for schools than we do for cities and counties. So, we don't -- we haven't seen any unusual pressure there. On the administrative side which is where we've been doing the acquisitions and investing in new products, that's entirely different obviously than there are no horizontal applications that would play there. It's very much a unique vertical market that products have to be built specifically for and that would be a case of what you referred to in fragmentation. It's a market where there are some people consolidating a bit. We're one of them and bringing customer groups and products together and trying to build a national presence in something that has what we've achieved on the financial side.
Charlie Strauzer – CJS Securities: Excellent. Great. That sounds great. And then finally one housekeeping question. I might have missed this if you said it earlier, but what would the-- what was the option expense number for the quarter, the SFAS expense?
Brian Miller: The total for the quarter was $660,000 and $591,000 was in SG&A, $69,000 in cost of revenues.
Charlie Strauzer – CJS Securities: Great, thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question from Brian Kinstlinger from Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead.
Brian Kinstlinger - Sidoti & Company: Hi, guys. Two follow-ups. I want to talk about R&D for a little bit. I think from your, from your -- I didn't know if you mentioned it today, but in your guidance call you talked about increased R&D and you discussed it a little bit today, looks like you're budgeting for almost 50% more R&D. First of all, can you give us a sense of how many people you plan to have on that Microsoft opportunity versus -- development versus how many you have now and give me a sense of what else you're spending on? My guess is education but maybe split it out and quantify where most of the money is going?
John Marr: Yes. I think you're right. Some of the education and the Microsoft projects are what you see in R&D and as you know, while we invest significantly in our existing products that are deployed, they're generally expensed to cost of maintenance. We haven't disclosed specific staffing levels. We think of that as a little bit proprietary and competitive but I think I've said before that we had several dozen people that we were gearing up to and reached that early in the year and we're certainly looking at maybe say a 50% increase in what was the target number that we certainly achieved by the middle of the year sometime in the second quarter, and we're probably looking about 50% more bodies on that that we're gearing toward right now.
Brian Kinstlinger - Sidoti & Company: And would you say that, I mean could you quantify sort of versus the total R&D spend just as percentages can you give us a sense of roughly how much is that plan for Microsoft project versus education versus and maybe what else is in there in percentages?
John Marr: Brian, I would say significantly more for the Microsoft project. I don't –
Brian Miller: Yes, I'd say more than half of it is on the Microsoft project, education and other enhancements and other products would be scattered through there and we don't really break out our spending by product area.
Brian Kinstlinger - Sidoti & Company: Great thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Trey Kuppin from Banc of America.
Trey Kuppin – Banc of America: Hello.
John Marr:  Hey, Trey. We can hear you.
Trey Kuppin – Banc of America: Okay. Great, thanks. Just two quick questions. First, getting back to operating margins, could you talk a little bit about I guess qualitatively excluding the recent acquisitions, would you be expecting any operating margin expansion in '08 just kind of for your core business? Could you talk a little about that?
Brian Miller: Yes, sure. We would be expecting operating margin expansions. We said that the acquisitions are expected to be slightly dilutive and that would be in the $0.01 to $0.02 a share range on an operating income basis or a net income basis but accretive to EBITDA and to cash flow. So excluding the impact of those we would be seeing margin or operating margin improvement for the year.
Trey Kuppin – Banc of America: Okay, great. And then just my other question was in terms of the Odyssey business, I know that you mentioned that the growth rates on the call. Are you expecting to see an acceleration there as some of the recent hires become more productive or what's kind of I guess a reasonable long-term growth rate for that part of the business?
John Marr: Our growth rate is going to come down year-to-year simply because the base goes up significantly. They were a pretty small part of our business two or three years ago and therefore, I think last year Odyssey alone the growth rate was over 50% and it'll come down more in the low 30s this year on an absolute dollar basis it will grow a little more than it did last year. But obviously, the rate will come down and when it's a mature unit further out will be more in line with our company. But, I would expect for the next say three years certainly that it will have a growth rate pretty meaningfully in excess of our company growth rate, but not I think the 50 year -- 50% growth rate last year was probably too high going forward given the bigger base.
Trey Kuppin – Banc of America: Okay, great thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eden Steinberg from Unidentified Company. Please go ahead with your question.
Eden Steinberg – Unidentified Company: Hi, guys. Question for you. What was the share count at the very end of the quarter?
Brian Miller: At the end of the quarter we have -- well today we have 37.96 million shares outstanding and at the end of the quarter it's a little higher than that. Hang on a second.
Eden Steinberg – Unidentified Company: That’s fine, that’s actually what I was going to ask. So, that’s after the 814,000 in January?
Brian Miller: That’s correct.
Eden Steinberg – Unidentified Company: And then, can you give us any kind of sense of what the appetite is to continue to buy stock, I think you said you had 960 something left?
Brian Miller: Yes. We would expect our stock repurchase program to continue to be active. We're somewhat opportunistic with it. We take into account our cash flow, the seasonality of that, our M&A opportunities, where we stand with those, level of spending on R&D. So all the uses of cash and look at stock repurchases as one of those opportunities that we've obviously been very active consistently over the last few years and have consistently executed on our repurchase authorizations. We'd expect to do so, but at this point we wouldn't want to predict exactly how that will fall out, but we should continue to stay active.
Eden Steinberg – Unidentified Company: And if you're at under 38 million now, I think you guys said that 40.5 million you were assuming in the EPS guidance?
Brian Miller: Fully diluted. So we're 30.960 million is the primary share, the actual shares outstanding and the difference is obviously the options, the options in the diluted.
Eden Steinberg – Unidentified Company: What's the current fully diluted share count?
Brian Miller: For the year, the fully diluted -- for the year the fully diluted was 40.358 million so the spread is about 2.4 million from basic to fully diluted, is that --?
Eden Steinberg – Unidentified Company: But, sorry, I don't mean to belabor this, but I'm confused. The share count currently after the January buyback diluted is 37.96?
Brian Miller: No I'm sorry, that's the primary. That's before the dilutive effect.
Eden Steinberg – Unidentified Company: What do you think the diluted after the January buying is?
Brian Miller: It would be about 2.4 million above that number.
Eden Steinberg – Unidentified Company: Okay. And then, but I’m showing the fully diluted for the average in the December quarter was about -- was just over 40, which would be the same number?
Brian Miller: It’s about 40.4 and the fully diluted would be --
John Marr: I think our annual estimate assumes a higher stock price is probably that difference. So, you get about a 2 million share spread, what we talked about at the end of the quarter, but we have to assume the stock price to do the calculation for fully dilution. And I think we assume a little higher stock price than where we traded and as we traded down a little bit in the fourth quarter which gives you another few hundred thousand shares on the fully diluted calculation.
Eden Steinberg – Unidentified Company: Okay.
John Marr: I think that's the difference.
Eden Steinberg – Unidentified Company: What price are you assuming to get to 40.5 million for ’08?
John Marr: It's in the high $14 range so that's probably a little conservative based on the current market.
Eden Steinberg – Unidentified Company: Okay. Alright, thanks guy’s nice quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Kinstlinger from Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead with your question.
Brian Kinstlinger - Sidoti & Company: Guys, this will be my last question, sorry. I wanted to ask about the appraisal services business. A while back before you were even CEO, John, you walked in obviously it was declining business to hurt you guys. I just want to try to understand given Ohio has ramped down in case of other things ramping down what is the breakeven revenue for that business now since you cut costs about a year and a half ago?
John Marr: We haven't really -- what we've really tried to go do is go above that kind of the opposite way, which is the way we manage that and what they've really worked hard to do is to develop an organization that can scale up and down within what our reasonable revenue expectations and maintain their margins . So, we believe we're organized. Obviously your margins are going to change somewhat, but stay within a reasonable level whether we do a $16 million in appraisal services or $23 million or $24 million and we don't -- that would be about as broad a range as we could imagine. So, we've kind of gone about it that way. The margins could come down a few percent on the lower end of that or go up another 100, 150 basis points on the high end of that. But that's kind of the way we're managing that.
Brian Miller: But we generally expect that revenues either increases or decreases year-over-year would be in the single-digits in that business so it would operate within a narrower range of revenue.
Brian Kinstlinger - Sidoti & Company: So unless there's like a quarter of your revenue comes out that's still going to be a profitable division?
John Marr: Yes. We really -- I mean -- there are always extreme situations that can create results we're not looking for, but I think the range in the revenues there is literally a few million dollars, which is a few -- which is pretty insignificant to our overall revenue level and I think they’re even at their operating margin level that you're talking about a couple hundred basis point swing. So, we feel as long as nothing that we can't imagine would happen that that is not a real threat to our overall performance and the revenues are now relatively insignificant to the overall company.
Brian Kinstlinger - Sidoti & Company: So, any other large contracts coming off of in Ohio in the next year?
Brian Miller: No large ones. Ohio was a whole series of contracts. Ohio was all on -- all the counties are on one revaluation cycle, so there were a number of projects going on at the same time that wound down and we are ramping up this year on the New Orleans revaluation that replaces a large part of those revenues. So, it's -- again it's within a relatively narrow band that we would expect to see the revenues vary from what we have in our plans.
Brian Kinstlinger - Sidoti & Company: Thank you again.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Rich Wilkinson from Deltech. Please go ahead with your question.
Rich Wilkinson - Deltech: Good afternoon gentlemen. Whenever I see a number of small acquisitions in a single segment I begin to wonder about product overlap. In your school segment do you see overlap between the product lines of these acquired companies and, if so, what do you plan to do about that?
John Marr: Well, we've got different types of companies we're acquiring there. Some of those companies have products that are good solid products currently, perform well for their existing base and are still attractive to the market and we'll support and extend the life of those products as far as they would have been able to go on their own. But in some cases those customers will have other Tyler products that we were already developing or already have as follow-on products further down the road. So, in those cases there's overlap, but there's synergies and a good fit where we would have a product we're already building that down the road after the useful life of those existing products has expired, that we would have some real scale in those areas where we have that overlap. And if you look at Schoolmaster, for example, it's a different geography. It's a good product, good customer set and at some point in time those people need be to looking at next generation, and we would have products to offer them. And then there are others. So the answer is both like VersaTrans, which is our transportation acquisition that we did in January and that's an entirely new product, completely complementary to what we already do and yet it's a significant need by schools. It's basically bus routing and scheduling and those sorts of things which all of us who live in a school community know is a significant task for the schools. So every school needs something like that. They're a leader in that space and offering that product through our national sales channel and into our installed base, should be a real good opportunity for us and it’ll give us a broader offering that'll be hard to match by other people in the space. So, in some cases like VersaTrans it's broadening our offering without any overlap and in other cases it's more of a customer base and a geography that we can access, and we'll support those products throughout whatever useful life they could have and offer follow-on products beyond that.
Rich Wilkinson - Deltech: Thank you very much. Congratulations on your quarter.
John Marr: Okay, thank you.
Operator: At this time there appears to be no more questions. Mr. Marr I will return the call over to you for closing remarks.
John Marr: I appreciate all of you joining us on the call today. If there are any further questions feel free to contact Brian and myself. Thank you and have a great day.
