===== 2025 Q1  (2025-05-06 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day. I'd like to welcome everyone to Corpay's First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Eglseder, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jim Eglseder: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today for our earnings call to discuss the first quarter 2025 results. With me today are Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO; and Alissa Vickery, interim CFO. Following the prepared comments, the operator will announce that the queue will open for the Q&A session. Today's documents, including our earnings release and supplement can be found under the Investor Relations section of our website at corpay.com. Now, throughout this call, we will be covering several non-GAAP financial metrics, including revenues, net income and net income per diluted share, all on an adjusted basis. We will also be covering organic revenue growth. This metric neutralizes the impact of year-over-year changes in FX rates, fuel prices and fuel spreads. It also includes pro forma results for acquisitions and divestitures closed throughout the two years being compared. None of these measures are calculated in accordance with GAAP, so may be different than that at other companies. Reconciliations of the historical non-GAAP to the most directly comparable GAAP information can be found in today's press release and on our website. It's important to understand that our comments may include forward-looking statements, which reflect the information we have currently. All statements about our outlook, expected macro environment, new products and expectations regarding business development and future acquisitions or synergies are based on that information. They are not guarantees of future performance, and you should not put undue reliance upon them, and we undertake no obligation to update any of these statements. These expected results are also subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release and on Form 8-K and in our annual report on Form 10-K. These documents are available on our website and at sec.gov. With that out of the way, I'll turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron?
Ron Clarke: Okay. Jim, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q1 2025 earnings call. Upfront here, I plan to cover three subjects. So first, provide my take on Q1 results, along with the rest of your guidance; second, cover our recent M&A activity. And then lastly, I'll share a progress update on our 2025 top priorities. Okay. Let me begin with our Q1 results. We reported Q1 2025 revenue of $1.6 billion. That's up 8% and cash EPS of $451 million that's up 10%. Cash EPS would be up 18% and on constant macro. The results really right in line with expectations, along with the environment coming in mostly as expected. Organic revenue growth in the quarter, 9% and overall. Our two big businesses doing quite well. Vehicle payments 8% organic revenue growth. and corporate payments, 19% organic revenue growth. Operating trends in the quarter, quite good. Same-store sales finished positive plus 1%. Our retention stayed steady at 92% and sales or new bookings way up -- up 35% versus Q1 last year. And again, that's on the back of up 36% sales growth in Q4. So look, despite really everything going on, the business performed as planned here in Q1. All right. Let me make the turn to our rest-of-year forecast. So first off, macro -- the factors that affect us really setting up to be effectively neutral forecast versus our prior guide. So the forward curves for FX, fuel, and SOFR have moved just a bit, but essentially zeroed out in terms of their impact on our business. Obviously, with that said, we do acknowledge that the overall macro environment is quite uncertain, but we're just not seeing anything yet, that causes us to revise our forecast. Additionally, our revenue flash for April looks to be spot on our forecast. So as a result, we're pretty much maintaining our full-year 2025 guidance at the midpoint as follow. So $4 billion to $4.20 billion in revenue guide at the midpoint and sticking with $21 in-cash EPS. The slightly increased full-year guide reflects the Gringo acquisition in Brazil, and that's net of the $6 million unfavorable spread shortfall we saw in Q1. So with this updated full-year guide, we're still expecting full-year organic revenue growth of 11% at the midpoint. Inside of that, Corporate Payments business expected to grow high-teens to 20% for the full year. As it relates to tariffs, we're not a particularly sensitive tariff stock that is, we won't directly pay tariffs. Our businesses are services, not goods. Our international businesses in the U.K. and Brazil operate intra-country, so not subject to tariffs. So the direct tariff exposure that we have is really limited to our Cross-Border business, where it does rely on our Cross-Border clients trading across borders. We have included a slide in our supplement that shows a bit less than 20% of our Cross-Border business will actually be affected by U.S. tariff policies. So look, all of this is to say that our business is not directly impacted much by U.S. tariff policy. But certainly, we're not immune to our clients, being negatively affected by tariffs, and that could ultimately soften their volumes with us. Okay. Let me make the transition to our recent M&A activity. We have announced a couple of exciting deals here in the last week. So last week, we announced a strategic Cross-Border partnership with Mastercard. So in that case, Mastercard will invest $300 million for about a 3% share in our Cross-Border business. That does value our Cross-Border unit in excess of $10 billion. Second, we signed a commercial agreement to be Mastercard's exclusive, provider of Cross-Border services to their clients to their FI clients. And we think this financial institution partnership could add about 2% to 3% incremental revenue growth to our Cross-Border business beginning next year. Secondly, just announced that we're making a $500 million minority investment into Avid. That's alongside the take private transaction with TPG. Many of you know Avid a leader in B2B invoice automation and payments and they do see pretty distinct verticals from our payables business. We're out looking the investment in Avid to be accretive to our earnings in 2026 and really throughout the forecast period. Our agreement with TPG does provide us a call option to acquire the remaining equity of Avid down the road. So pretty exciting. So these two corporate payment acquisitions for sure, strengthen our position in the space and do provide us the option to dramatically scale up our position over time. Lastly, we are looking a bit harder at divesting three of our non-core or less related businesses. Taken together, those three businesses could provide upwards of $2 billion of incremental liquidity if we are to transact. We'll obviously keep you posted. Okay. Let me make the turn to our 2025 top priorities. So in the February earnings call, we laid out four priorities for 2025. And here's a bit of the progress. So first, the portfolio. We said our goal was to expand our corporate payments business mix. We're doing just that with the Mastercard and Avid transactions. And in addition, we are still looking some additional corporate targets in our pipeline. So the goal, again, fewer bigger businesses. Second priority, USA sales, we did have a good Q1 USA sales result. USA sales up 25% year-over-year. We have staffed a new cross-sell team that goes back to our client base and the new Zoom sales team, both of those groups now live and in market. We have developed a new Corpay brand ad campaign that we expect to be in the market later this quarter to further support USA sales. Third, payables. So on the payables front, we did just go live with the enterprise client I mentioned in February, so far, so good. We do expect the single mega client will process over 30 billion. 30 billion in annual spend with us. So a significant opportunity. We do expect to launch our new payables product in the U.K. using our kind of next-gen tech this summer. So super excited to bring that product to our second biggest market. And then lastly, on the cross-border front, we're making a major push into this new segment for us. This institutional client segments, so think PE firms asset managers. So we're doing that with our new multi-currency products. So progress is quite good. We've signed over 2,000 new clients already since launch, and we've aggregated $800 million of total deposit balances. So off to a good start. So pretty pleased with progress here against our four top priorities. So look, in conclusion today, again, Q1 financial results finishing really on plan, maintaining rest of year, full year 2025 financial guidance. That's based on what we're seeing. We are expanding our corporate payments segments with additional acquisition targets still in front of us. And as you can tell, laser-focused on our 2025 top priorities and advancing them. So with that, let me turn the call back over to Alissa to provide some additional details on the quarter. Alissa?
Alissa Vickery: Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. Here are some additional details related to the quarter. The first quarter was a good start to the year with our business is exhibiting strong organic revenue growth of 9% overall, right in line with our expectations. Our print revenue of $1.06 billion was up 8% over last year. Normalizing for macro, Q1 revenue would have been $1.013 billion, slightly ahead of the midpoint of our guide. Our revenues were impacted by approximately $6 million of unfavorable fuel spread revenue compared to our February expectation as there was little volatility in prices in the quarter, which led to the fuel spread revenue headwind. Adjusted EPS increased 10% over last year to $4.51 per share. As Ron mentioned, performance drivers during the quarter were strong and were paired with solid expense management, fewer shares outstanding partially offset by a higher tax rate. We completed the acquisition of Gringo in March, which had an immaterial impact on revenue and adjusted EPS. In summary, the quarter generated strong top and bottom line growth on a constant macro basis while maintaining strong margins and included significantly higher sales that should fuel rose over the balance of the year. Turning to our segment performance and the underlying drivers of revenue growth. Corporate Payments revenue was up 19% organically during the quarter, driven by solid spend volumes, which also increased 19% organically in the quarter. Our corporate payment solutions continue to sell extremely well with payables revenue up 19% organically, including direct sales up 30% year-over-year. Within sales, we signed two new channel partners in the quarter. Cross-border sales grew 51% for the quarter compared to the prior year, and revenue increased 18% organically. We did see heightened activity throughout the quarter, driven by FX rate volatility from tariff policy changes. But much of that early benefit was given back in March as uncertainty caused US goods-based volumes to soften somewhat. Active and volume did rebound in April post announcement of the 90-day tariff pause. We've already migrated most of our GPS customers from the 2024 acquisition onto our Corpay platform with remaining migration planned to be completed by the end of the third quarter. This positions us well to cross-sell our sophisticated risk management solutions to GPS' customers. Clearly, US trade policy and tariffs are challenges for our customers as they operate today and look forward Cross-border is a global business for us, where we help customers pay for both services and goods. Services have been largely excluded from the tariff policy changes to date. So for the remainder of 2025, we expect tariff impacts to be relatively modest unfavorably impacting our cross-border revenue by approximately $10 million to $15 million based on our assumptions. We've provided additional details on Slide 20 in our earnings supplement. Turning to vehicle payments. Our revenue grew 8% organically during the quarter, consistent with the fourth quarter of 2024. In Brazil, toll tags increased 8% year-over-year with more than a third of our customer spending coming from our extended network. Active insurance policies increased more than 50% and Kardex users were up 40%. We closed the Gringo acquisition in March, and we continue to be excited about the significant opportunity in the Kardex space. Our app-based strategy, growth of offerings as well as consistent sales execution, powered Brazil organic revenue growth of 22% for the quarter. In international vehicle payments, revenue grew 8% organically for the quarter. Consistent strong sales, array of products and channels, notably EV offerings throughout the UK and Europe and continued geographic diversification are the drivers of these results. I'm delighted to say we have resigned our existing reseller agreement with Shell for another fives years to manage Shell fuel and EV cards in multiple markets across Europe. In US vehicle payments, revenue growth was down 3% organically but we continue to see improvement in new customer application approvals, growth in sales to our lower to mid-market customers and better retention. In the revamped US sales organization, we are focused on standardizing performance criteria to manage sales with incremental investment and brand awareness to drive mid-market growth in leads. Lodging organic revenue growth for the quarter was down 1% compared to down 9% in the first quarter of 2024. So a big improvement over last year. Room nights increased 19%, led by the workforce business, which was particularly active as a result of last fall's hurricanes and wildfires as well as improved new sales. Airline revenues were lower due to tough prior year comps and volume softness. To accelerate US sales growth, we are focused on building a single unified Corpay go-to-market strategy by combining people, processes and measurements across US vehicle payments, workforce lodging and most of our payables products, led by our Chief Revenue Officer. We are building scalable infrastructure and are seeing early returns with double-digit growth in bookings across each of these lines of business. We continue to gain traction in leveraging our product portfolio across our client base, propelled by our unified brand with meaningful growth in website traffic and a strong sales pipeline, while also having sales representatives focused on cross-selling and upselling to our existing customers. In summary, we are pleased with the performance of our business to start the year. Now looking further down the income statement. First quarter operating expenses of $579 million increased 8% versus the first quarter of last year. As a reminder, we acquired three businesses in 2024. Zapay in March, Paymerang in July and GPS in December and disposed of our Merchant Solutions business in December. The net impact of these transactions resulted in incremental operating expenses of approximately $40 million in the first quarter of 2025 over the prior year. Excluding the M&A activity and normalizing for lower FX rates, operating expenses increased approximately 5% versus Q1 of last year. The increase in operating expense was driven by higher transaction volumes and sales activities to drive future growth. Bad debt expense as a percentage of spend was 5 basis points, consistent with Q1 of last year. To better understand our operating performance, we evaluate EBITDA with and without the impact of add-backs. Consistent with those adjustments and our cash net income definition to the extent they are operating expenses. We refer to this metric as adjusted EBITDA or cash EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 55.2%, consistent with Q1 of prior year. Interest expense this quarter increased 7% year-over-year, due to higher balances related to capital deployment, partially offset by lower interest rates and higher interest income due to higher deposit balances. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.5% compared with 24.7% in Q1 of last year, with the change driven primarily by the mix of earnings. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with the balance sheet in excellent shape, with a leverage ratio at 2.69 times, which is down 6 bps from year end. As we mentioned on the last call, we raised $750 million of additional Term Loan B debt and used the proceeds to pay down the revolver in the first quarter. We have over $2.5 billion of cash and revolver availability, at the end of the quarter, which gives us ample capacity to pursue acquisitions. As Ron mentioned, we announced an expansion or our partnership with Mastercard to deliver an enhanced suite of corporate cross-border payment solutions, which includes Mastercard investing $300 million for an approximate 3% stake in our cross-border business unit. We expect this transaction to close in the second half of 2025. Our capital allocation in the quarter was limited, as we spent $59 million on share buybacks associated with employee option exercises, and $164 million for Gringo. Given the sell-off of our stock this year, we are buyers of our stock, but our first priority remains M&A. Meaningful M&A cycles are few and far between, so we want to take advantage of them when they present and the pipeline is very active. So now let me share some additional information on our updated 2025 full year and Q2 outlook. While the forward FX and fuel price curves have changed since our February call, the net effect of the macro factors on the rest of year financial outlook is a wash. Here are the puts and takes. Fuel prices are now expected to be $2.96, approximately 9% lower. The US dollar is now weaker against most currencies, other than the Brazil Real, interest rates are slightly better, and tariffs have a slightly unfavorable impact to our cross border unit. Consequently, we’re maintaining our 2025 guidance, and now adding Gringo, which adds to revenue but is neutral to cash EPS. Based on the current environment, we are maintaining our expectation of 10% to 12% organic revenue growth, and $21.00 of cash EPS at the midpoint. There is a currently a lot of noise about if and how the demand environment will change in response to tariff uncertainty and sentiment deterioration. Through April, we’re not seeing any meaningful change in customer behavior, so it’s difficult to handicap what might happen. What we do know is that the majority of our products are B2B and intra-country focused, generally not discretionary, and provide a more efficient way to pay for what our customers are buying. There has been a lot of volatility with FX rates and the global economic outlook, but to-date, we’re not seeing any meaningful impact to our business. If economic activity and the outlook change, we’ll be nimble in adjusting our spending as warranted, but today we are maintaining our full year financial estimates. For the second quarter, we expect print revenue growth of 12% to 14%, and print cash EPS to grow 11% to 13%. On a constant year-over-year macro basis, we expect organic revenue growth of 12% and Cash EPS to increase 18%, at the midpoint, compared to the second quarter of last year. We’ve provided additional details regarding our rest of year and second quarter outlook in our press release and earnings supplement. So now operator, we'd like to open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Tien-tsin Huang: Thanks a lot, Ron. You've been real busy, I know. I want to ask on the two deals. Maybe first on Mastercard. Just give us a little bit more on your confidence level in getting this 2 to 3 points of incremental revenue growth out of the agreement we've seen these kind of partnerships before. And of course, Mastercard's got a ton of reach with banks. But ultimately, the banks still have to promote it. So, what kind of line of sight do you have into that. The energy that it's going to get put into that -- to drive that 2 to 3 points?
Ron Clarke: Hey, Tien-tsin, good to hear voice. So I think the opportunity is just so big. I think if Mastercard dedicated people get us introduced, that this thing will go. And I say that again because the clients of these Tier 2 banks pay half of these payments in U.S. dollars. So I think when our people show up, and can provide that kind of benefit. I think it's going to be big. I do think the question is how long -- remember the space, there's a handful of us independents like us all the rest of cross-border dollars are done at banks. And so the size of the flow sitting there are just massive. And so this is, for sure, a marathon thing, but I think lining up with them creates just enormous opportunity over the cycle.
Tien-Tsin Huang: Yes. It seems aligned with what the banks want to do in terms of monetization of front end. But yes, just curious on that, that's good to hear. Just on the Avid one. Interesting deal. Maybe the simple high-level question and let you opine on this. Just -- is this a financial investment or a strategic one? I mean it could be both. You have a call option. But to see you do the minority deal in somewhat of a mid-market, I'm just curious how passive or active you'll be as an investor in Avid?
Ron Clarke: Yes, it's a good question, strategic for sure, right? We have said repeatedly, we want to be bigger in corporate payments and particularly in the payables portion of that. And so this is a terrific asset and stuff. And so for us, it's just seeing progress really on profit acceleration, which we got a bit of a line of sight into. And so we are super hopeful that the company will progress that, and we'll be in a spot to acquire that company in a few years. So that's the primary basis that we're going into this.
Tien-Tsin Huang: Understood. Good time. Thank you, Ron.
Ron Clarke: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to Andrew Jeffrey with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Andrew Jeffrey: Hi. I appreciate you taking the question. Yes, a lot of good stuff going on here. Ron, when you think about the Avid investment and the option seems to be a great way to go about it, can you talk specifically to their network as well as your own AP business just around monetization rates. And I assume that strategic investment as you terminated this nature indicates the confidence ability to improve card attach and monetization. I know new sales are a big part of that, too. But can you speak to the monetization piece and your confidence to be able to drive card acceptance and/or ACH pricing?
Ron Clarke: Yes, I think it's high. In some ways, Avid has done really even a better job than we have, right? Their revenue mix includes a fair amount of just standalone software fees, they've also advanced what they call kind of paid for or ACH for us getting paid for sending ACH. So, I think I think that they've made great progress on that. And so -- to your point, I think this is for us less about confidence in those networks because they're already both super scale. It's really on the buy side. The game is for both of us to sign up more spend right to run through that network. And then in their case, to realize some scale effectively to have the incremental revenue flow through at way higher margins. So those are really the two things that we're key in on. It's really acceleration in buyer sales or spend and then really flow through of the increment into earnings. If they do those two things, we'll be over the moon.
Andrew Jeffrey: Yeah. That makes sense. And as a quick follow-up, you mentioned enterprise last quarter as a new thrust within the corporate payments business. Can you give us an update there in terms of pipeline?
Ron Clarke: Yeah, it's live. So I think what we said, first of all, is a slight bit accidental right, that we kind of stumbled into this thing six months ago, having been a middle market focus. So we did contract this one mega account, and we have gone live. So that is kind of starting to ramp. And so I think I said in the last call that I tried to hold the horses a bit at the coral to make sure that this thing works, gets out of the blocks, works well for the client. But we do have -- I think we mentioned the big consulting firms that facilitated the introduction that have already kind of run out to a handful of incremental prospects. So I think what I said still holds to the extent that we get success in this initial account and call that account referenceable, I think you'll see us start to move forward with additional accounts. So this is this is a big incremental opportunity in the payable space for us. Again, the size of it, right, that, call it, four or five of these accounts are literally the size of our entire business today.
Andrew Jeffrey: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Shrion [ph] for Ramsey. Thanks for taking my questions. So my first question is on the Avid exchange investment. So in your press release, you mentioned that the take private transaction structure gives Avid the flexibility to transform and accelerate profit growth. And Ron, I know you hit on it a little bit, but -- I know it's still very early on in the process, but I was just wondering what kinds of strategic initiatives this could entail.
Ron Clarke: Yeah. It's really just a -- it's a scale question, right? The company whatever, 20-plus years old, they built the foundation with software, they've been in pad that we've helped them with for 20 years. And so I think they're getting to a scale now $400 million to $500 million in revenue, where we're looking for the increment, call it, the next $200 million to $300 million of revenue to just flow through at just a much higher rate, which I think it will because the foundation like the network of suppliers to tech the sales structure, a bunch of the foundational work has been in place. And so I think it's literally as simple as that, if they can add more spend to the wheel here, we think flow-through will be significantly better and margins will accrete. So that's, again, what we're looking for.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you. And then as a quick follow-up. Earlier in the call, you called out that outside of your cross-border business, any tariff impact would be indirect in nature. So I was wondering if you could help us think through what this indirect impact might look like in vehicle paint specifically. Would it be isolated to your OTR business or in particular geographies? And then could you potentially deploy pricing as an offset?
Ron Clarke: Yeah. I mean, I think probably like everyone on the call like who knows, right, when something is indirect, right? We're not going to pay tariffs directly. And so hey, we have all flavors of clients. So I think you're your comments, a good one that clients of ours that have goods as their business instead of services, so think an 18-wheel who moves products around could be more impacted than local businesses that do plumbing, or HVAC. And so, certainly, our mix would affect a little bit what happens. But we just -- like everyone on this call, we don't really have any kind of view at all of how much any of these accounts will be effective. We just know that as a company and as a stock, we're not in the gun side to this. We won't pay tariffs, again, we're mostly a services business and really the only business with any kind of smidge and direct exposure is cross-border. And then as we put a slide in the supplement that only about 20% of those flows are on goods and two are from the US. And so even there, the impact is limited. So really, it's just a function of what happens to the plant and to all the businesses out there. There curve a little bit it, buyer we'll be here a little bit. The hurdle on buyer will be up, but we're not going to be hurdled directly by it is our message.
Unidentified Analyst: Very helpful. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And next, we're going to go to Andrew Schmidt with Citi. Please go ahead.
Andrew Schmidt: Hi, Ron. Hey, Alissa. Congrats on all the progress here. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask about the US business within the vehicle payments. It sounds like you're pretty optimistic around the sales trends there and maybe just comment around just the confidence in driving improvement in revenue there as the year progresses, obviously, macro aside, but would love to get some details based on the sales trends and initiatives you have there? Thanks so much.
Ron Clarke: Hey, Andrew, it's Ron. It's a super good question. So I'd say the -- it's a two-part answer. The first part is really retention. And so we went on the great deal [ph] with you guys about the great pivot of the US vehicle business a couple of years ago and getting out of micro accounts and buying all that stuff. And I can report that that is now distant in our rearview mirror. And so what's come out of that, let me just quote this to you that the retention rate for that entire US business in Q1 of 2025 are improved more than 200 basis points from Q1 of 2024. So the loss rate in that business used to be of a nine and on the call, low 9%, 9.5%, and now it has a seven handle. So that's the first message is obviously getting 200 to 250 points back prospectively, and we think that will even get a smidge better is the first point. And then on the second point, yes, the sales relative to the base is up. And the forecast that we have sitting here says that we think the first half is, call it, flat, and the second half is literally mid-single digits or better. So we're sitting here on this call, telling you that we think there is a big pivot in organic revenue growth coming in that business here in whatever in 60 days. And then if we get that all of a sudden, our organic growth rate steps way up because that's a pretty big business. So I'd say our confidence is high because we're good at math, and we captured the retention number already as we thought we would when we made that change. So we're finally, after this time, we're going to start to see some benefits from that decision.
Andrew Schmidt: Got it. Thank you, Ron. Yes, retention is a big lever. So that's good to hear. Every time we see macro fluctuations. We always get the question on sort of supplier acceptance trends within the AP business. It doesn't sound like there's been much variation based on the commentary. But maybe just talk about what you hear from suppliers in terms of payment choice, things like that, whether there's been any change on that front? Thanks so much.
Ron Clarke: Yes. It's a good call. So no, is the answer. That number is basically flat. It's kind of remaining flat. And I think it's just what you'd expect, which is payment certainty, suppliers want to get paid, right, and not default and payment speed are high importance. So any supply that runs good margins like service businesses, like an example that run 50%, 70% marginal cost basically. They love car products because they're certain and they're fast. And so I think the answer is we're not seeing really all that much different. And so that back to the comp the same thing I said about to have is that as our payables business goes as spend goes. If we can keep growing the buyer side and increasing spend, we think, if anything, we'll take up the monetization as we add more ACH plus ourselves into the network. So we're not seeing really any downtick there yet.
Andrew Schmidt: That’s great to hear. Thank you, Ron.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, I do ask you to limit yourself to one question to allow everyone to be able to ask their questions. We'll next go to Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead.
Sanjay Sakhrani: Thank you. Good afternoon and congrats on this Avid minority ownership. Ron, could I just follow up a little bit on the acceleration of the sales at Avid? Like how exactly will you guys be involved in that? Will you actually like sell the product? Have your sales -- I'm just trying to think about that part of it. And then just on expenses, obviously, there might be some redundancies between what you guys do and they do? Is there any plans to sort of get involved on the expense rationalization there? And just one final one, just what are the terms of the call option in 2027? Thanks.
Ron Clarke: That was kind of a three-part of the Sanjay, if I was listening. So let me see if I can go back and remember part one. So on hey, our involvement in Avid sales, you got a good guy in my opinion, running the place and you've got some good leaders there with Mike. And so I think our role is that we've been a part of the idea side of, okay, maybe being helpful in terms of priority and where to point and sharing some practices that we think in some investments that we think may help them perform better. But we wouldn't have made this investment if we didn't have some confidence that they could do it. In terms of synergies in this early hold period, Avid is going to run kind of as Avid. But clearly, we thought about and sized what I call our second bite which would be if, in fact, we get a few years out and we like the profit growth, profit acceleration there. There's a pretty labor incremental synergy right through combination to your like, whether it's the merchant network or the tech side or other things. So we would really plan to choose step that. It will run mostly kind of as it is, we'll be helpful where we can. And then if that day comes, that we try to buy the rest, we'll get the second bite. On the terms front, we're basically going to kick the can and provide that detailed disclosure in our Q, which will be probably later this week on Monday. We'll lay out more of the details of the thing. But at the high level, what you said is right, which is we've taken a minority position along with TPG and management and basically have the option a couple of years out to buy the rest of the equity. So we'll fill in the details a different day.
Sanjay Sakhrani: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Andrew Bauch with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Andrew Bauch: Hi, guys. It's similar on for Andrew. Thanks for taking the question. It's good to see the progress that you're making on the payables front in terms of moving upmarket to the enterprise segment and that one win that you called out and the intention to, I guess, expand into the U.K. this summer. I guess with the noise around tariffs or the incremental macro uncertainty, maybe just give us an update if there's been any kind of kind of like revised thoughts around like the of that expansion over the coming months. Thank you.
Jim Eglseder : Mark, can you repeat the last stuff or that you kind of broke out?
Andrew Bauch: No, I would just ask with the incremental macro is starting to kind of like the comments that you made around the tariff implications on cross-border if there are any revised stocks as it relates to the scale of that expansion, whether it be moving upmarket to enterprise or the U.K. met the payments expansion in the U.K.
Ron Clarke : Yes. I'm sorry, I'm sure I hear the question, but I think you're asking, hey, in the payables group. We're happy about the enterprise, the adjacent enterprise fairness there and then going to the U.K., I think the answer is yes. Like we said, we've gone live for the first account this partners induce us to the next set of people. And so this is really just walk before you run. We want to make sure the thing working, and we're doing well. But the size of the step that we could get if it's successful, is large. And then the U.K. thing, again, is an intra market thing, right? We're taking a product that's here and it's going to help clients in the U.K. So there won't be really specific any tariff impacts of that. It's really a product that will be used by U.K. businesses for purchases there. And then to the extent that they have cross-border payments there, which, again, two-thirds or three-fourth f those will be into the continent of Europe or in Asia or other places. So yes, we don't think that that's going to have really any bearing on the launch. We're just excited to stand up a super important business in a second market that adds TAM and leverages like all the assets, all the clients, all the people and stuff that we have there. So that's really what we're trying to tell people is going to make this a way bigger business.
Andrew Bauch: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And next, we'll go to James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
James Faucette: Hi. Thanks a lot for the question and all the details today. I wanted to turn to another topic really quickly, Ron, I'm curious hear about the performance of the hedging business in Q1? And anything you can give us on how it has performed since then during the month of April and early May. I'm just wondering if it's fair to think about that business as a beneficiary of sustained heightened market volatility. And can you give us kind of the puts and takes on that dynamic and any other impacts on tariffs that segment specifically?
Ron Clarke: Yes, that's a good question, James. So on our cross-border business, Q1, good. I think we reported a high teens revenue growth against the prior year and the sales, I think, grew 50% in the quarter over Q1 the prior year. So we're selling the stuff like crazy. In terms of April, we did look at the flash gangbusters, maybe the adjective I used the April flash or cross border is way ahead of our budget and our forecast and significantly ahead of the prior year -- and yes, there's no question that certainly in April that it's been a beneficiary of the uncertainty of what the heck is going on. And so to your point, what the sustainability of that is less clear. But yes, through 4 months, the business is truly rocking. With that said, I don't know how clear we were, but we did -- listen, I have $10 million or $15 million out of the second half full year guide to just be a bit conservative if the post pause tariff world is not super attractive. We want to make sure we -- we went into the second half a bit conservative, but frankly, we don't know. I just wanted to put it on the table that we decided to trim a bit the second half in the event that tariffs are meant to us.
Operator: Great. Thanks. And next, we'll go to Trevor Williams with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Trevor Williams: Great. Thanks very much. If we could go back to the organic guide, and Ron, you've given some kernels on this over the course of Q&A, but we're at organic in Q1, you're keeping the 11% for the year. It sounds like a lot of that acceleration is coming from U.S. vehicle. But if there's anything else that you could point us to? And I hear you on kind of April running in line. But just with everything on the macro, how would you frame the level of confidence in the full year and the specific drivers you guys have baked in today versus 3 months ago?
Ron Clarke: Yes, Travis. Good question. High would be the answer. So kind of interesting. We expect Q2 that we're sitting and again, we've had a look at April already. I'd say we think probably closer to 12% at the midpoint. So I know it's a big step. Hey, we just printed 9%. And although I think we printed print in Q4 to the 12 in Q4. So 12,9, I'm going to say, Trevor, 12 here in Q2. And surprisingly, the US vehicle one is not the big contributor to the big step there thing is that the gift business which was super soft in Q1 versus the prior year is going to be super strong here in Q2 against the prior year. And so, then when you go into the second half, what you said is right, then the lift is we think the US vehicle business will step into mid-single digits or plus, and that's what we'll have the back half still double digits. So 10 to 12, 13 in Q3 and Q4. So can't get you there in Q2 and then US vehicle get you there in the second half and corporate payment stays steady as you go, high teens to 20%. And again, who knows if again, some recession, we're just calling the mass, we see them. today, the data that we can read out. So obviously, all of this is a function of the world, not melting, but given what we could see confidence is high.
Tevor Williams: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And next, we'll go to Rayna Kumar with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Rayna Kumar: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Are you seeing any different trends across SMBs versus your larger fleet clients? And can you talk about same-store sales trends for both segments?
Ronald Clarke: Yeah. I'd say not much. I mean, I think historically, our middle market enterprise clients have been steadier but I think we did such a cleaning such a remixing starting a couple of years ago that are truly kind of micro, super small accounts or just way fewer in our portfolio. So I think that first headline is we're just way less exposed to it would be the first point. And then on the on the base, again, plus one, which is, I think, the same thing we quoted for Q4. And again, the good news is that's up 3% from Q1 of the prior year. If I remember right, Q1 of Q1 of 2024, we were minus two 2025 or plus one. So we moved that plus three over the period of time. And so the base report that I look at is pretty steady as she goes. There's not a ton of movement kind of each of the areas is kind of similar to what it was in Q4 where it was plus 1%. And so -- yes. We don't see much that's patchy. It's pretty solid right now.
Rayna Kumar: Appreciate the color.
Operator: And next, we'll go to Dave Koning with Baird. Please go ahead.
David Koning: Yeah. Hey, guys. Thank you. And I guess my question just with the Avid deal, do you guys immediately get access to their supplier network? And maybe could you talk through like if today your accounts payable as maybe you have 20% of each of their payment files on average that can go into one of your suppliers and now with Avid, does that 20% raise to 30%? I'm making up numbers, obviously, but do you have metrics like that? And am I thinking of that correctly?
Ron Clarke: Yes, Dave, it's Ron. Hey, Shawn. That's a super good question. And the good news is we have a bit of a head start on the subject you're on. So call it, I don't know, 6 to 12 months ago, Mike and I met on this very subject and created a commercial agreement, kind of arm's length agreement between the two companies to do exactly what you just said, which is to -- we had third parties look at the composition of our supplier networks and which parts of it were monetized and not and then using that data basically help each other monetize more. And so that thing has gotten lifted up already. And obviously, the deepening of the relationship now, I think we'll improve that. So we will clearly double down on that initiative. And then as I said, a different day, we would move to a complete combination of that. We just effectively think of it double the spend in the merchant network, which is -- would be obviously super synergistic, right? We create enormous leverage for us to have doubled the spend running through that set of suppliers. So that's obviously one of the attractive things for us in the second bite.
David Koning: Yes. Great. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to Rufus Hone with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Rufus Hone: Hi guys. Thanks. Maybe just a quick one on -- you mentioned some potential non-core divestitures. The $2 billion number sort of implies it could be something pretty chunky. I guess just what businesses, does that cover? Any details there would be great. Thank you.
Ron Clarke: Yes, Rufus, it's a good question. So not shockingly, the three units that we kind of teed up from our -- what we call our vehicle segment and one is from our lodging segment. So the concept here, again, is more in corporate payments, less in vehicle and lodging. And so the different message, I think, for everybody this time is bigger. So historically, we've said, hey, we're going to look for things that are less related non-core potentially divest those and kind of things on the margin. We picked two or three businesses that have more size, I think, call it, $150 million, $170 million in EBITDA combined across these three businesses. As a larger set of divestitures, a couple of them really good businesses and should fetch a pretty good price. And so the idea really is just to simplify the company more, create more liquidity in this case, $2 billion and pour it back into the pipeline in front of us at corporate payments. So it's just a more -- the message you guys is just a more aggressive or repositioning of our portfolio, I think, towards corporate payments.
Operator: Thank you. And next, we'll go to Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Ken Suchoski: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking question. Maybe I'll ask one on lodging since it wasn't covered here. But the organic growth took a step back this quarter, I know there's leap year impacts in there. But is the expectation to accelerate to mid-single-digit growth throughout the year and then ultimately get back to double-digit growth. And I'm just curious how you guys think about driving that acceleration? Thank you.
Ron Clarke: That's another good question. So the short answer for the Q1 is really all pocketed in airlines. So we built a plan for Q1 and the big part of the lodging where we serve the airlines was just super soft. Maybe the weather was good, I don't know, but the disruption sub-segment of that was super light, as was just maybe it's the Newark Airport store, I don't know. But the airline volume is super light, so all of the softness, different from our plan, was airlines. Going forward, I think we said that we built the 2025 budget and guide today really on that business staying kind of flattish. It was declining. And so the goal was to get it stood out back towards level again. And that we would make sales here in 2025. So that business is a good business again in 2026. So there's nothing in our forecast that things going to magically be much better. But the super-important headline is its not declining. The base is strong. And the retention levels are way better than they were a year to 1.5 years ago. So now it's literally just refilling the top of the bucket, so that, that thing can grow. But, so that's the update.
Ken Suchoski: Thanks Ron.
Operator: Thank you. And we'll go for our last question with Nick Cremo with UBS.
Nick Cremo: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to come back to the U.S. vehicle payments business, given a deceleration versus, I think, being up slightly quarter with strong sales last quarter as well. So can you just provide more specific color as to what drove the deceleration in Q1? And just put a finer point as to the drivers for the acceleration in the back half? Thank you.
Alissa Vickery: Yeah. Sure. Hey. It's a good question, and this is Alissa. So from a -- what drove the current quarter, I think it's just a little bit of softness. But as we continue to look towards the back half of the year, it really is the current trends in new sales that we're seeing right now continuing into the middle and the back half of the year, better retention, better same-store sales which should drive the ultimate back-half acceleration.
Nick Cremo: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jim Eglseder, with Investor Relations.
Jim Eglseder: Yeah. Thanks, guys, for your flexibility today, and staying on the call late. We know we were late into the wire, but I think you all understand why. If you have any other questions, feel free to reach out. We're happy to help where we can.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-05 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Corpay Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Jim Eglseder, Investor Relations. Thank you, Jim. You may begin.
Jim Eglseder: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today for our earnings call to discuss 2024 results both fourth quarter and full year. With me today are Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO; and Tom Panther, our CFO. Following the prepared comments, the operator will announce the queue will open for the Q&A session. Today’s documents, including our earnings release and supplement, which can be found under the Investor Relations section of our website at corpay.com. Throughout this call now, we will be covering several non-GAAP financial metrics, including revenues, net income, net income per diluted share, all on an adjusted basis. We will also be covering organic revenue growth. This metric neutralizes the impact of year-over-year changes in FX rates, fuel prices and fuel spreads. It also includes pro forma results for acquisitions and divestitures or scope changes closed during the two years being compared. None of these measures are calculated in accordance with GAAP, so may be different than other companies. Reconciliations of the historical non-GAAP to the most directly comparable GAAP information can be found in today's press release and on our website. It's important to understand that part of our discussion today may include forward-looking statements. These statements reflect the best information we have as of today. All statements about our outlook, expected macro environment, new products, and expectations regarding business development and future acquisitions are based on that information. They are not guarantees of future performance, and you should not put undue reliance upon them. We undertake no obligation to update any of these statements. These expected results are also subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. These documents are also available on our website and at sec.gov. So now, I'll turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron?
Ron Clarke: Okay, Jim. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q4 2024 earnings call. Up front here, I'll plan to cover four subjects. First, provide my take on Q4 results. Second, I'll hit the highlights for full year 2024. Third, I'll share our 2025 guidance along with the major priorities for the year. And then lastly, I'll provide a bit of an M&A update. Okay. Let me begin with our Q4 results. We reported Q4 revenue of $1,034 million, that's up 10% and cash EPS of $5.36, that's up 21%. Overall, the results really in line with our expectation. Each of our core businesses pretty much coming in as planned with accelerating revenue. The macro turned unfavorable during Q4, compressing our print revenue by about $20 million. But fortunately a favorable tax rate effectively offset the unfavorable FX, really landing us back at our expected Q4 EPS print. Kind of the same thing on the revenue front, we did pick up some unplanned GPS acquisition revenue in the quarter, but that was offset by some delayed gift card shipments. Organic revenue growth accelerating quite nicely in Q4, coming in at 12% overall. Inside of that, our corporate payments line of business finishing at 26% organic revenue growth. Quite importantly, the trends improved significantly in the quarter. Same-store sales finished positive up 1% that compares to minus 3% in Q4 last year. Sales growth crazy good accelerated to 36%, really impressive. That did include some elephant sales in the quarter. And retention remained steady at 92%. So look the wrap on the quarter, the underlying businesses really spot on our expectations. The environment both giveth and taketh and kind of zeroing out in the quarter, and then importantly our revenue, same-store sales, and sales or new bookings trends improving really quite materially in the quarter. Okay. Let me make the turn and call out a few highlights for full year 2024. I characterize it overall as really quite successful. Cash EPS of $19 was up over $2 on a print basis and up 16% versus last year excluding Russia. We did rebrand and simplify the company. Now Corpay, the Corporate Payments Company, we scaled our Corporate Payments line of business adding two acquisitions. Again sales growth for the full year over 20%. We managed credit losses to extremely low levels lower than 2023. We progressed our Vehicle Payments add-on idea, seeing real success with that in Brazil. We have hired a world class USA sales leadership team to take us forward and we have begun the slow turn of our two problem children businesses back in a positive territory. So all in all, we think a pretty good performance. Okay. Let me transition to our 2025 guidance along with our major priorities for the year. So today, we're providing full year 2025 guidance at the mid-point of $4.4 billion in revenue and $21 of cash EPS, so both of those numbers up 11%. The guidance reflects pretty strong underlying business fundamentals. So within the guide, we anticipate organic revenue growth at the mid-point of 11%. That's up a bit from our view 90 days ago. We're planning full year overall sales or new bookings growth of 20% here in 2025 and we're planning macro neutral cash EPS growth of 17%, which is in line with our mid-term earnings target. Unfortunately, we are outlooking a very unfavorable macro at the moment, a combination of weak international currencies along with a much higher tax rate. So taken together, we expect our print revenue to be compressed by over $100 million and our cash EPS to be compressed by about $1.20. Obviously, FX and SOFR forward curves can change, but we're using the January forecasts that are out there. Tom will provide some additional details on the guidance math along with specific Q1 guidance when we get to his prepared remarks. In terms of priorities, we have four major priorities here in 2025, with an emphasis on expanding our Corporate Payments business. So first priority our portfolio, we'll continue to simplify our portfolio. We'll go deeper versus wider. We will look to shed some additional non-core assets and we'll look to add more Corporate Payment assets, so already quite active on this front. Second, USA sales, we are planning a step change improvement in USA sales production this year. We plan to invest more in the Corpay brand, scale our field and zoom sales teams and progress our dedicated cross-sell team. Third, on the Payables front, we'll take our Payables business upmarket to the Enterprise segment, that's in addition to our core middle market focus. We have secured our first big enterprise win, so quite exciting. Additionally, we're going to expand our Payables business into Europe this year and launch our Corpay complete Payables product in the UK. We do have lots of UK assets to help us get going there. And then, finally, the priority in Cross-Border will expand our MCA or Multi-Currency Account Product that holds multiple currencies for our clients as deposits, really making it easier for clients to expand the countries that they participate in. This could be really a game changer to help us compete with banks on the Cross-Border front. So all in all, a pretty exciting set of initiatives planned this year. Okay, last up; let me run through just a brief M&A update. So first, our two 2024 Corporate Payment acquisitions, Paymerang and GPS well underway integrating both of those businesses into our tech environment and executing on our synergy plans. We're still on track to deliver $0.50 of cash EPS accretion from these two deals here in 2025. Second, Gringo, it's our second Brazil mobile payments acquisition. We announced that on Monday. So this acquisition along with last year's ZaPay acquisition, gives us entry into a pretty big Brazil payments TAM. It's in fact about 3x larger than our toll TAM and quite early days in terms of its digital penetration. So taken together, these couple of deals will add 5 million active monthly digital users, all of whom become potential buyers for our Vehicle Payments Solutions, including toll, parking, insurance, and even fueling. Lastly, we do have a pretty active pipeline of Corporate Payment acquisitions opportunities here in front of us. The goal obviously to increase our Corporate Payment mix, which could lead to revenue acceleration. So in conclusion today, again Q4 again kind of finishing in line with expectations, although revenue and profit growth accelerating quite nicely. 2024 we think quite successful. We grew profits, but importantly, we did simplify and better position the company for the mid-term. Our 2025 macro neutral guidance calls for 11% organic revenue growth, 17% cash EPS growth, both of those consistent with our mid-term targets, although we do expect again our print results to be negatively impacted by macro headwinds. Finally, we do expect some upside in 2025 from our capital allocation and corporate development activities as we work our way through the year. So with that, let me turn the call back over to Tom. He'll provide some additional details on the quarter and on our 2025 guidance. Tom?
Tom Panther: Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. Here are some additional details related to the quarter and the full year. It was a very good quarter with all of our businesses exhibiting strong organic revenue growth. For the quarter, organic revenue grew 12% a smidge under our guide due to gift card shipments falling a bit short of our expectations. From a housekeeping perspective, the net benefit from our December acquisition and divestiture activity was offset by a slight shortfall in gift. Our print revenue of $1,034 million was impacted by approximately $20 million of negative macro compared to our November guide, primarily FX resulting from the stronger dollar post the U.S. presidential election. Normalizing for macro revenue would have been $1,055 million, which is in line with our guide. Digging deeper into our revenue results during the quarter, we were encouraged to see our same-store sales turn 1% positive compared to a 3% drag in Q4 2023. Looking down the P&L, we overcame the stiff macro headwind through strong expense management and a lower tax rate contributing to the $5.36 per share in cash EPS that we are reporting. Cash EPS increased 21% versus last year. Looking at the full year, organic revenue grew 8% and cash EPS grew 12%. Excluding our Russia business, which we sold in 2023, cash EPS increased 16%, despite $65 million of negative revenue macro in 2024. These strong year-over-year results are further reinforced by the healthy consistent sequential quarterly growth in revenue, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, and cash EPS throughout 2024, which positions us well entering 2025. Continuing with our performance highlights, new sales during the quarter and full year were exceptional increasing 36% in Q4 and 22% for the year. For the quarter, Corporate Payments and Vehicle Payments sales increased almost 40% and for the year these two segments grew sales a little over 20%. There is no better testament to the quality and value of our products than to be able to consistently generate sales to new customers. To sum it up, 2024 was a great year as we were able to generate strong top and bottom line growth, increase margins and significantly grow sales. Turning to our segment performance and the underlying drivers of our revenue growth, Corporate Payments revenue was up 26% during the quarter and increased 20% for the year. As expected, some one-time deal related synergies contributed 4 points of growth to the quarter. During the quarter, our direct business grew 28% excluding the one-time synergy led by growth in full AP. Our full suite of high quality payment solutions continue to sell extremely well with sales up 29% this quarter. I want to take a minute to highlight that we won the full AP business of a large global enterprise client that was already using our Vehicle Payments Solutions. This is a terrific example of capturing the overlap in our customer base. In addition, up to now our focus has been selling are full AP solutions to middle market customers, but the addition of this enterprise customer has the potential to unlock additional TAM for us in the Enterprise segment. Lastly, the business' KPI fundamentals remain solid with spend volumes increasing 22% in the quarter and card penetration remaining stable. Cross-Border revenue was up 20% for the quarter and the year, which was led by sales growing 43% for the quarter and 33% for the year. We closed the GPS transaction in December and we continue full steam ahead with those integration plans. The Cross-Border space continues to attract more investor attention and we clearly have a great position in this massive global marketplace. We compete almost exclusively with banks, which control 90%-plus of all international payment flows. We primarily focus on the global middle market where we have better technology, superior sales and customer service, and a proprietary network that allows us to have a very high win rate. We continue to develop new products for our clients and open up new geographies to capture more of the large addressable market. Turning to Vehicle Payments, organic revenue increased 8% during the quarter, which is a 4 point improvement from Q3 and for the year revenue grew 5%. In Brazil, for the quarter, toll tax increased 9% year-over-year with more than a third of our customer revenue coming from extended network. Insurance revenue was up over 130% and we sold nearly 300,000 insurance policies in Q4 alone. We also recently announced signing definitive agreements to acquire Gringo, which is our second deal in the car debt segment. Gringo's super app and national network help consumer and business drivers pay for vehicle taxes, registration and tickets. The car debt market is 3x the size of the toll market and significantly less penetrated, so it gives us enormous runway to grow. The acquisition is expected to close early Q2 and allows us to efficiently use our cash in Brazil in a leveraged neutral manner. We continue to develop and grow our Vehicle Payments strategy in Brazil by selling more tags and providing use cases related to vehicles, all delivered via a comprehensive app. Our strategies and execution are working as evidenced by organic revenue growing 20% for the quarter and 18% for the year. Our brand, sales coverage, and value-added products enable the business to be a meaningful driver of total Vehicle Payments growth going forward. In International Vehicle Payments, revenue grew 12% for the quarter and 11% for the year. This business has been a consistent performer despite some pockets of recent economic softness in Europe. Our consistent strong sales, array of products and channels and geographic diversification drive these consistent results. In the U.S., our digital and field sales efforts are improving as we continue to see growth in applications, approvals and starts. During the quarter sales increased over 60%, which includes significantly expanding our service offering with a large corporate customer. We've now lapped the drag from lower late fees allowing these new sales to flow through into revenue. Lodging organic revenue for the quarter improved to 1% compared to down 5% in Q3. This quarter benefited from an improvement in same-store sales in our workforce business, a trend we expect to continue throughout 2025. During the quarter, room nights increased 23% led by the workforce business, which was particularly active in response to Hurricanes Helene and Milton. Certainly, a significant topic of interest is the impact to our business from the California wildfires that began in early January. We are supporting the FEMA activation in our workforce business and the needs of displaced policy holders through our insurance business. In January alone, we provided approximately 42,000 rooms to emergency workers and displaced home owners. It’s too soon to estimate the impact this catastrophe may have on 2025's results; however, we are focused on making sure our network is able to support the recovery efforts and we extend our support to all of those impacted by this tragic event. In summary, we're super pleased with the performance of our business in 2024. Earlier in the year, we called out our problem children, Lodging and Vehicle Payments, and those businesses are continuing to improve. Meanwhile, our Corporate Payments, Cross-Border, Brazil, and International Vehicle Payments businesses performed exceptionally well which demonstrates our durable earnings growth and cash flow generation. Now looking further down the income statement. Fourth quarter operating expenses of $546 million increased 6% versus Q4 of last year. There were a handful of unusual items recognized in the quarter that essentially net out against each other that I'll quickly tick through. First, during the quarter, we recognized a $120 million pre-tax gain on the sale of our Merchant Solutions business. Second, in connection with our annual goodwill impairment analysis, as required under GAAP, we recorded a $90 million non-cash impairment charge related to the Paycard business, which is part of the Other segment. Third, we recognized $11 million in deal termination fees, and finally, we recorded a $10 million one-time stock comp charge. Note that the after-tax impacts of all of these unusual items are excluded from cash EPS. In addition to these unusual items, this year's acquisitions and divestiture added approximately $30 million of net new operating expense in the quarter. Excluding the unusual items and M&A activity and after normalizing for lower FX rates, operating expenses increased approximately 5% versus Q4 of last year. The increase was driven by higher transaction and sales activities to drive future growth. Bad debt expense was flat versus last year at $22 million, or 4 basis points of spend. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter was 55.2%, up 100 basis points, compared to Q4 2023. On a full year basis, adjusted EBITDA margin increased 120 basis points, excluding our Russia business. Despite the adverse macro environment, we were able to generate significant positive operating leverage driven by solid revenue growth, disciplined expense management, and synergies realized from acquisitions. Interest expense this quarter increased 3% year-over-year, due to higher balances related to capital deployed during the year, partially offset by lower interest rates. Our reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 36.4%. The effective tax rate is approximately 15% higher due to the aforementioned goodwill impairment and sale of our Merchant Solutions business, as well as a non-cash discrete tax provision related to a prior tax planning strategy. Normalizing for these items, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21% versus 23% in Q4 of last year, with the decline driven primarily by stock option exercises and tax planning strategies. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended 2024 with the balance sheet in excellent shape, and a leverage ratio at 2.75x, which is flat sequentially despite the acquisition of GPS in December. In January, we expanded our securitization facility to $1.8 billion and extended the maturity by three years, with slightly better pricing. We are also in the process of raising another $500 million of Term Loan B debt, which we are structuring to be interest expense and leverage neutral by using the proceeds to pay down the revolver. Our capital allocation in 2024 was once again balanced, and we deployed $2.6 billion during the year, which is comprised of $1.3 billion for the repurchase of 4.2 million shares, and $1.3 billion related to acquisitions; improving our position in Payables, Cross-Border, and Brazil. Looking forward into 2025, our first priority remains M&A, and the M&A pipeline is robust. We'll look to acquire businesses that deepen our position in our three core operating segments, with a particular focus on Corporate Payments. We have nearly $1.3 billion authorized for share repurchases, which provides ample capacity to repurchase shares. Now let me share some additional information on our 2025 full year and Q1 outlook. We established the fuel, FX, and interest rate macro assumptions based on the respective forward curves when previewing our 2025 earnings on our November earnings call. The January forward curves have significantly worsened since that call. Specifically, fuel prices are approximately 8% lower, interest rates are approximately 25% higher, and the U.S. dollar is significantly higher, as evidenced by the Brazil FX rate being 10% lower. To help gauge the magnitude of these recent moves, if the macro ends up being consistent with the October forward curves, annual revenue would increase $136 million and cash EPS would increase $1.19 per share. While the current lower macro assumptions may be transient as markets adjust to the policies of incoming government administrations in the U.S. and internationally, we maintained our process for estimating the macro by using the January forward curves. Consequently, our outlook in 2025 projects both print and organic revenue growth of 10% to 12%. We're estimating cash EPS to also grow 10% to 12%, which is $21 per share at the mid-point. Normalizing both revenue and cash EPS for the macro headwind I just described, we'd be at our November preview. So to sum up, the only thing that has changed since our last call is that the macro has gotten significantly worse. But on a positive note, our confidence around our core business performance has increased which is why we are maintaining our initial financial estimates, excluding the macro. Below EBITDA, we're expecting net interest expense to be between $350 million and $380 million, the tax rate to be between 25.5% and 26.5%, and weighted average shares to be flat year-over-year. Related to capital allocation, our forecast assumes that approximately $1.5 billion of free cash flow is used to pay down debt, which provides some earnings upside opportunity should we deploy capital for M&A or buybacks. From a segment perspective, we are expecting the following revenue growth rates: Corporate Payments high-20s print and high-teens organic, Vehicle Payments low-single-digits print and high-single-digits organic, Lodging low-single-digits print and organic. Related to the first quarter, we expect print revenue to grow 7% to 9%, organic revenue to grow 8% to 10%, and cash EPS to increase 9% to 11%. On a constant year-over-year macro basis, revenue is growing 13% and cash EPS is increasing 17%, at the mid-point, compared to the first quarter of last year. We're projecting revenue growth to increase in the remaining quarters as we execute our business plans and lap the higher FX rates from the first half of last year. In addition, first quarter revenue growth is impacted by a tough comp. related to last year's Gift revenue. I'll also note that the volatility in FX rates so far this year creates some uncertainty regarding the ultimate macro for the quarter. We provided additional details regarding our full year and first quarter outlook in our press release and earnings supplement. So now operator, we'd like to open the lines for questions. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Our first question comes to the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Tien-Tsin Huang: Hey, thanks a lot, good to hear, and I'll say up front, Tom, all the best on the transition to your next role here. On the -- on my questions, it sounds like not a lot of surprise organically, really just gift, a little bit of a push-out if I heard that correctly. But across the segments in 2025, it looks like you're looking for a nice acceleration in Vehicle Payments to the high-single-digits from the mid-single-digits in 2024. So what's driving that? How much visibility do you have? I know sales has been good, but just hoping you could break that down for us a little bit. Thanks.
Ron Clarke: Hey, Tien-Tsin Huang, good to hear your voice. Yes, you got it right. The guide assumes high-single-digits and it's really two things. One, Brazil still super strong, and two, we kind of turned the corner on the U.S. Vehicle Payments, so that's gotten a smidge better. So it inches up over last year.
Tien-Tsin Huang: Okay. Good. Good to know. And then, really quickly on Gringo, interesting deal triples your TAM, as you said. What more can you tell us about the financial profile of this business? I think you talked about a 30% grower on the release, but any other details you can share here?
Ron Clarke: Yes, it's a decent size. If you combine it Tien-Tsin, which we will with the think all that pay from last year, together, the revenue will be a little over 10% of Brazil in total, obviously growing much faster. So that's point one. Point two, the exciting thing is both the growth rate and the early days, I think it's 5%, 7% penetration rate of people digitally basically updating registrations to paying for fines. So the runway is super early innings. So the size of it, the early innings to the decent businesses, if you will trying to do the thing. And then the last one is there's 5 million active users per month. So the ability to kind of show them the rest of our stuff is super exciting. So it's -- we think a big upside to Brazil.
Tien-Tsin Huang: No. Sounds like a good fit. No. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes to the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please proceed.
Sanjay Sakhrani: Thank you. Maybe just to follow-up on Tien-Tsin line of questioning. Appreciate like the macro is sort of weighing against the results, but maybe we could just talk about what could drive the upside from here. I know you guys mentioned buyback M&A, but is Gringo in the guide now for 2025 and just any contributions from some of these priorities or initiatives that you mentioned, Ron?
Ron Clarke: Yes, Sanjay, hey, so no, no is the answer to Gringo. It's not closed, so it's not in, in the numbers yet. So I think you're right. I think the upside here would either be the macro pivots again like it did in the last 60 days for your second point of capital allocation. So the guide we have assumed is really just paying down debt, which we ultimately don't do that. So I'd say those would be the three things adding Gringo, the macro pivoting back a bit our way and us using capital to buy earnings or stock.
Tom Panther: And one thing I'd also add is we've been conservative on the same-store sales assumption I think I just assuming that is flat. So the other reason why the dollar is so high and inflation is sticky as the economy has been strong. So that's also something that if we saw same-store sales in the low-single-digits like we did here in Q4, maybe that's additional upside as well.
Sanjay Sakhrani: Great. And then, just a follow-up, maybe on Corporate Payments. I know Ron, you talked about there's still some work to be done in terms of pruning. Maybe we could talk about like sort of where that would might occur, how that could impact the business? And then these initiatives seem really exciting, especially the Multi-Currency Account product. I'm just curious like when does it fully scale to a run rate that's material. Thank you.
Ron Clarke: Yes. On the pruning question, that's not shockingly would be small or non-core assets that don't fit in Corporate Payments. So I don't want to call them out, Sanjay, scoop folks, but we have two or three assets that we're looking at that may go. Yes and the second thing is the priorities to things that we're on are super exciting. We're in line with that MCA Multi-Currency Account product. We've got it across a bunch of currencies and stuff now and we're selling it. So I think as we get through this year, I mean, yes, it could be a big deal, not only in terms of revenue acceleration, right, as we'll learn flow on the deposits. But again, I think it could attract different kinds of clients. So for example, like institutional clients, right, that in the last large amounts of money around operating funds, for example, internationally. So not only is it good to me to go back to our base selectively, but I think it opens up some latent statement that we haven't done one with so far, so pretty exciting.
Sanjay Sakhrani: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Schmidt with Citi Global Markets. Please proceed.
Andrew Schmidt: Hey, Ron. Hey, Tom. Thanks for having me on the call here. Great to see the sales momentum. I was wondering if you're seeing any benefit from some of the sales changes you've made the reorg, the rebranding, obviously hiring a CRO. Those things are relatively recent. But has there been any benefit there? Or is it sort of existing business momentum that's driving things and more to come? I know you mentioned doubling down in the U.S. that seems additive. But just curious on the sales initiatives. Thanks so much.
Ron Clarke: Yes. Hey, that's a good question. I'd like to give credit, but I would say no. I would say it's still early days. The contribution so far from our new guy has really been the team and staffing. He's already brought across three to four, I think, kind of pros that manage kind of zoom sales and seals and rev of and stuff. So who goes really to upgrading, I think, our staff. The big acceleration, the 36% number actually was kind of -- normally, we target kind of 20%, the budget probably for the quarter was 20%. We actually had three elephant sales that happened in Q4 that you can tell were quite significant. One of them I called out in my script was in the Payables business. We contracted. We signed our first enterprise payables account, which was a pretty big deal in sale. I was kidding before we get on to tell people that, that single new account will have spend equal to the size of our entire Paymerang business that we paid $400 million or $500 million for us. So some of the elephants that we got in the quarter was quite big.
Andrew Schmidt: No, that's great to hear. Maybe I could double-click on that. The Payables Enterprise win, to go after that enterprise TAM, are there product adjustments or go-to-market motions that, that need to be updated, maybe walk us through if there are things that need to happen to access that TAM, I know sometimes capabilities can differ between different sized clients. I'm just curious there. Thanks a lot.
Ron Clarke: Super good question, too. So kind of a two-part answer on the product or platform side, though, we're kind of okay. The product and capability we have a work side for enterprise. On the go-to-market, the market motion, yes, we're going to rely on some kind of big partners think like SI, some big consultant firms, to walk us into kind of the senior management in some of those enterprise accounts, which is how we basically got this initial one contracted. So yes, we've got a couple of relationships that are making introductions now into these super-duper big accounts that us coming in saying that we've got a solution ready to go.
Andrew Schmidt: Got it. Thanks so much, Ron.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with William Blair. Please proceed.
Andrew Jeffrey: Hi, good afternoon, guys. Appreciate taking the questions. Ron, a couple of questions actually on Corporate Payments. First of all, can you talk a little bit about sort of your view of Corpay's right to win among enterprise customers? I understand the deal you signed this quarter was with an existing customer. And sort of just from a go-to-market competitive, you mentioned banks and economic standpoint. Can you frame up for us what further wins and/or investments in that business might mean for the long-term growth trajectory of Corporate Payments top and bottom line?
Ron Clarke: Yes, it's also a good question. I mean, the TAM is crazy to size, right? When I quoted to you that this single new enterprise contract has a spend profile equal to a business that took 20 years to build and has, I think, 1,500 customers. So a handful of these super giant enterprise accounts would be crazy. The one thing really comes from, I think a couple of things that we're advantaged one again is the tech, right, that we built really an advantaged way to pay all these different modalities. And then, second is really, again, the virtual card network that, that monetizes it creates money, right, for both sides here. So we're just way ahead because we've been at it a long time in terms of the size and the quality of that network and we can basically promise, if you will, these prospects that we can monetize more of their spend than other people can. And so when you've got tech that works and you've got an economic advantage. And then, last year, remember, we have dedicated people just selling this. I think to focus, as you know, on lending and treasury and stuff. And so having grown up senior people that can go in and articulate why as I'd say, would be the third plant. So a big advantage, yes.
Andrew Jeffrey: Okay. Look forward to learning more about that. And then, could you give us an update, and I apologize if I missed it, Tom, has said it. As to what portion of the full stack AP business is card attached today? And maybe talk about plans to monetize ACH and maybe those plans are even more pronounced now as you move up market in enterprise customers. Just thinking about longer-term, how that business monetizes even better than it is today.
Tom Panther: Andrew, if we caught the question right, we've got a little bit -- you skipped out a little bit. I think you're asking about what the penetration level within the full car penetration level within full IP?
Andrew Jeffrey: Yes, exactly.
Tom Panther: So it is stay consistent right around that 10%, 11%.
Andrew Jeffrey: Okay.
Tom Panther: The average is a high degree of variability. Averages sometimes be dangerous when there's a fair amount of variability. There's some customers that is 2 to 3x that and then there's other customers that are smaller than that just depends on the nature of their AP and how it aligns with our merchant network. But on average, it's right around that 10%, 11% range and has stayed steady.
Andrew Jeffrey: And just from a monetization standpoint and we could talk about off-line, too, if it's more appropriate just trying to understand how you monetize better going forward around non-card in particular?
Ron Clarke: Yes. I mean the good news on that one is there's a model, right, of getting paid right or ACH or ACH+, where we share more data or actually moved -- move money more quickly and same on the subscription side, our product is pretty good now as we've had for a couple of years ago, Corpay Complete. And so having software that actually is helpful, particularly in the front end, right, of automating the process like getting approvals and digitizing invoice. They don't get lost. A lot of that workflow value basically, we don't get paid for it. So we're testing our way into getting paid more for both of those things. Both of those things obviously have value to clients and we've historically done very well at penetrating. So we've got plenty of money. But I think you'll see us do more of that.
Andrew Jeffrey: Thank you. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.
Darrin Peller: Hey guys, thanks. Maybe just on the -- I want to follow-up on another question on the corporate gaming side for a minute, just because this is a big contributor. Number one, I mean, I know it was asked about divestitures before, but in terms of having the right mix of assets, Ron, number one, are you where you want to be? And then, number two, maybe just give us a little more granularity on what you expect the building blocks to this strong growth rate to be for the year. When you think of whether it's the AP businesses or the Cross-Border businesses or the T&E, et cetera. Help us understand a little more of a sort of sub segment level expectation and where you see yourself winning most in that segment if we could start there?
Ron Clarke: Yes. Hey Darrin, so kind of on the two-part question, are they the mix of assets, I think I said to you that we're kind of there. I'd say the one thing that we called out today is this MCA, this Multi-Currency Account product in Cross-Border. I mean, simplistically, that business has been a disbursement business, right? We moved client funds right to benefit share. So this idea effectively depositing and holding in the native currencies, deposits is an advantage based on the better product right for clients, you don't have to go to Germany and open up some local bank account, we can just hold the currency for you, right, in the market that you're in. So I think that, that would be kind of the only significant product at that, that, that we're looking to. On the outlook of the business, again, we had obviously crazy good Q4. We're guiding that thing again to high-teens, approaching 20% again here in 2025. I'd say both businesses are in that neighborhood. It's not like, one of them is carrying. Others, I'd say they're the pretty similar in terms of the growth rate. And the great news in the thing is it's not hard to model for us is, we sold a lot of the business already back in 2024 it's going to get implemented in 2025. And so the visibility that we have in the forward roadmap business is pretty good. And then b) the retention rate, as you know, in that business are a bit above our 92% line average or probably in the 95% kind of retention rate. So look, it's a pretty predictable business. And thinking -- I think I said this to you privately, like, there's just so many prospects like we've got a $600 million U.S. Payables business with 5,000 mid-market clients. There's 250,000 in our sales prospect database. So like the opportunity to make the business 2x, 3x, 4x bigger, that's what we're chasing.
Tom Panther: And Darrin, just to add, there's nothing in the pruning or divestiture category that's in the Corporate Payment space. I think maybe Andrew also had similar questions. So we just want to make sure there's no confusion there. The comments Ron made, were very good, [indiscernible].
Darrin Peller: Makes sense. All right. And just my quick follow-up would just be on margins for a minute. When considering just the U.S. sales effort and the build-out on the investments, I mean, is there any implication about limiting margin expansion? Maybe just give us a little color on what you're expecting for EBITDA margins over the next year or two to then as you build that in.
Ron Clarke: Let me start and then Tom can jump on. So we're kind of planning relatively flat in 2025 on a print basis. And a little bit of that is the macro compression, right, the currency taking $100 million of revenue low kind of processing. Two, is we're absorbing two pretty big acquisitions that have lower, certainly lower than our line average, which means our core business outside of those is actually coming a little bit better. And then, third, we -- I -- we just decided to spend a bit more money on sales and marketing to try to make sure we can get the growth, we can get the sales, which we're planning to be up another 20% this year. So we just felt that it was the best balance. I mean if you were me dare to go to a macro neutral where the world is the same at 2025 and 2024. The print that we're sharing is 13 to 17 -- 13 and 17. So it does get lost a little bit with this wave of crummy macro but kind of underneath is the headline is the business is just performing and outlooking to perform pretty well.
Tom Panther: I think the only thing I would add to that is what we see is the quarterly acceleration of the margin. Some of that is as we lap some of the negative macro that Ron referred to, it's also as we start to harvest some of the synergies from the two acquisitions, particularly GPS in late 2024. And as we also see some acceleration as Lodging and Vehicle Payments start to get further into the black. So all of those things kind of give us accelerating margins to 2025 based on our projection.
Darrin Peller: Fair enough, Tom. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Koning with Baird. Please proceed.
David Koning: Yes. Hey, guys. First of all, just a question on the Lodging business. I was just looking at yields. The last seven quarters, the yields have kind of been in the $13 to $15 per room night. In this quarter, it was $11.40. And I'm sure it has to do with the mix, but maybe describe that a little bit and then how you kind of see the mix in the yield into 2025.
Ron Clarke: Dave, you hit it. I mentioned in my prepared remarks in terms of the impact of Hurricane Helene and Milton that draws a fair amount of what we call FEMA activation business, which is at a very low spread for us. And so that's what drove the overall yield down. We'll see a little bit of yield compression as we now support the California wildfires. The hurricane support has actually declined quite a bit here in January. But that's being replaced and then some by the California wildfire support. But within the FEMA activation as well as within the insurance business, the interest business has a bit higher take rate and so the overall impact may not be as high. It wasn’t as much insurance business associated with the hurricanes. It's more of the payment piece. But it's mix is, as you said, I can going forward with that normalizes out, I think you see a back to the line average of what you saw in the first three quarters of 2024.
David Koning: Yes. Okay. Thanks. And just a quick follow-up. I know you mentioned some kind of one-off benefits in Corporate that helped to drive the 26%, but maybe bridge kind of from 26% in Q4 down to high-teens in the next few quarters.
Ron Clarke: Yes, Dave, hey, it's Ron. So it's really two things. I think of that as kind of a normalized high-teens, 20% business. The two happies in the 2026 was a big kind of one-time synergy, piece of revenue that we negotiated and the second was the channel the comp in the prior year in the infamous channel business that was always detractor turn quite positive. We -- I think we said that we are going to turn the channel business and in fact, we did. So those two things accounted for the vast majority of the list above 20%.
David Koning: Got you. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Please proceed.
Ramsey El-Assal: Hi guys, thanks for taking my question this evening. I wanted to also ask about Lodging and the -- which is recovering nicely. The 2025 expectations are still below the longer-term segment kind of growth profile and trend. I'm just wondering if we should expect that Lodging business to revert over time back up to the normalized historical growth rate. Or has there anything changed in that business in terms of mix or growth algorithm, which might cause it to grow slower than historical precedent?
Ron Clarke: Yes. Hey Ramsey, that is a good question. So the first thing is just how the Lodging business kind of get bad. So let me just start here at bad basically via same-store sales. We had a swath of clients basically kind of use us a lot less. And so it took that volume and revenue out and stuff. And second, what it did is it drew a bunch of our sales people effectively to run over and try to resell and help those clients and stuff. And so that's the problem to say. The recovery in both Q4 and our guide is the same-store sales has basically flat. It was kind of minus 10% in Q4 of 2023, and it's gotten basically back to flat in Q4 of 2024. So as we thought, as I had hoped, it was transient with a swath declines. And so now we're back into, okay, let's zoom bar right, let's get the salespeople back getting new clients and building volume at the top of the funnel. So that's the assignment. So assuming we don't have another fire drill for same-store sales and the salespeople could take this very useful valuable offer we have out, we would expect acceleration as we run through at 2025. And I said it before, it may be the single best offer we have in the company like four of these workforce people. It's just a killer offer of stay anywhere in the hotels that want to stay at 25% off the lowest available price, don't worry about how your people pay for it will handle the employee, the traveler paying and give it back to you, we'll pour on it, reconcile it all like it's an incredible service, you need service that's less than free to companies. And so I continue to believe if we go tell new businesses that they'll take the service.
Ramsey El-Assal: Super helpful. Thanks, Ron. And a follow-up for me on the expanding payables business into Europe. Similar question as one before about moving into enterprise with Corporate Payments. What do you need to do there? I know you've got assets in Europe do you have to hire? Do you have to build that technology? Can you cross-sell to existing customers? Just a little more color on the build-out to get that product overseas. Thanks.
Ron Clarke: Well, another good question. This is super exciting, right? We're trying to take one of our go-forward businesses and get it beyond the USA. And so logically for us, the UK and Europe is a place to go because we have assets there. So the good news is the new cloud tech, front-end tech that we've created for payables works already. It works. We actually have some clients already on the platform in the UK. So the major piece of product work we're doing is we're connecting that to our Cross-Border product because we want -- I want to make sure we could offer disbursements that are -- they're obviously Cross-Border as well as in-country because way higher percent of business is there, right, move money across borders. And so that's kind of the product is take a product we have that works and attach really our Cross-Border to it. So the real-time is the go-to-market. So we're going to use the combination of our clients and some of our people there and stand up a team of specialists to go take this product just like we hear in the U.S. to the clients there. So I'd say by the turn, Ramsey, this summer, we'll have some feedback on whether we can make a business go -- a Payables business go in the UK, like we had here in the U.S.
Ramsey El-Assal: Thanks so much, and best of luck to you, Tom. Nice working with you.
Tom Panther: Thanks, Ramsey.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nate Svensson with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Nate Svensson: Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. A few questions on Lodging. So I figured I'd ask about the other problem trials for North American fleet. I know the last quarter; we talked about that business returning to positive growth this year. And Ron, I think earlier on the call; you mentioned that U.S. Vehicle Payments has started the corner or started to turn the corner. I guess the other thing that set out with that U.S. sales number in Vehicle Payments, which I think was 60% in 4Q. But I guess, just taking that all together, hoping for an update on your thoughts and visibility on that business as we sit here in February for the rest of the year.
Ron Clarke: Yes. Hey Nate, thanks for bringing up the second problem child. Yes. Look, the good news is we're kind of done with the drama that we took you guys through from two years ago, and there will always be. So that's fortunately all behind us. And so the assign that at this point is simple. It's just make sales. The products work well. The clients are happy with improving retention in the business, the credit is in control. So it's as simple as, okay, we're at the baseline. And so the guide that we have, if you look at it quarterly, sequentially has that business ticking up, I think on in front of me, it's exiting at 5% or 6% in Q4 of this year in 2025. And so the single question to ask is just, okay, Ron, how are you adding sales and starts as you run through the quarters? And the answer is, if we do, which is why I hired a guy that knows how to make sales to oversee this, if we do, that business will recover because we'll have dramatically more sales and losses. And so the good news is the assignment is like simple, straightforward, clear, now we need to just go execute it.
Nate Svensson: Got it. That's very helpful. I know there was a question earlier about Gringo. I think that's an interesting acquisition. So I don't want to ask about that again. But maybe I can use that topic to segue maybe a broader update on the consumer vehicle opportunity that we've talked about. Obviously, you've got a ton of things going on in the business these days, but I still think that consumer would be of an opportunity is an exciting one. So maybe update on how things are going in the UK with pay-by-phone and maybe with the road map for that sort of new business opportunity looks like from here for expansion in the UK and the U.S.
Ron Clarke: That's a good follow-up. So I think it's probably pretty consistent with what we reported 90 days ago, which is Brazil is just doing crazy, great. Like if you look at our budget for 2025, in Brazil, half of the revenue growth. So if you took the growth from 2024 to 2025 in Brazil in revenue is from non-toll growth. So even though we're planning 9% tag or toll volume growth, the driver of that thing being high-teens half now of that Gringo growth is non-kind of core product toll. It's the other product. So then we add these assets that effectively double the number of users, customers that can use the full suite of stuff. I'd say my report would be is better dramatically better than we thought it could go. Counter that the UK, I'd say, is still slow and super early days. The tech build took us longer. And simplistically, if you think about it, what we needed to do there is take the pay-by-phone, 2 million digital users and get that app connected to the various networks. So like the fuel network, the EV network, et cetera, the maintenance network, the registration network. So we spent an awful lot of time in the kitchen, making the product work so that when we went out to the pay-by-phone users, we actually had a product that, that actually did a bunch of stuff. And so that’s not a ton to report on the market side. So I'd say same thing, give us, call it, till the term this summer, and we'll have a better fix on whether there's a take. Again, we have great results in one place. It makes us believe we could get them in the second place, but we don't have them yet.
Tom Panther: And maybe want to add on Gringo that I thought after Ron to answer that initial question. Question about price was an ask, but we're going to disclose that in our 10-K, so mine will just kind of comment on it here. We paid around US$140 million, which is a little less than 4x forward revenue, which we think is pretty attractive. But it was all in Brazilian -- essentially almost all in Brazilian currency, which we had in market as a really efficient way, particularly with the currency depressed for us to use that cash down there rather than bring it back and it gets evaporated on it just because of the decline in overall FX rates. From that standpoint, it was something that we thought was pretty attractive. I want just the business purpose and strategy that, that Ron described, but also the price of the transaction and the efficient use of our free cash flow down there.
Nate Svensson: Thanks for the color, guys. Best of luck, Tom. We’ll miss you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Bauch with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
Andrew Bauch: Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. I know that you've called out and you made very clear the macro impacts to the EPS number. But maybe if we can kind of just separate fuel and FX rates, things like business activity confidence amongst your client base bookings, how would you characterize what you're seeing today, what you saw in the fourth quarter because there's various data points that suggest optimism is picking up. And I'm just wondering how that could kind of translate to your outlook?
Ron Clarke: Yes. Hey Andrew, so we get at that and think about that through the trends that we call out. So I don't want you or others to miss that. The best news in Q4 was really the improving trend sequentially, right, that, that organic revenue got backed up right to 12% in same-store sales and health of our clients turned positive, right, at plus 1% sales growth was -- in sales production was record. We've never sold as much in the quarter as we sold in Q4 and retention stage. So that's the math of the business. Like this isn't a very complicated business. If you sell a lot and you keep a lot and your clients stay healthy, you grow. And so the headline to you guys is that's what's spilling into running here into 2025, which allows us -- we took our organic growth consolidated to 11% at the at the mid-point because we think we've got decent visibility into those trends. And effectively, the macro, like how real or the pound converts it's kind of, in some ways, for us, it's just an after we look at what the numbers are and we were on the conversion. So you put that together with just the amount of sales that we have in 2024 of which we get more than half of the benefit from those in 2025, you've got half of your growth effectively already there, kind of already happening, exiting and filling into 2025. So look, things could happen, but I'd say our confidence in the basic businesses is pretty high.
Tom Panther: Yes. One of the things, Andrew, just to be careful of, when we talk about macro and negative macro, it's a very narrow definition of macro. We're not talking about the broader economy in terms of what we're seeing in terms of spend volume and card activity and things like that. It's really our definition of the macro that we normalize for. And if you dig into it even further, it's FX. And if you double-click into that, it's the Brazilian currency is down 9% year-over-year. So it's not a spillover in terms of business activity that we're seeing out there. It's really just a function of some very kind of unique and isolated things in terms of how we're defining the macro.
Andrew Bauch: Yes. Of course meaning kind of separate the two, just one housekeeping note. The M&A contributions you're calling out in 2025, $131 million in the bridge. If we look back at the deck when we did our M&A call in the summer, I know that you're pointing to $200 million of revenues for GPS and Paymerang. Obviously, I think Paymerang had roughly $25 million, I think; we were calling out for 2024. Just trying to make sure if that $200 million kind of pie in the sky goal is still the right number for those two assets?
Ron Clarke: It is. And I wouldn't say it would be pie in the sky. I'd say it's a number we're going to get. So that is the -- Andrew, is the gross numbers. So if you look at the print this year for those two businesses, they will print over $200 million in revenue. The net against that is we dispose of the business; merchant digit business and we got the benefit of six months of Paymerang in 2024. So really, it's a net number, right, call it, $200 million minus the two things I just named basically takes the thing out of where you said $130 million.
Andrew Bauch: All right. Great. Good luck, Tom. Thank you.
Tom Panther: Thank you, Andrew.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes the allotted time for questions. I would like to turn the floor back over to Jim for closing remarks.
Jim Eglseder: Yes. Hey guys, thanks for your interest. There's still some questions we didn't get to, given the timing, but you know where to find us, let me know, I'll be around tonight. Thanks, guys.
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-11-07 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to today’s Corpay Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this call is being recorded and I will be standing by if you should need any assistance. It is now my pleasure to turn today's call over to Head of Investor Relations, Jim Eglseder. Please go ahead.
Jim Eglseder: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today for our third quarter 2024 earnings call. With me today are Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO; and Tom Panther, our CFO. Following their prepared comments, the operator will announce the queue will open for the Q&A session. Today’s documents, including our earnings release and supplement can be found under the Investor Relations section of our website at corpay.com. Now, throughout this call, we will be covering several non-GAAP financial metrics, including revenues, net income, and net income per diluted share, all on an adjusted basis. We will also be covering organic revenue growth. This metric neutralizes the impact of year-over-year changes in FX rates, fuel prices and fuel spreads. It also includes pro forma results for acquisitions and divestitures or scope changes closed during the two years being compared. None of these measures are calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than other companies. Reconciliations of the historical non-GAAP to the most directly comparable GAAP information can be found in today’s press release and on our website. It’s important to understand that part of our discussion today may include forward-looking statements. These statements reflect the best information we have as of today. All statements about our outlook, new products, and expectations regarding business development and future acquisitions are based on that information. They are not guarantees of future performance, and you should not put undue reliance upon them. We undertake no obligation to update any of these statements. These expected results are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today’s press release on Form 8-K and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. These documents are available on our website and at sec.gov. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron?
Ron Clarke: Okay, Jim. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our Q3 2024 earnings call. Upfront here, I'll plan to cover three subjects. First, provide my take on Q3 results, share our Q4 guidance along with a 2025 preview. Second, I'll discuss our U.S.A. opportunity. and our recent sales reorganization. And then lastly, I'll provide an update on our M&A activities. Okay. Let me begin with our Q3 results, starting with we surpassed $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the very first time. So, quite a big milestone for us. We reported revenue of $1.29 billion, up 7%, excluding Russia and cash EPS of $5, up 14%, excluding Russia. The result is really in line with our expectations, both revenue and earnings finishing on the high side of our guidance range. EBITDA margins in Q3, 54.2%, that's up about 100 basis points sequentially. Our trends in Q3 really quite good. Same-store sales remained essentially flat, and that's consistent with Q2. Retention improved slightly to a bit above 92% for the quarter. That's a return to record levels. Sales are what we call new bookings growth of 14% and inside of that corporate payment sales growth leading the way with a 28% sales growth in the quarter. And payables spend monetization levels remaining steady sequentially. Organic revenue growth, finishing at 6% overall. Again, strong growth in corporate payments, Brazil and international fleet. And a continued drag for North America fleet in lodging. Although lodging did show signs of improvement in the quarter. So, the wrap on Q3, really, no surprises here, lodging a bit better. North America fleet a bit worse. But more importantly, trends, same-store sales, retention, sales and spend monetization, all stable or improving. So, really a good result. Okay. Let me make the turn to Q4 and full year 2024 guidance. So, we're outlooking a very strong Q4 finish. We're expecting organic revenue growth to accelerate to 13% and an early view of our October revenue flash supports this acceleration. Outlook in EBITDA margins of 55.6%, which should be up about another 140 basis points sequentially. Cash EPS of $5.35 at the midpoint, up 21% and hopeful for Q4 sales growth coming in above 20%. So, really firing on all cylinders. A couple additional positives. We expect lodging revenue growth to turn positive here in Q4 and the infamous Corporate Payments channel segment expected to finally grow again here in Q4. So, both of these things support our overall revenue growth acceleration. So, as I said back in August, our expected arrival to a better place is now Q4. For full year 2024, our staying put with $19 of full year cash EPS at the midpoint. That implies 16% year-over-year EPS growth, excluding Russia. So, really in line with our 15% to 20% midterm earnings growth target. Okay. Let me transition to a 2025 preview, obviously, early days, but we think it's setting up quite well. In terms of organic revenue growth, we're out looking 9% to 11% driven by a recovery of our North America fleet in lodging businesses, both moving into positive territory next year. Corporate Payments in Brazil maintaining mid- to high teens growth rates even our gift business outlooking double-digit growth next year. We do expect an incremental 3% of print revenue growth that's above organic from the combination of the two Corporate Payments acquisitions. Planning our 2025 sales growth around 20% next year. That's driven by the demand for our new products, along with incremental investment in sales coverage. So, taken together, we're targeting 2025 cash EPS at a $22 per share ballpark. Still lots to work through a couple of big assumptions behind the 2025 cash EPS will be FX assumptions, particularly the Brazil real, along with the net impact of lower interest rates offset by higher 2025 tax rates. So, look, net-net, we're outlooking a pretty good 2025 setup. Okay. Let me make the turn to our USA sales opportunity, along with the recent decision to reorganize U.S. sales and a point a new CRO. So, recently, our U.S. sales growth has not been as good as our international sales growth and particularly our North America fleet and lodging solutions. We see the U.S. opportunity for all of our lines to be enormous. Take, for example, our payables business, we've got about a 2% or 3% share of the mid-market. Recall that's a business of about $500 million of annualized revenue. And yet there's a couple hundred thousand prospects to convert and we've got 2% to 3%. So, look, a big opportunity. So, to get at this opportunity more urgently, we've taken the following actions. We've established a consolidated U.S. sales organization with the associated marketing and sales support functions reporting into one new CRO exec. His name is Mike Jeffrey. We've rebranded sections of the vehicle, lodging and payables lines of business to Corpay to leverage the brand and we've established a dedicated cross-sell team that will take each of our solutions back to our existing client base to drive sales. So, lots of energy focus and urgency around selling more here in the U.S. Okay. And finally, I'll move to my last subject, which is an M&A update. So, quite busy in 2024 on the M&A front. Four deals finalized, a couple still in the pipeline. So, first, Paymerang, the AP automation company -- we closed that July 1st. Good news. It's tracking closely to our second half plan and we're seeing significant synergies here in Q4. GPS across border business that we signed up this summer, still on track to close at the end of the year. Through Q3, the business is performing at forecast. So good news there. So, we'll be excited to bring that business across. Taken together these two Corporate Payment deals should contribute about $0.50, of cash EPS accretion in 2025. Third is our Zapay Brazil deal, which is a vehicle car debts company helps drivers pay for registration renewals and tickets. We acquired that business in the spring. It gave us an entry to really a new payments TAM, that is 5 times the size of the toll TAM, so pretty big. And the that Zapay business year-to-date, up 45% in revenue. We've also signed up 90,000 Sem Parar toll users to using the Zapay solutions in the first six months. So, a good start. And lastly, the Comdata Merchant Solutions business, it's a POS solutions business for truck stop merchants, it's being sold to a PE-backed company planning that sale to close by year-end. You might recall this divestiture is tied to the strategic review from last spring and then to simplify the company. We do have a couple of active deals now that we're still working and although relatively small, if we do proceed we will close those early next year. So, look, in conclusion, today, Q3, again, results finishing on the high side of our guidance range stable or improving same-store sales, retention and spend monetization trends, outlooking meaningful revenue growth acceleration here in Q4, along with record earnings. Early take on 2025 good outlook in revenue and earnings growth kind of in line with our stated midterm objectives. And lastly, very pleased with our 2024 M&A activity, the two Corporate Payment acquisitions, tracking and the business really just positioned better overall for faster growth. So, with that, let me turn the call over to Tom to provide some additional detail on the quarter. Tom?
Tom Panther: Thanks Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. Here are some additional details related to the quarter. As we announced last week, Q3 revenue was $1.029 billion, which I was pleased to see at the higher end of our guide despite lower fuel prices. Organic revenue grew 6% versus Q3 last year, led by 18% growth in Corporate Payments. Strong expense discipline and another quarter of lower bad debt resulted in EBITDA margin of 54.2%. We generated $355 million of free cash flow, which translates into $5 per share in cash EPS, $0.05 above the midpoint of our guidance, up 11%, versus last year and up 14%, excluding the impact of the sale of our Russia business. Overall, our first $1 billion revenue quarter, reflecting the quality and diversification of our business. Now, turning to our segment performance and the underlying drivers of our organic revenue growth. Corporate Payments revenue was up 18%, driven by 7% growth in spend volume and stable card penetration rates. Strength in our direct business, which grew 21% was again led by strong growth in full AP. We closed the Paymerang deal in July, which contributed $14 million of revenue in the quarter and we continue to migrate the business to our platform. Everything is progressing according to plan, and we expect meaningful synergy contributions beginning in the fourth quarter. From an adjusted EPS perspective, we still expect Paymerang to be EPS neutral in Q4. Cross-border revenue was up 21%, led by 40% sales growth. Both new client acquisition and recurring client transaction activity was robust as our scale, technology, and talent advantages continue to power share gains from legacy financial players. Our previously announced acquisition of GPS Capital Markets continues to progress through the approval process, and we expect it to close in early 2025. Turning to vehicle payments. Organic revenue increased 4% during the quarter. Growth was driven by a 7% increase in transactions and higher revenue per transaction which were both broad-based across all businesses and geographies. Organic revenue growth was again driven by Brazil and international fleet, which both grew double-digits. We're beginning to see some progress related to our sales and marketing investment in our local U.S. fleet business. As a reminder, this customer segment services middle market and SMB field services businesses that used vehicles to deliver their goods and services every day. During the quarter, transactions and spend volume on a constant fuel price basis showed signs of accelerating growth. In addition, we're seeing a quarterly trend of improving performance across same-store sales, new sales, and retention. There's more work to be done to increase sales, but it's encouraging to see some initial progress. In the U.K., we continue to expand the PayByPhone parking app into a multi-point consumer vehicle payment app by leveraging our proprietary networks and partnerships to add relevant products and services. In Q2, we launched the ability to acquire car content insurance when parking and added a search function for nearby fuel stations and EV chargers. We've gone live this quarter with 2 additional services. One, our first vehicle maintenance and repair product for the U.K.'s mandatory annual vehicle inspection service. And secondly, EV charging payments, where app users can directly pay for EV charging from their PayByPhone app. We continue to be quite excited about the future prospects from repurposing our B2B networks and payment solutions to a large consumer segment. In Brazil, business performance was again quite strong with revenue growing 18% and sales increasing 22%. Tag growth was 8% and toll-related revenue grew 20%. We continue to see success not just in selling tags, but also selling additional payment solutions. Both insurance policies sold and car debt payment transactions were up over 100% in the quarter. Additionally, card debt app users and revenue were up over 30% compared to last year. These additional products are quite popular and continue to support our cross-sell success. Lodging revenue decreased 5% and improved 5 points sequentially from Q2. Room nights increased 10%, in part due to an improvement in same-store sales as well as storm-related emergency services. The softness in the business appears to have bottomed, and we're expecting the segment to grow slightly in the fourth quarter. Now, looking further down the income statement. Operating expenses of $561 million represent a 7% increase versus Q3 of last year, driven primarily by acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, operating expenses were flat. Bad debt expense declined 3% from last year to $28 million or 5 basis points of spend. So, credit remains controlled. EBITDA margin in the quarter was 54.2%, the slight year-over-year decline was impacted by acquisitions and divestitures over the last 12 months. Normalizing for these transactions, EBITDA margin increased 77 basis points. Our positive operating leverage is driven by solid revenue growth and disciplined expense management, both of which we're quite good at. Interest expense increased $21 million versus Q3 of 2023, due to higher debt balances from acquisitions and share buybacks. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.9% versus 26.6% last year, quite a bit lower as a result of option exercises during the quarter. Now, turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in unrestricted cash, and we had $800 million available on our revolver. We have $6.2 billion outstanding on our credit facilities, which includes an additional $500 million of Term Loan B we issued in September at substantially similar terms to the existing credit facility. We used the proceeds to pay down the revolver after our purchase of Paymerang on July 1st. As of September 30th, our leverage ratio was 2.82 times trailing 12-month EBITDA. We also took actions in September to reduce our interest expense by entering into an additional $500 million 3.19% fixed rate swap and re-struck our Canadian dollar to USD cross-currency swap at a more favorable rate. The combination of these transactions is expected to reduce interest expense next year by approximately $7 million. We repurchased 300,000 shares in the quarter for $90 million entirely related to employee stock option exercises. We have over $500 million authorized for share repurchases and the Board recently authorized an additional $1 billion of share repurchases, so we now have over $1.5 billion available for buybacks. We will continue to pursue near-term M&A opportunities, and we'll also buy back shares when it makes sense while maintaining our leverage within our target range. Now, let me provide some additional details related to our outlook. For the full year, we are maintaining our cash EPS guide of $19 per share and slightly lowering our revenue guide to $3.995 billion at the midpoint as a result of unfavorable fuel prices and FX rates. We are not flowing through the third quarter B as most of that $4 million of revenue was driven by the timing of customer transactions near quarter end. For the fourth quarter, we are outlooking 13% revenue growth and 21% earnings growth at the midpoint. We expect revenue growth acceleration across each of our segments in the fourth quarter, driven by new sales, strong retention, and the realization of synergies from the Pairing acquisition. So, all-in-all, quite similar to what we expected in August. For more details regarding our fourth quarter and full year outlook, please refer to our earnings release. Thank you for your interest in Corpay. And now operator, we'd like to open the line for questions.
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Shyam [ph] on for Ramsey. Thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering if you could break down the retention by segment? And how much of the retention improvement that you saw, how much of that is from Corporate Payments becoming a larger part of the business versus just improving retention trends throughout the remainder of the business?
Ron Clarke: Yes, Shyam, thanks for the question. Yes, we really don't break the retention down by segment. We've talked generally in terms of how the segments performed relative to the overall line average but Corporate Payments business is much better than the line average in some of the SMB businesses within fleet, vehicle payments are below. I think generally, what we've seen is improving signs of retention on an absolute basis yes, as the mix gets more directed towards those higher retention businesses that are naturally repeat up. But that's going to move at a slow pace, and you haven't seen a dramatic shift in mix just from one quarter to the next. You'd have to look out over a 12-month period before you probably start seeing that have much of an impact. So, I think you can assume or take away the point that the improvement that we saw in retention is just core retention improving within the businesses versus a mix story.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Very helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on -- sorry.
Ron Clarke: Go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: And then just a quick follow-up on lodging for me. I was wondering if you guys could size if FEMA had any contribution to lodging payments in the quarter, given the hurricanes and if you guys are expecting any further tailwind from just extended disaster relief efforts?
Tom Panther: Hey it's Tom. It's a good question. I'd say it's probably about $1 million each for, maybe $1 million above kind of the normalized emergencies we get and maybe $1 million this quarter.
Unidentified Analyst: Very helpful.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Tien-Tsin Huang: Hey, great. Good afternoon. Good to talk to you guys. I just want to ask on new sales, if that's okay. Just a couple of questions there. How did the third quarter come in versus plan? And how quickly can the new sales reorg and CRO here produce results in your mind? Thank you.
Ron Clarke: Good question. So, I'd say Corporate Payments was rocking in Q3, I think I called it out, it was in the high 20s over the prior year. The NAF business was still a bit soft. I think it was 14 in total. The outlook is kind of low to mid-20s for Q4. So, the full year would be around 20% for the full year in the preliminary plan that we built for 2025 kind of did that to be up against 20% next year. The hope is that we're going to get some leverage from this thing, which is why we did it both on the expense side, right, consolidating some of the back office things so we can have more line people right out with customers. And then also the cross-selling, right? It's cheaper to sell things back to clients we have in terms of the contact rate is much better. So, he's a terrific guy. The guy we put in the job ran about half of the field in pay checks. So, a pretty big group. And so look, I'm super bullish both on the structure, the advantages the structure creates -- and then second, just on the guy just a super duper guy. So with the products that we have, the structure now in that guy, I'm hoping that things are going to do better next year.
Tien-Tsin Huang: Okay. No, that's great to hear. And then just my follow-up just thinking about visibility into 2025. I know we're so got certainty on the election, and we'll see what happens with rates here, but double-digit growth at this point? How do you feel about visibility there, Ron versus 90 days ago or even same time this time last year?
Ron Clarke: Yes, I think better, Tien-Tsin, for a couple of reasons. One is that we're outlooking the acceleration right now sitting in this quarter. And I've had a chance to peak in October, right, which supports the port, which is good. So, to sit here today and say, hey, I think organic is going to go from 666 to 13 is the first statement I'd make. And then the second one, I think, is just the mix helps us as we look into next year, I think the confidence is higher because the two problem children and moved to flat or kind of low single-digit and the Corporate Payments in Brazil that are super good mid- to high teens or bigger share side of the business. So, I think the mix, the ratio to get back the line averages better. So, I think it's a business you can plan when we go into next year, we've got 90% of the revenue engine next year. Whatever is 20 years of stats now on retention, same-store sales, I mean, you guys are good at math. So, that helps us basically frame what the revenue is going to be.
Tien-Tsin Huang: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Nate Svensson with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Nate Svensson: Hey guys. Sorry about that. I wanted to ask about North American fleet still remains a little bit of a drag on overall growth. And I know one of the other players in the space recently talked about some macro-driven softness there. So, wondering if you can call out some of the broader trends you're seeing in in that business. I know you mentioned same-store sales flat 3Q, but any call-outs you have on trends quarter-to-date? And then maybe more importantly, your 2025 outlook calls for North American fleet to return positive growth. So, can you talk about your confidence, maybe follow-up on Tien-Tsin's questions about visibility into that positive inflection sort of beyond the sales work changes that you mentioned?
Ron Clarke: Hey Nate, it's Ron. So on the first one, the same-store sales, we're seeing nothing. So, again, the thing is basically flat sequential and again, it's improved from the couple of previous quarters, point one. Point two, the retention and that business has improved it sequentially and quite a bit from 12 months ago. And so at this point, now that we finally lapped the infamous pivot of two years ago, it's really just a function now of sales, right? The retention levels are good. We're not seeing anything unusual in the same-store sales. And lastly, we're not setting that big target to try to get to our overall number in the 9% to 11% number, we're saying, hey, let's look for that thing be low single digit, better than it was this year, but no work beater. So, we're not trying to plan some crazy amount of sales next year, but we do expect sales to be up. So, we're not seeing many of the same things that the other company called those.
Nate Svensson: Got it. That's helpful. And then another question with regard to the 2025 outlook. I think you mentioned a couple of the key assumptions being the net impact of lower interest rates and higher taxes. So, hoping you could drill down into each of those a little more? So, on interest rates, obviously -- lower interest rate impact to interest expense. But I wanted to ask about the impact of flow revenue, particularly within Corporate Payments. I know it's not something you manage the business for probably spend two seconds thinking about it. But it's obviously been a little bit of a tailwind to growth there. year-to-date. So, how should we weigh sort of lower rates versus maybe higher average cash balances that you hold for clients and anything else we could be with aware of regards to lapping float revenue? And then on tax rate, I know there's been a lot of talk about Pillar 2 and the impact facing other companies. So, I just wanted to clarify if you had any impact there. And then beyond Pillar 2, any other things we should keep in mind when thinking about the tax rate next year, whether it's impact the share options and back with the election, et cetera?
Tom Panther: That is one loaded--
Ron Clarke: Hold on Nate, let's write that down and move on.
Tom Panther: Let me try to move through each of those quickly to leave some time for another caller. So first on rates, obviously, we had about $3 billion of our debt that's still rate sensitive. So, as the Fed mood continues to cut off, and they cut today and expectation would be to continue to move down, we will get the benefit of that. So, you can against the $3 billion notional. We pencil that out based on what we're seeing in the rate curve is that rates go down average to average, call it, 70 basis points. With respect to float, it doesn't have an overly material impact in terms of the overall impact -- affect our revenue or to our interest income, depending on where the balances are classified and we a little bit of a headwind. But the numbers that we quoted in terms of the overall guide, take that into account in terms of being able to power through any impact from the flow side. With respect to your question on taxes, we do have some exposure to the global minimum tax as that rounded to 2025, it's not overly material. I think what I would say is that this year, we've commented that our tax rate was benefited from some discrete items, namely the exercise of some stock options just by employees given where the stock price has moved over the course of the year, not necessarily counting on that to always continue. And so I think you can look at the tax rate that's closer to our more recent history versus where we were this year where we benefited from outsized employee exercises.
Nate Svensson: Thanks for the color. I appreciate the [indiscernible].
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Dave Koning with Baird. Please go ahead.
Dave Koning: Yes, hey guys. Thanks so much. I guess, first of all, the growth is so good in Q4, and then obviously it's good next year, too. But what's in Q4, the 13% that if we look at next year at 10%, that's not totally sustainable. It seem lodging would probably get better next year, not worse. So, what is going to be different in Q4 than the rest of next year?
Ron Clarke: Yes. Hey Dave, it's Ron. So, the comps would be the main thing. So, let me start with just the acceleration from Q3 to Q4, so kind of $6 million to $13 million. So call that, we report $10 million, $29 million, so call it $25 million, $55 million. Sequentially, we've got three businesses that basically will do way better in Q4 than Q3. So, Brazil because it our corporate Payments Business, partly to the synergies of the latest acquisition or big, and that business is still growing fast. And then our gift business, which is a big seasonal business super active in Q4. So, those three businesses will add $25 million, $30 million incremental. So, I'd say our confidence plus peaking in October is pretty high. So, then when you roll the clock to the next thing, some of those things roll off, right, that Brazil and gift are super powerful in the other quarters, they are big quarters Q4. And again, like last year, with the comps, the gifting got pushed out, I think I mentioned into 2024 or 2023. So, it's really just how things line up against the prior period. But as I said, for the 2025 number $9 million to $11 million, we're just taking the problem children going from negative to low single-digits into the plus column. Corporate Payments in Brazil, mid to high and then kind of international, call it, around 10%. So, when you add those things together, our confidence in that number is pretty high for next year.
Tom Panther: And then also one thing to clarify, the 10% midpoint in that range is exclusive of the Paymerang and the GPS acquisition. So, on a print basis, it would be closer to the 13% that we've referenced.
Dave Koning: Got you. Yes, that makes sense. And -- maybe a quick follow-up. Just corporate mix of growth in volume and yield, yield was super strong this quarter, volume decel. Was that just purely the mix of what was happening?
Tom Panther: Yes. That's exactly right. It's just purely a mix story behind that.
Dave Koning: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead.
Sanjay Sakhrani: Thank you. Ron, and Tom, you guys talked about a pipeline and M&A pipeline. I'm just curious sort of what's in there. I know there's more on the share buyback. But as we think about where you're going to allocate your capital next, I mean, is it M&A more so than buyback given some of the valuations are compressed?
Ron Clarke: Yes. Let me go to the first part of the question, the pipeline. So, I think we said last time, we're focused really on corporate payments, transactions and then the consumer vehicle, things that could help us build bigger volume faster there. So, no shock that the things we're out looking are in that that group. In terms of the split between buybacks and acquisitions, it's always the same, if we have attractive earnings and assets that we can buy create forward growth. That's always our top priority, if the business case turns. And to the extent that -- the stock price rates out of a range that we like, we use liquidity for that. So, I don't think anything materially different in terms of the priority ahead into next year. Although I think the Board did at the last meeting increased the authorization. By another $1 billion. So, we've got liquidity get next year. We've got the authorization, so we'll see where the stock goes.
Sanjay Sakhrani: I guess to follow-up, I know you talked just on that previous question about the acceleration and then the comps and stuff. I guess -- as we think about this acceleration, I mean, you said you peaked into October, it looks good. where is there any risk in the numbers? I mean, it seems like things are progressing quite well. But they're -- you're calling for a pretty decent exception in the fourth quarter. I'm just curious as we look at these, is it just all comps and therefore, you're pretty comfortable because sometimes the comp base isn't more guy there? Just curious.
Ron Clarke: No, it's a good question to say, 13% revenue growth and I think a 21% earnings growth in Q4 is obviously we've arrived. I'd say the biggest risk, we tend to look at the business sequentially would be in that gifting -- last year, we had it in the Q4 number because it's historically been the big quarter. not only to retailers order tons of get cars, but then people activate them like crazy, late in the quarter. So, it's a late game call. And so there's only so much science in that. So, I'd say if we were back on a call in 90 days and we're short in Q4, I would say that would be the most likely answer as to why.
Tom Panther: Sanjay -- what Ron said on the sequential point. So, it's going up $25 million sequentially. We've got -- the gift piece call that [indiscernible]. And then the other pieces are things that we've got a pretty good line of sight into some realization of Paymerang synergies is another piece of that. And then Brazil, given the summer season down there, predict we have high predictability around the sequential increase there from Q3 to Q4. So, I think those give us added confidence that we'll be able to hit the Q4 number.
Ron Clarke: Yes. There are also record numbers, right? There's comps and the growth over the prior year, but it will be record revenue, record earnings, I mean, almost record margins. So, everything I'd say to you guys is pretty positive, separate from having easier comps from last year. Good spot.
Sanjay Sakhrani: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from Peter Christiansen with Citi. Please go ahead.
Peter Christiansen: Good evening. Thanks for the question here. Really nice -- impressive results. Tom, question I was asking initiative in the past -- you have to pick the business out of the micro accounts in between that last effort, just trying to see how you're going about the cross-sell differently this time around and what makes you confident that this a more viable opportunity in 2024?
Ron Clarke: Hey Pete, thanks for reminding me -- [indiscernible], but -- it's a super fair question. I think a few things. Every day, we get a little bit smarter. So, the handful of differences this time around is, first and foremost, the targeting I think I've mentioned that before. We were romanced by the numbers instead of by the targets. And so this time, we're much clearer who among our client base makes sense to bring our other products to. It's a smaller group of larger accounts. That will be the first one. The second, I think, is the brand, bringing products back that share the brand. We've moved a bunch of existing clients, let's say, in the fleet card business, to what we call a Corpay One fleet card. So when you go to them with a Corpay Business card or Corpay AP Automation solution, that's that company Zapay, okay? It's the same thing. And then lastly, I think this dedication of sales people that are just doing this. So, it's not a part-time job, but it's kind of what they do and we are marketing people focused on it. So, I think the whole approach to the thing is just better organized and better set up this time around, you get tired running cycles. And so we should have some pretty decent read over the next three to six months, whether this version is going to be way more successful. It should be.
Peter Christiansen: I appreciate that color. It certainly sounds more encouraging this time around. I did want to ask a little bit about the preview for 2025, super helpful. I appreciate the initial preliminary look there. Just curious on view on margins generally. Obviously, there's going to be a lot of factors that could influence that over the year. But at least from what you're looking at now, do you see that as a component to earnings growth next year? Thank you.
Ron Clarke: Yes, for sure. Again, you get a little bit of noise right from the acquisitions that generally come across as lower margin. But I think the answer is yes. We expect some operating leverage again, role in the next year.
Tom Panther: Pete, you just have the structural advantage of the business where significant amount of fixed cost. And so when you're growing revenue 13% at the midpoint inclusive of acquisitions, you're just going to get positive operating coverage. We've been pleased with the sequential increase of margins quarterly this year, I don't have the numbers in front of me, but like a 51, 52, 54, 55 kind of number. And so I think that -- some of that quarterly variation is seasonal, but exiting at that mid-50s and overall at about 54, for the year, I think, gives us and reason to believe that it will bring paid up next year as well.
Peter Christiansen: That’s really helpful. Thank you, Tom, thank you, Ron. Great results. Thank you.
Ron Clarke: Thanks Pete. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Rufus Hone with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Rufus Hone: Hey guys. Thanks. Sorry, I joined the call a little late, so hopefully it hasn't been asked. But on Corporate Payments, the gross sales performance looks really strong and you noted 40% growth in cross-border I think about the retention there is slightly better than the Corpay average. So, how are you thinking about the organic growth in that segment heading into 2025 with that kind of sales traction, obviously, moving pieces from the acquisitions, but any thoughts there would be great? Thank you.
Ron Clarke: Yes. Rufus, it's Ron. High-teens is what I say we're looking at, you're right, the sales have been literally record levels now for the last two years, and you write the retention in the business is a bit a bit above -- better, I should say, than our line average. And so when you put that math together, you get back to high teens in revenue. And obviously, as to Tom's point, this operating leverage in that business, it runs off of one system. So you're probably in the mid-20s in terms of EBITDA growth in the business. So, it's been compounding at that level for a couple of years now. And then as you recall, that's an interesting area for us in terms of deals. We're going to add, obviously, an asset that we hope to close at the end of the year that there's synergies in and continue to look in that space for other assets. So, we do have the ability to layer additional transactions in that space on our platform.
Rufus Hone: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Jim Eglseder for closing remarks.
Jim Eglseder: Thanks for interest in guys. I know it's a busy night. So, if you anything else, are you working through your model, feel to should be happy to help. But thank you for getting on the call.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-05-09 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day everyone, and welcome to today's Corpay First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, you have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Jim Eglseder. Please go ahead, Sir.
Jim Eglseder: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today for our first quarter 2024 earnings call. With me today are Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO, and Tom Panther, our CFO. Following the prepared comments, the operator will announce that the queue will open for the Q&A session. Today's documents, including our earnings release and supplement, can be found under the Investor Relations section of our website as corpay.com. Throughout this call, we will be covering organic growth. As a reminder, this metric neutralizes the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and spreads, and it also includes pro forma results for acquisitions and divestitures or scope changes closed during the two years being compared. We will also be covering other non-GAAP financial metrics, including revenues, net income and net income per diluted share, all on an adjusted basis. These measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than at other companies. Reconciliations of the historical non-GAAP to the most directly comparable GAAP information can be found in today's press release and on our website. It's important to understand that part of our discussion today may include forward-looking statements. These statements reflect the best information we have as of today, and all statements about our outlook, new products and expectations regarding business development and future acquisitions are based on that information. They are not guarantees of future performance and you should not put undue reliance upon them. We undertake no obligations to update any of these statements. These expected results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on form 8-k and in our annual report on 10-K. These documents are available on our website and at SEC.gov. With that out of the way, I will turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron?
Ron Clarke: Okay Jim, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our Q1 2024 earnings call, our first as Corpay, the corporate payments company. So upfront here, I'll plan to cover three subjects. First, provide my take on Q1 results and share our updated 2024 guidance. Second, I'll cover conclusions from our recent three-year strategy offsite, regarding the way forward for the company, and then lastly, I'll highlight a couple developments since we last spoke. Okay, let me begin with our Q1 results, which finished really right in line with our expectations. We reported revenue of $935 million. That's up 8% excluding Russia and cash EPS of $410 million. That's up 14% excluding Russia. Overall, organic revenue growth 6% for the quarter, although against a pretty tough comp. Pleased with our corporate payments business, revenue growth there up 17% overall, but up 21% if you exclude the channel partners. Trends in Q1 quite good; retention, overall retention remains stable at 91%. Sales or new bookings up 11% year-over-year and same-store sales soft negative 2% for the quarter, driven primarily by lodging, although same-store sales did improve one point sequentially from minus three to minus two this quarter. For sure we're dealing with a couple problem children here in Q1, our North America vehicle business, as you'll recall, making the pivot away from low quality micro accounts to SMB accounts. We are increasing the sales ramp there with incremental digital and a new kind of upmarket field sales channel to drive the pivot, but taking a bit longer than expected, but I do want to say we are for sure making progress. Our workforce lodging business continuing to experience continued softness. That's from a combo of macro weakness and a couple of areas there, along with issues in converting to a new IT system. Fortunately, we've now converted the majority of the client base across to the new IT system, and we've introduced a brand new employee-friendly solution we call Choice, hoping these enhancements will harden the base. Good news, the early look at April volume in lodging does suggest that the softness is stabilizing. We're outlooking both the North America vehicle business and the workforce lodging business to return to positive organic growth in Q4. So look in summary for the quarter, no real surprises and numbers coming in really on expectation. All right, let me make the turn to our updated 2024 full year guidance. Really two major differences today in our outlook for the year versus 90 days ago. So first, FX has moved against us and interest rates look to be holding higher for longer. So both of these macro factors, unfortunately will depress our print rest of year. Additionally, as I said, we're expecting our lodging client softness to hang around longer, thereby reducing our full year lodging revenue forecast. On the good news front, we do have greater visibility now around our high performing businesses, corporate payments, international vehicle and Brazil, and their ability to over deliver rest of year. So as a result of these updated assumptions, we're reducing our full year 2024 revenue guide at the midpoint from $4.80 billion to $4 billion. So down $80 million. That consists of $40 million of lower FX translation and then second $40 million of incremental lodging revenue softness. We're also reducing full year '24 cash EPS at the midpoint from $19.40 to $19. This is 100% the result of the macro. We do plan to absorb the profit impact from the $40 million launching revenue divot through a combination of expense reductions, currency swaps and some tax planning. So despite the bit softer full year outlook, we're still expecting a very strong Q4 exit, with organic revenue there well above 10% and cash EPS above $5. Okay, moving on, let me shift gears and share some of our conclusions from our recent midterm strategy offsite. That's where we lay out plans for the next three years. So first off, in terms of objectives, we aspire to be a top quartile growth company within the S&P 500. We're committed to 10%-plus organic revenue growth and 15% plus earnings growth and that's a pretty small club. Second, deeper, not wider, we've concluded to go deeper in each of our three core segments, vehicle, corporate payments and lodging, and not to expand into new segments, at least for now. Our research across the three core segments confirms that we've got plenty of TAM and plenty of sales expansion opportunity in each major business, such that we can achieve our growth objectives without going wider. Third, in terms of acquisition strategy, our focus will be on corporate payments and consumer vehicle businesses, I think pay by phone. We're going to focus on wheelhouse or accretive deals rather than capability deals that we've executed recently and then lastly, from the offsite, in each of our major businesses, we plan to sell what we call a flagship product most of the time, so that more and more of our scale will be built on a single product in each line of business and then over time, we'd convert existing clients off of other products onto the flagship product. This will result in a narrower set of SKUs over time. So look, we believe that this more focused way forward will result in a much easier company to manage and grow. Okay, lastly, let me make the turn to talk about two recent developments. First, our brand and ticker change. We did make our overall company brand change to Corpay, the corporate payments company, in March, at the same time changing the ticker symbol to CPAY. We are planning to use the Corpay brand as a go-to-market brand, here in the US. We already go to market as Corpay in our corporate payments business. We've now launched the Corpay1 universal fleet card and business card in our vehicle payment segment and we're soon to relaunch CLC as Corpay Lodging. So in this case, we'll have one single Corpay go to market brand across payables, lodging and vehicle. So sure to help us on the cross selling front. Second, acquisitions; we've been pretty active on the acquisition front. We did announce earlier this year that we closed the majority investment in Zapay. That's a vehicle payments business in Brazil with three million monthly active users. You might recall the idea there is to add Zapay's vehicle registration renewals and payments of vehicle tickets or fines to our overall Brazil consumer vehicle bundle. The business is doing great. Zapay revenue grew over 50% in Q1. We did announce earlier today signing Paymerang. That's a full AP corporate payments company, runs about $50 million in annual revenue. We like the deal. It'll strengthen our corporate payments AP automation business and four new verticals. We're expecting the deal to close here in Q2, pending regulatory approval and expected to be accretive to both revenue growth and EPS growth next year. We see lots of synergies to chase. Okay, so in conclusion, Q1 out of the blocks, kind of, kind of per our expectations. Rest of your outlook? Unfortunately, a bit of a mixed bag, now expecting unfavorable macro and lodging softness for longer offset by strong performance in corporate payments, international vehicle and Brazil. We have refined our three year growth plan. It calls for a narrower, simpler company that we can manage and compound. That's got plenty of growth potential. So we like the way forward. Finally, we're excited about these latest acquisitions; Zapay and Paymerang, along with the active pipeline in front of us. We expect these wheelhouse deals to be accretive to 2025 revenue and earnings growth. So with that, let me turn the call back over to Tom to provide some additional detail on the quarter. Tom?
Tom Panther: Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. Here are some additional details related to the quarter. Overall results were in line with our expectations. Print revenue was $935 million, which was consistent with our guide, despite a $7 million macro headwind from both fuel and FX. Organic revenue growth was 6% as 17% growth in corporate payments was partially offset by softness in lodging. Reported revenue growth was 4%, but if you exclude the impact from the sale of our Russia business, revenue growth was 8%. Strong expense discipline and another quarter of lower bad debt, produced positive operating leverage. Combined with a lower tax rate, we delivered $4.10 per share in cash EPS, $0.03 above the midpoint of our guidance, up 8% versus last year and excluding the impact from the sale of our Russia business, cash EPs increased 14%. Now, turning to our segment performance and the underlying drivers of our revenue growth, corporate payments revenue increased 17% during the quarter, within which our direct business grew 27%. Our direct business exhibited strong underlying performance with solid growth across spend volume transactions and customers. In addition, higher revenue per transaction rates further contributed to the revenue growth. Cross border revenue increased 18% and sales grew 25%, despite the low FX volatility during the quarter. Client acquisition and spend volume activity was robust as nearly every geography was up double digits, with particular strength in Asia Pac. We continue to make significant investments in this business through increased sales and marketing resources. Turning to vehicle payments, organic revenue grew 4% during the quarter with the increase driven by Brazil and international fleet. Our international fleet business continues to perform very well, led by double digit revenue growth in Europe, Australia and our maintenance business. In the UK, the soft economy impacted volumes in specific industry sectors, but we're confident that will rebound as economic growth resumes, given our strong market position, which includes 75% of the UK's top 200 fleet companies. During the quarter, we continued to build on our market-leading position in EV with customer accounts nearly doubling, which includes our three in one charge pass product and home charging sales. We're also excited to report that the charge pass product won the innovation in EV Technology Award at the 2024 Great British Fleet Awards, a prestigious and longstanding event across the automotive and fleet community. Our EV success is further reinforced with over 40% of the top 200 fleet companies using our charge pass product. Related to our expansion into the UK consumer vehicles market, we are making progress developing the integrations between our proprietary fuel, EV and vehicle networks, into the pay by phone app. We expect this functionality to be in place by the third quarter of this year. In Brazil, business performance was extremely strong, led by tag growth of 9%, now totalling over seven million tag users. Our B2C extended network revenue was double compared to Q1 of 2023 and now over 30% of total revenue is non-toll. Also, sales growth continued to be strong across the tag and insurance products. In March, we closed on the majority investment of Zapay, which has over three million customers that use the Zapay solution to pay for vehicle registration and compliance fees. The addition of Zapay further advances our consumer vehicle payment strategy in Brazil and allows us to capitalize on the attractive two way cross sell opportunity. We are now beginning to cross sell Zapay solutions to our existing seven million drivers and conversely cross selling our existing suite of vehicle payment products to Zapay's client base. In the US, the impact from our shift away from microclimates continues to impact our sales and revenue results. Our upmarket digital and field sales efforts are improving as we continue to see growth in applications, approvals and starts. As we mentioned last quarter, the shift to higher credit quality clients has impacted late fees, which were down $8 million compared to Q1 of 2023. However, we've seen a $15 million reduction in bad debt expense, yielding a positive earnings trade. Lodging revenue was down 9% against 26% organic growth in Q1 2023, so a pretty tough comp. Recall that last year we had significant high weather driven distressed passenger volume and insurance claims. We continue to see softness in the base, particularly related to smaller field services companies that are deploying fewer workers as a result of the uncertain macro environment. We've recently completed some IT enhancements that will strengthen our value proposition to both existing and new customers, which translated into 16% growth in Q1 sales compared to a year ago. Now, looking further down the income statement, our Q1 operating expenses of $538 million were up 2% versus Q1 of last year. Expense growth from acquisitions and sales investments were offset by lower bad debt expense and the sale of our Russia business. Bad debt expense declined $14 million, or 35% from last year to $25 million, or five basis points of total spend. Substantially all of the decline was in US vehicle payments as we realized the benefit from our lower exposure to US micro clients. EBITDA margin in the quarter was 51.6%, a 53 basis point improvement from the first quarter of last year. The positive operating leverage was driven by solid revenue growth, lower bad debt expense and disciplined expense management. Excluding our Russia business sold in 2023, EBITDA margin increased approximately 160 basis points. Interest expense for the quarter increased $9 million year-over-year due to decline in interest income from the sale of our Russia business and the impact of higher interest rates which were partially offset by lower debt balances. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.7% versus 27.1% last year. The lower tax rate was primarily driven from tax benefits from the exercises of stock options. Now turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in unrestricted cash and we had nearly $1.5 billion available. On our revolver. We have $5.4 billion outstanding on our credit facilities and we had $1.4 billion borrowed under our securitization facility. As of the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was 2.4 x trailing 12 month EBITDA, which is at the lower end of our target range. Our strong liquidity and debt capacity, coupled with our ability to generate over $300 million in quarterly free cash flow, positions us well to actively deploy capital during the year. We have ample capacity to support M&A as well as to continue to buy back our stock. Related to our $800 million buyback program, we announced in February, to date, we've repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares for $700 million. We view $800 million as the floor, not a ceiling, and will continue to evaluate additional buybacks over the course of the year. In addition to Ron's comments regarding guidance, let me provide some additional detail on our full year guidance and some thoughts on our Q2 outlook. For the economic outlook, we are not assuming either a recession or meaningful economic improvement in overall business activity across our markets. We have updated our macro forecast to reflect the latest fuel, FX and interest rate projections. The fuel related macro assumptions are essentially unchanged. However, the higher for longer expectation related interest rates that gained traction in April caused the US dollar to significantly strengthen and the forward curve to increase approximately 90 basis points as of yearend. The impact from FX is approximately a $40 million reduction in revenue and higher interest rates resulting result in an additional $14 million of interest expense. Additionally, we are lowering our revenue guidance $40 million due to the softness in lodging. However, we are executing specific actions to reduce expenses that offset this reduction in revenue, so that it doesn't flow through to earnings. In the supplement, we outline the impact of these changes in the macro and operating performance, to revenue, EBITDA and adjusted EPS. In summary, for the full year, we now expect GAAP revenue growth of 5% to 7% and organic revenue growth of 7% to 9%. EBITDA growth of 7% to 9% as well, with margin expanding 100 basis points and adjusted net income per diluted share growth of 11% to 13%. Excluding the impact from the sale of our Russia business, we're expecting cash EPS growth of 15% to 17%. I'll underscore that these estimates exclude the impact from our pending acquisition of Paymerang. For Q2, we're expecting revenue to grow 1% to 3% on a GAAP basis and 4% to 6% organically and cash EPS to grow 6% to 8%. Excluding the impact of the sale of our Russia business, we're expecting Q2 cash EPS to grow 12% to 14%. This reflects roughly $13 million of expected revenue, macro headwinds from FX and $3 million of additional interest expense versus the outlook we provided in February. Looking forward into the second half of the year, we anticipate revenue and adjusted net income growth to accelerate as we realized the benefits from the implementation of new sales, improved retention in US vehicle payments, and specific business initiatives. The rest of our assumptions can be found in our press release and supplement. Thank you for interest in Corpay and now, operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang, JPMorgan.
Tien-Tsin Huang: Good afternoon, Ron and Tom. I just wanted to ask on the lodging maybe to start with that. I don't think I fully caught some of it was macro and there was an IT cutover, maybe that drove some attrition, but it didn't look like the retention was off either. So I just want to get a little bit more detail and what we might expect in the next two to three quarters before it turns positive again in the fourth.
Ron Clarke: Hey, Tien-Tsin, it's Ron. You mostly got it right. So basically last year we put in an upgraded IT system, kind of the foundation, but waited till this first quarter to try to convert. So it created a few bumps and created a divot with kind of a set of clients, kind of softness with a set of clients. But fortunately from watching it, it hasn't gotten any wider. I think we stuck a page Tom in the document. Page 16 Tien-Tsin in the supplement basically shows the softness is still sitting there in Q1 that we reported but hot off the press in April. It's kind of stabilized. Kind of the business is flattening and so the hope that we have is as we lap the dividend here in Q1 and Q3, that basically again, the retention is good and the new sales are good. Sales actually were up, what, 16% in Q1, that will be on the other side of it. So hopefully it's a blip with a select set of clients that we can get to the other side on.
Tien-Tsin Huang: I see. Okay, so you're basically -- you're rebasing off of the set of clients coming off and you're seeing growth from that. Okay, I think I get it. Thanks for the slide. I missed it. On the Paymerang acquisition, what stood out about this one, Ron? Was it the verticals? Something around the tech specifically? I'm curious what drew you to it.
Ron Clarke: Yeah, The first thing Tien-Tsin is it's the kind of business we like. So inside of corporate payments, our favorite piece of business is what we call full AP, where we take literally 100% of the clients invoices, no matter how we pay them. So we like that the most because it gives us the most control. We have the best retention with it. Clients like it the most. So that's the first one. But yes, the appeal to us that you pick up three or four verticals that we're not in, we have no referenceable clients; one, two vendors that are kind of in those verticals, or three, like ERPs or other partners. So you pick up the, whatever, the 10 years or 15 years that company's been building those up, suddenly we're set up now to go bigger in those spots. And then lastly, obviously, because it's so super adjacent to what we do, the synergies are, as you'd expect, quite significant, really super meaningful to us. So, yes, with the things kind of we get through the first few months here, the model we have is it'll be quite accretive in '25.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.
Sanjay Sakhrani: Ron, could you talk about the North America vehicle business? It sounded like it's performing a little bit weaker than you'd like. Are you guys expecting that to inflect as we move through the year and so what's going to drive that?
Ron Clarke: Yeah. Hey, Sanjay, it's a good question. So I think the story is a little bit old now of whatever. A year and a half ago, we made the pivot. We flushed whatever 40,000 micro accounts that gave us revenue and late fees, but also a ton of bad debt. So as we work that through both, stopping new micro accounts coming in and then second tamping down on terms and credit lines in the first half last year, we were successful in exiting a lot of that business. And so now we have a cleaner business with a steadier kind of 80,000, call it bigger clients that have a steadier latency mix, volume mix, lots of characteristics and stuff and so we're lapping kind of that prior period. So now it's really just the addition of some of the new products there and the new sales snowballing enough to kind of build off of the base and so like every pivot or change in the business, it's gone a bit slower than I would hope, but internally, I've got that thing well into the positive as we exit the year. So as we lap the thing and we head into the back half, into Q4. So I would say that structurally, you get retention benefit. Whenever you have a base and you flush super micro accounts, a lot of them become insolvent. You have a lot of involuntary attrition. So we'll get structural improvement both in base hardness and in retention. So really it's just waiting a couple of these new sales channels to layer on and we like back where we'll be. That's the basic outlook. So a little painful getting here, but we like the way forward.
Tom Panther: Sanjay, just a couple of proof points on that. In the first quarter, we actually saw sales growth up 12%. So that was improved from what we saw on a quarterly basis last year. We've also seen approval rates back to 2021 levels. So we've been doing some things on credit side tuning our models and approval rates are back to where we were prior to the pivot into the digital channel. And on late fees, we've actually seen those bottom out and start to slightly rebound. So I think there's line of sight into the things that caused the drag over the last three or four quarters to be lapping and normalizing.
Ron Clarke: Sanjay just on Tom's comment, the approval rate is up about 50% from September. So we track it monthly. So all the stuff that comes to us. So we're pointing marketing, if you will, at higher quality prospects or better applications now that we can approve. So that makes it an easier business to run.
Sanjay Sakhrani: Okay, great. And just a follow up question on Paymerang, I understand it's sort of full AP automation, but how does it fit into what you have right now? And how long have you guys been looking at this business? And then just final one, Tom, like, are you including the revenues associated with the acquisition? I know, Ron, you mentioned it's probably not going to be accretive until next year, but maybe you could just talk about that too. Thank you.
Ron Clarke: So let me try to take the order of those questions. So how long? I guess we've known the business for a few years, have visited and stuff. And so I've reached out to the principal directly, make this transaction. Second question, is it included? No, we signed, but we haven't closed. So basically when we close, which we expect to be, certainly this quarter, when we talk again in 90 days, we'll roll that in. So call it $25 million to $30 million incremental, assuming we close in the next couple of months. And how it fits is, again, we're in the exact same business. We do exactly the same thing, but we generally do it for different kinds of companies and different verticals and as people pointed out, there's a bit of a breeder react. So once you get into a vertical, your brand becomes known. You have clients in the area, you pay the vendors of those clients. You have ERP and other kinds of partners and so the thing works in a way, basically, where you can build a business better via verticals than you can geographically. So although we do exactly the same things, we don't do those things in those verticals. So effectively we will. We'll use, obviously, a lot of our back office and some of our advantaged contracts and stuff like that and some of our sales techniques to kind of basically build up the business that they have in those verticals and get, obviously a bunch of synergies along the way. So it's a super attractive. It's what we call a wheelhouse deal. We know it super cold. We studied the company well and we're super clear on what we're going to do with.
Tom Panther: It's right in our sweet spot where we're getting both customers, 1,300 customers, and expanding our merchant portfolio by 250,000 merchants. So we've talked a lot about customers and networks as our two competitive moats out there and this is right in that spot where we gain those things with this acquisition and then, as Ron said, we can germinate it from here into something bigger.
Sanjay Sakhrani: I'm sorry, they won't make money until next year. Or do they make money now?
Tom Panther: Yeah, they make money now, but we need them to make a lot more money.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ramsey El Assal with Barclays.
Ramsey El Assal: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question this evening. I wanted to ask again about lodging and just maybe ask you to comment on your visibility in that business right now. April. It was great to see April stabilize. Do you feel like the recovery in lodging is kind of pretty much locked in at this point, or are there still variables that you're having to worry about to kind of get from point A to point B there?
Ron Clarke: Yeah. Hey, Ramsey, it's Ron. It's a good question. So I think locked in is a pretty, pretty strong word. What I'd say is what we can see that's super clear is what caused the divot and the D cell, which is softness. So yet we've got 15,000 clients or something in that business, and a select group of clients went soft on us starting Q2, Q3 last year and so the good news is, other than that select group that went soft, the others didn't. So the other clients didn't go soft, and neither did the retention, did we have any kind of big spike in retention. So, effectively, kind of, once we lapped this select group of clients that went soft, the key to the thing reaccelerating again, is just sales. It's a high retention business generally and so as long as the sales that we have in the plan come to fruition and we get those implemented, then we'll grow basically over that lap base. So, again, a little bit of your seeing of that is we started to catch it a little bit here in April. So we think really the turn in the business would be Q3, where if we said, hey, what's the softest? I think it was still 10%, 11%, 12% in Q1, and we had 2% as a company overall. My estimate would be by Q3, that thing would be close to zero. So the softness would be, if you will, client base would be relatively flat. So, and again, the good news is there's no more IT boogieman. We spent a year and a half, two years building the thing. We converted the base. It's a new great feature, so the product is actually better. So we're going to get the benefits this year forward of the pain, effectively, that we inflicted last year. So that's a positive, that there was some benefit, basically, in the journey on IT.
Tom Panther: And, Ramsey, what I'd add is we've kind of taken this beyond the analytics. We've actually got a very structured campaign where we're calling those customers, talking to them, giving them the value proposition of the improvements that we've made, understanding why they maybe are using us less. We're gaining really good insights into that. So I would agree. Not locked in, but we've taken this beyond the math and are really doing this at a customer level, which has given us a lot of additional insights over the last month or so. That's perfect.
Ramsey El Assal: Thanks. And a quick follow up from me. I noticed that the stock repurchases seem to accelerate in the last 30 days, meaning you did more repurchases in the last month than you did in the entire first quarter. Should we expect you to kind of lean more aggressively into buybacks when it comes to capital deployment. Not entirely a fair question, because you're also announcing deals that you're doing. So I'm just curious if you can comment on the balance there and what we should expect.
Tom Panther: Yeah, I'll random Tom. And so I think it's kind of comparing a little bit of an apple and an orange there, because in the first quarter was really just the month of March was when we got started in terms of the buybacks. We waited until we got our K filed and started the buybacks. You're really only seeing one month in the month of March and then basically, obviously the month of April. So they're fairly evenly split across that 700 in terms of how that played out in the period. We did a 10b5-1 plan so that we could continue to be in the market during the blackout period. So nothing there other than just timing. We were pretty much evenly in the market over those 60 days, if you will and as I said in my prepared remarks, I think we're at around the $700 million marks to touch under it, and we'll finish up the $800 million we would expect in the month of May. And we still have ample liquidity, notwithstanding the Paymerang acquisition. As we sit here today, we've got over a $1 billion on the revolver outstanding and we have additional liquidity should we want to be in the market above the $800 million. And as we also look at our business, there could be other sources of capital that we're able to create over the course of the year as well that give us additional liquidity if there's some non-core assets that we end up divesting of if that played out.
Ron Clarke: Hey, Ramsey, it's Ron. So I did mention at the top that we have a pipeline. So we're working on some additional transactions. So my answer on top of Tom's would be, I would expect us to do to both of those things, likely buy more companies this year, and depending on where our stock price is, buy back more stock. And so between the liquidity that we have the leverage ratio and then we're getting close on a couple of divestitures, that gets us capital. We feel we got, obviously plenty of liquidity to do both of those things rest of the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nate Svensson with Deutsche bank.
Nate Svensson: Hey, guys, thanks for the question. Maybe kind of following up on that repurchase question, can you talk a little bit more about the corporate actions you're taking to offset that softness that you're seeing in lodging. So I guess specifically, what are you doing to lower OpEx? And then related to the repurchase question, I think on one of the slides you've talked about increasing repurchases. So how does that tie in versus the $800 million plan and what was incorporated into guide previously? And I guess the follow up is how much of these actions have already been completed, and is there any risk in executing these that may weigh out results as we move through the year?
Tom Panther: Yes, sure. I think it's a range of options. That's one of the things that's good about the company and the way it's structured and the levers we have do a variety of things related to the OpEx side that is just kind of just good old fashioned belt tightening. We'll look at some things, maybe some projects that we could delay, some t and e that we could avoid, things like that that are more, I would say, structural. We don't want to do anything to infringe upon the go forward power of the company from a sales and marketing perspective. So I think that's fairly sacred ground. But there are always some things that we can do to adjust on some fixed costs that come out. Plus there will be some natural variable costs that come out as well below the EBITDA line. There's some things that we've already executed related to some cross currency swaps that allows us to essentially convert a portion of our debt. We've already done a euro denominated, we've done a sterling and a canadian. So that causes our debt to be about 25% converted to foreign, which is still low relative to how you think about the overall company. And then we've had in the queue for a while just a variety of tax planning ideas that we would have executed with or without the softness and lodging, but those are coming together at a fortuitous time where that can also offset from an earnings perspective. So I would say there's good line of sight into those company actions, the no Hail Marys in there, and now it's just about executing, which I think we've got some pretty good demonstrated performance of being able to execute and deliver on those.
Ron Clarke: But no additional stock repurchases are in that recovery. So we said, hey, 1940 was our, was our guide. Hey, 19, because of the effects and the interest rates. Hey, we'll get the $0.40 backstage at 19. That doesn't assume any incremental buybacks above the 800, which we may do depending on the stock price.
Nate Svensson: Got it. That's helpful. Color. And I guess from my follow up, Ron, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned for a positive for the full year that you had greater visibility into some of your high performing businesses? So I guess namely corporate payments international vehicle in Brazil. So maybe you can talk about what you're seeing across those businesses. What gives you that confidence into the greater visibility. And then maybe growth expectations across each of those three for the full year?
Ron Clarke: Yes. I mean, always, Nate, when you lay out a plan and the businesses volume rate revenue is tracking and the initiatives that you've laid out are tracking. And so, for example, in corporate payments, I don't know how many times we've mentioned it over the last couple of years as channel partners. Oh shit. The growth is wherever we said, hey, it's 17% at the print, but 21 without channel partners. And I think we went on record really in the last call last year and said, hey, that thing's turning. We've kind of renewed some stuff with some existing partners and signed some new ones. So instead of that thing declining, it's going to actually turn and start increasing. And so we have those contracts signed and we're starting to put some of that volume through. So that'd be like an example of sitting here now on the other side of that I can see. And another big partner, we signed up there too in the last 45 days. So that would be an example of things that actually happened that are in the rear view that will create that acceleration of the rest of the year. In Brazil. I'd say it's just the power of the distribution. We have ten ways to sell tags and fuel and parking and insurance there and they're just rocking the bank channel thing we launched a couple of years ago with Santander and Kasia. They're selling a pile like 1015 percent of all of our new tags. Now coming through that brand new channel, the cross sell is working. I think we've sold a million insurance policies. We bought this app pay thing, which is super unique, to add, obviously this demand, it grew at 50% in the quarter. So the things that we plan in the businesses to make the businesses go, we're seeing real evidence in this first, whatever, four months that that stuff's working. And the materials that we need to get the forward numbers are clear. Obviously there's less months less. So I just say that they're beating the plan we put together for the first four months. And the progress suggests to me that they'll beat the plan, the remaining eight.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Kennedy with William Blair.
Chris Kennedy: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Ron, you talked about narrowing the focus of the business. You also alluded to some potential divestitures. Can you just kind of frame what you're thinking about the relative size of the, these initiatives?
Ron Clarke: Chris, are you asking first about the size of the divestitures? The size of the divestitures. And then you also talked about narrowing the focus of the business. So just, I'm trying to get how big of a narrow the focus of the business are you thinking here? How material is that? Yes. Let me start with the second part of the question and then go back to the more important first part. So, yeah, we, as part of the strategic review, we identified a couple of kind of smallish column in the $200 million to 300 million dollar range, kind of market price for the assets. One in our vehicle business, really both in and around our vehicle business. And so we're well along on those things with counterparties. So with those transactions, I said before, we'll have a simpler company and will redeploy that capital. But on the more important question, I think we spent the last year studying the company and said the most important thing to create value in the company was the fleet transformation and the redefinition of our fleet business to be a broader vehicle business right across the US, Brazil and Europe, and then even adding the consumer leg right to that business. And so those three segments, vehicle, corporate payments and lodging, are where we're headed. There's obviously plenty and plenty of tam and coverage for us to go get. We have new products in all three of them. And so the conclusion from all of us going through the thing is, let's just double down there. We did all this friggin Humpty Dumpty work the last five years to assemble this company in these segments, buying stuff, stitching it, fixing it. So we finally have, I think, super advantaged products in these segments. And so we're really in the marketing and sales phase. Right. Just basically sell more stuff in these three areas. And the reason I like it is it's just an easier company to manage. There's less kind of, call it Humpty Dumpty, figure it out, work, connect stuff, work. It's more kind of just basic sell stuff and then add related stuff, like the pay merang thing or, the Zappa thing, add stuff that's in the three segments. So we're going to be on that course for a while, just chasing to grow these three segments and maybe making acquisitions in those three segments.
Operator: Our next question comes from Pete Christiansen with Citigroup.
Peter Christiansen: Thank you. Good evening. Thanks for the question, Ron. I think I certainly appreciate the deeper versus wider approach, product homogenization, all that. Just curious, as you're looking out the next three years, are you considering making any changes to, like the margin versus growth kind of trade off that algorithm? Do you see opportunities there to kind of invest more and maybe spur growth a bit, a bit harder?
Tom Panther: Yes. Hey, Pete, it's a good question. I think you probably have heard a bit of the answer. I like that. Right. As an idea, even if it trims, if you will, margins for a while, if you could see the return. But I think I said this to you repeatedly, we're into profitable growth and so the incremental marketing and sales investment has to be productive. I don't want to spend another $50 million and it doesn't produce anything. And so, as with people, these things take some time to build and so you're better off. Let's say you're spending Ron Clarke $300 million last year to spend $300 million , $350 million and $400 million , $450 million over the next three years, rather than, hey, watch me go from $300 million to $400 million to $500 million. You'll have a lot more waste in those bigger steps, way more newbie people, way less productivity, and obviously you'll eat more profits. And so I say with that balance in mind, if we saw things, particularly around the digital front, where we could spend more that was productive, we would do that and probably take some costs out of other places. But look, it's working. We're selling enough of the businesses we have. We're planning to be up 20% again. I think we finished what guys at 20% last year in sales. And so if we can keep compounding sales at 20% and kind of growing marketing and sales investment, that's all we need, Pete, to compound the top at 10, 20 minus 10% retention. Sorry, attrition is 10% growth. And so that's really the model. Just stay on that. Make productive sales, keep profits growing at the same time.
Peter Christiansen: Thanks, I appreciate that. And then on the Paymarang deal, talking about revenue synergies, obviously scaling it versus core pay's infrastructure is, is an obvious opportunity there. I'm just curious if you believe there's any cross selling opportunities here on the synergy side, perhaps layering those new verticals versus other product categories that you may be selling?
Tom Panther: Yes, for sure. I mean, I think I did mention there's both revenue synergies and, to your point, obvious cost synergies. So one, for example, which we do in all these transactions, is Tom mentioned the merchant network. So that company has 250,000 merchants. We have about a million. And each of us pay some amount of those merchant network with virtual cards. So as part of the diligence, we run an overlap where each of us could find merchants that we have that the other guy is paying with a virtual card that we're not, and vice versa. So obviously, we're going to go right back and try to put each guy's respective merchants, if you will, on virtual card. That creates lift. They have contracts with banks and processes that are six times as expensive as us because of their scale. That's all contra revenue. So for a dollar of spend, we bring way more of it to the revenue line, for example, than they do. And then there's the whole card business. All they have, basically, is full ap. Right. They help companies with what we call invoice automation, fix the process and the workflow, and then payment automation or outsourcing, pay all the bills. Well, we have, as a big card business. Walk around cards, business cards, fuel cards, even standalone virtual cards that they don't have because they're not in the card business. They're not an issuer, they're not a processor. And so clearly, we've looked at that as well, us bringing, putting some of our sales guys against their base to sell our cars. So, Yes, there's not only clear paw synergy, there's a bunch of revenue synergies. So we expect to think it's already growing, I don't know, 20% or 30% on its own. It's a great business. It's super duper good people, which I want to call out as an asset, too. You can't run companies without people. So when you add our super adjacent capabilities, we think the thing will perform really well.
Peter Christiansen: That's super helpful. Thank you. Sounds very interesting.
Ron Clarke: Thank you. And there's not many of them, Pete. The other thing is, they're scarce. Right. There's only a handful, really, that we're aware of any kind of sizable people that do what we call full AP in the middle market, really of any size. And obviously we know them all.
Operator: Our next question comes from Trevor Williams with Jefferies.
Trevor Williams: Great, thanks. I want to go back to fleet and just how you guys are thinking about the shape of the year. I think the prior guide for vehicle had assumed fleet would get back to back up to the high single digits or so by the end of the year. Just if that still holds and the level of visibility you have into the acceleration on your mentioning late fees, retention, anything there would be helpful. Thanks
Ron Clarke: Trev, it's Ron again. So you called it right. So if you took our vehicle business and you looked at our internal documents of how we build into the end of the second half, you're right. Show the vehicle business in total exiting in the high single digits both in Q3 and in Q4. So again, part of that is the lapping of the pivot. North America and the other two businesses that are sitting inside vehicle are performing fine and well and compounding. And so that's the view that we'd go from kind of low mid single digits for vehicle to high single digits as we exit the year.
Trevor Williams: Okay, got it. And then on corporate payments, Tom, I think you called out higher rev per transaction being a tailwind on the direct piece. Should we think going forward on top of the new sales growth? That's kind of how we've been oriented to think about growth in the business. That pricing could maybe be a bigger lever for growth across both direct and cross border. Thanks.
Ron Clarke: Yes, Trevor, I went over emphasize the pricey beat. Obviously we always look to price competitively. I think what you're seeing in our trend line of rev per trend is just a mix variance there in terms of where channel was a bigger portion of first quarter of last year. You also see that in our spend numbers where they were dominating spend numbers kind of diluted the overall year over year, but sequentially you see 10% growth. That also translated into the take rate. So I think what you see is a run rate take rate is pretty good. We'll look for opportunities to optimize on any kind of pricing or monetization strategies, but it's more of a mix when you're looking in the rear view mirror than it is some kind of over pricing strategy that we've deployed. That's true also within cross border, I know we focus a lot on payables, but the cross border business as well as the mix of that business has also been toward products where we earn more. We're doing more sophisticated type FX transactions on behalf of our customers, and because of that we're getting paid. And so that too is factoring into that overall trend and the shift in mix from kind of the basic stuff, commoditized kind of stuff, to the more specialized, sophisticated stuff that we're bringing our customers.
Tom Panther: Hey, Trevor, let me make sure you guys get clear on this price thing and how we can be, can be advanced. Let's say simplistically that we're managing spend for you and there's 250 basis points of interchange and we agree to split the thing. I'll give you a rebate of 125 basis points and I'll keep 125, as keep for me, for revenue. For me, the pitch to get more price isn't just the split of the 250, it's how much of your spend I can get on virtual card. So if you spend a million dollars a month and I can get 20% on and someone else can only get ten, I don't necessarily have to meet the 125 basis point rebate because I'm going to return you way more absolute money. So we're able to capture effectively a better price, a better keep price than banks, which are, I'd say the main competition, because of our merchant network and tech, allows us to in people, we get way more of the client spend on card programs, thus generating a bigger pool, and so we can effectively keep more money than other people and still have better value to the client. So I just want to pick up on Tom's comment that although it's not kind of pure price, it does result in a price advantage for us.
Operator: Our next question comes from James Fossett with Morgan Stanley.
James Fossett: Thank you very much. Delved into a lot of different topics. I want to just quickly, I guess, in the interest of completeness, go back to the EV. And you provided some interesting comments there and certainly appreciate the detail on the UK EV economics, but I'm just wondering if you can unpack what's driving the increased penetration of EV carts relative to fuel cards. I mean, this is as simple on an incremental basis as mixed fleet is growing and share more broadly, or is there something else going on there?
Ron Clarke: Yes. Hey, James, it's Ron. So the exhibits in the supplement again, I think what we're trying to say there is of a sample of whatever 300 or 400 clients that we've had for some period of time. The chart shows that they're incrementally adding EV relative to combustion. Right. So the percentage of total vehicles among that pool of clients is becoming more EV. I think the main point we're trying to say is that because we do not only, on the road, but also at home with a super high attach rate, we can actually get more revenue per vehicle, per EV vehicle than we can from old fashioned combustion vehicles. So that's the point we're really trying to make to everybody is, oh, woe is me. When the world goes to more EV, fleet or Corpe will be hurt by it. We're trying to make the point that, no, no, no clients are willing to pay for this mixed solution we have and on the road and at home, and even as they grow to a higher and higher share of EV vehicles to total, we keep getting paid more, not less. That's really what we're trying to show you there. It's really just a share of wallet. We're keeping, obviously, the ice, the ice business, the fuel. But as they evolve their fleet to EV, we're getting that business as well. So it's incremental business for us.
James Fossett: That's great. I appreciate that. And then I just wanted to. To get one last point here. I think you've broken down kind of the growth expectations for corporate payments and talked about pricing and some of those things. I just want to make sure I understand. Are we close to channel drag being over and that stopping, being kind of a headwind, or how should we think about the timing of that? What does channel drag mean? Channel or channel partners?
Ron Clarke: Oh, the channel partners, Yes. So again, yes is the short answer. I'd say for sure by Q three. And then again, the thing, point to point, the channel itself is actually higher, I think, when we get to Q three and Q four. So, yes, I'd say maybe the quarter we're sitting in is the last time. Hopefully we'll have to talk about this. And again, I said it earlier, our confidence. My confidence is high in it because the stuff that's forward is literally contracted. So we just have to make sure we implement it.
Operator: Thanks so much. Our next question comes from Daniel Krebs with Wolfe Research. Hi, this is Daniel on Verdairn.
Daniel Krebs: Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to unpack some of the drivers of fleet transaction growth down 12% year-over-year. Is this also primarily driven by the loss of the micro fleets?
Tom Panther: It seems like maybe a bigger impact than we would have expected. I think you're looking at the print there, and that would be Russia, where we would have Russia in the prior year. I think if you look at the organic is probably where we reference the pro forma macro adjusted is a better indication. You see transactions up 7% and then we kind of break that down based on some of the different types of transactions that now flow through the whole vehicle payment segment.
Daniel Krebs: Okay, got it. So that won't be an issue then moving forward then maybe as a follow up on corpay, could you speak to the performance across the FX versus the full AP business? Any material delta between the two in terms of revenue or volume growth there? Thank you.
Ron Clarke: Yes. Hey, Krebs, its Ron. No, they're kind of the same. They're both growing high teens to 20%. So not a big difference. Across border business is a bit bigger. Call it. I know 30% bigger won't be quite as big after we get close this pay merang, but no, they're quite similar. The one thing I will point out between the two businesses, just to remind everybody, is the cross border business has a massive tam because we originate customers in five geographies. So only about a quarter of that business is Us origination. The other 75% of it is know Canada, UK, Europe, Australia. And so you've got way number of companies and prospects to basically fish in the pond in that business because they sit in lots of geographies.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dave Koning with Baird.
David Koning: Yes. Hey guys. Thank you. And I guess one follow up on just the channel drag question. Are we still going to see for a couple more quarters kind of flattish corporate payment volume? We're going to keep seeing that. And then by Q4, it reaccelerates when you hit the easier comp. Is that a fair way to think about that?
Ron Clarke: It is, yes. Because the channel, remember, is lots of spend at no rate and the direct is obviously less spend at a decent rate. What you just said is right. Once the channel gets cleaned up effectively and is on its own, is higher than the prior period, that will wash away. Yes. And you accelerated corporate, which was great, even with the transaction decelerating.
David Koning: So that was good. My follow up quick share count was flat sequentially, despite big, big buybacks in Q1. Was that just timing in March? So we'll see a lot more in Q2?
Tom Panther: Yes. David, a little bit of that is also the stock price. So when stock price goes up, there's more dilution on the options and restricted stock. That's outstanding. So that kind of counterbalances some of the actions that were taken on the buyback front. So there's a little bit of a headwind when it comes to that. But with the buybacks, as you said, back end loaded to Q1 and then active in the first month of Q2, there'll be a bigger benefit when we print Q2.
Operator: Our final question comes from Rufus Hone with BMO Capital Markets.
Rufus Hone: Hey, guys, thanks for the question.Just wanted to ask on the same store sales, and I. I know you mentioned it's improved a percentage point sequentially to minus two this quarter. I guess. What's the path and the timeline for getting that back to flat? Is that a two Q goal or more like something around year end? Thanks.
Tom Panther: Yes, I would say it's probably closer to year end. A lot of it turns again on this lodging thing, which I mentioned was called ten or 11%. And the big period there is q three. The other one I think I did call out, or if I didn't the last time, the UK as an economy has been a bit soft in the last year, and so that would be the other dragger. I'd say the rest of them are improving. So I think part of our plan would be the minus three, the minus two that that thing gets back to close to flat by Q4.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-07 17:30:00) =====

 Please note our earnings release and supplement can be found under the Investor Relations section on our website at fleetcor.com. Now throughout this call, we will be covering organic revenue growth. As a reminder, this metric neutralizes the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and fuel spreads. It also includes pro forma results for acquisitions and divestitures or scope changes closed during the 2 years being compared.
 We will also be covering non-GAAP financial metrics, including revenues, net income and net income per diluted share, all on an adjusted basis. These measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than at other companies. Reconciliations of historical non-GAAP to the most directly comparable GAAP information can be found in today's press release and on our website.
 I also need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today may include forward-looking statements. These statements reflect the best information we have as of today. All statements about our outlook, new products and expectations regarding business development and future acquisitions are based on that information. They are not guarantees of future performance, and you should not put undue reliance upon them. We undertake no obligation to update any of these statements.
 Now the expected results are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K and in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available on our website and at sec.gov. So with that out of the way, I will turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay, Jim. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q4 2023 earnings call. Upfront here, I'll plan to cover 4 subjects: first, provide my take on both Q4 and full year 2023 results; second, I'll share our 2024 priorities and guidance; third, give you a bit of an update on the status of our strategic review; and then lastly, highlight a few pretty exciting new products that we've recently launched.
 Okay. Let me begin with our Q4 results, which, frankly, were a bit mixed. We reported revenue of $937 million, up 6%; cash EPS of $4.44, up 10%; and  EBITDA of approximately $500 million, up 11%. Q4 revenue did finish a bit weaker than we outlooked 90 days ago, but fortunately, our earnings flow-through was quite a bit better than expected. That was helped mainly by credit losses finishing at about half the level of last year.
 The revenue weakness in the quarter showed up in a few areas. First, gift cards. So we had some delays in gift card shipments that have been pushed here into Q1. In Lodging, we had a pretty soft distressed passenger vertical in the quarter, mostly because airline cancellations were at a record low level. North America fleet late fees, pretty light.
 That, again, is a continuation of exiting a lot of micro accounts that we started about a year ago when we tightened credit terms. Again, fortunately, the late fee reduction was essentially washed away by the improvement in credit losses. And then last year is our Corporate Payments or payables business with a channel partner business finishing even softer than we had outlooked. Fortunately there, we think it's bottomed out.
 So these kind of weak spots, soft spots were either timing-related, weather-related or have kind of reached the end, have kind of bottomed out as we head into our 2024 guide. So hopefully, not surprising us again. The organic revenue growth in Q4, 7% overall, again, impacted by the soft spots I just called out. The Vehicle Payments organic revenue growth, 5% for the quarter. Corporate Payments revenue growth of 15%, but 20% if you exclude the partner channel.
 Trends in Q4, also a bit mixed. Retention, quite good, improved slightly to 92%. Sales grew 12% overall with a terrific performance in Corporate Payments. Sales there up over 40%. And what we call same-store sales finished 3% down. Again, we saw the weakness in the workforce lodging, in the airline lodging business and a bit in the U.K.
 Okay. Let me make the turn to our full year 2023 results, which reached record levels. 2023 revenue of $3.8 billion, up 10%; EBITDA of approximately $2 billion, up 13%; and cash EPS of $16.92, up 5%. Trends for full year 2023, quite good. Sales for the full year, up 20% overall. And again, inside of that, Corporate Payment sales up about 50%. We did sell 100,000 new B2B clients in 2023. In terms of organic revenue growth, full year, 10%, so that makes 3 consecutive years of 10% plus organic revenue growth. And again, retention stable at 92%.
 Additionally, we did advance a number of important strategic initiatives in the year, progressed EV and our understanding of the relative economics of EV versus ICE. So promising results there. We did clean up our Russia and FTC issues. We did introduce this transformation idea for our Fleet business, envisioning it really as a broader Vehicle Payments-related business. We did close a couple of important acquisitions, one in cross-border, which we fully have integrated, and one in parking, really to jump-start our consumer vehicle payments initiative. So look, all in all, a pretty successful year.
 Okay. Let me make the transition to our 2024 guidance and start out by outlining our major objectives for the year. So a few things. First, as always, to deliver financial performance that's consistent with our midterm objectives. Second, we hope to deepen our position in Corporate Payments through some new acquisitions in that space. Third, we hope to build out our Vehicle Payments business with proof of successful cross-selling and accelerate revenue growth throughout the year. And then lastly, to succeed with some new product launches and confirm market acceptance for them.
 So on to our 2024 financial guide. So revenue at the midpoint of $4,080 million. that's up 9% on a print basis or 11% excluding Russia. EBITDA of $2.2 billion. that's up 11% or 14% excluding Russia. And finally, cash EPS at the midpoint of $19.40, up 15% print and up 18% excluding Russia. So let me just say that again, planning '24 profits, cash EPS growth of 18% this year, excluding Russia.
 We are expecting good earnings flow through to EPS. One, revenue will grow faster throughout the year than expense, so that operating leverage will help, and we do expect to have fewer shares, better FX and a slightly lower tax rate. In terms of revenue and organic growth, we're obviously helped by our Q4 exit rate in the sales from last year growing here into 2024. We are expecting higher sales levels here in 2024, which will add to revenue.
 And then we do have a number of cross-sell initiatives planned into our client base this year. So in the Fleet business, selling business cards, EV, parking, breakdown services back into the fleet clients. And in Brazil, the toll business, selling insurance, parking, fuel back into the toll base. Tom in a bit will provide some more specifics on the 2024 guide and how it rolls out across the year. We also plan to mark the next chapter of the company with the rebranding of FLEETCOR to Corpay, and that's scheduled for March.
 Okay. Let me make the turn to our strategic review. So just as a reminder, we did initiate a formal strategic review of our portfolio last spring and initially focused on the question of whether separating our Fleet business from our Corporate Payments business could unlock value for shareholders. We have run a pretty rigorous process over the last 11 months with a lot of help, particularly from Goldman Sachs. We fielded numerous inbounds, looked at lots of alternatives and explored some combinations with dance partners.
 I got to say the review process was quite helpful for us in exploring some -- really some new structures for the company and spotlighted the value creation potential of transitioning really our Fleet business into a broader Vehicle Payments business that will serve both businesses and consumers. So that's a super high priority for us. So look, we're announcing really the conclusion today of the review process. At least for the time being, we determined that keeping our Fleet business and Corporate Payments together is the best way forward. Obviously, we remain open to reconsidering various options to unlock value down the road, but right now, squarely focused on repositioning the Vehicle Payments business.
 Okay. My last subject upfront here is on new products. We've released 4 new products into the marketplace this year, each with really terrific potential. So first, what we call our Corpay One business card, fuel card and virtual card in one. That's targeted to fuel-based businesses, where the solution includes a business card for the owner, fuel cards for the field drivers and even replaces paper checks with virtual cards. That's all in one account and all in one UI, so pretty exciting.
 Second, product we call the Comdata Connect Card. It's targeted to small trucking companies. So it connects the Comdata truck stop fuel discounts and reporting to the companies, the trucking company's, existing business credit card. So trucking firms here would really get the best of both worlds. They continue to get the credit and rewards from their existing business card, but combine that with the fuel discounts and reporting of a truck stop card. Look, this also helps us in terms of the credit challenge with small trucking companies, so hopefully, we can bring on lots of small trucking firms without the credit risk.
 Third up is a product that we call Corpay Complete. It's our newest Corporate Payments product targeted to midsized businesses. And again, this is really a platform build. So we've combined what we call walk around solutions, business cards and fuel cards, really with the central kind of AP automation solution, again, packaged all in one platform, all in one mobile app. So really, we think kind of the modern way really for businesses to manage their all-around business expenses and spend less.
 And lastly, in Lodging, we have a new product called CLC Choice. So it's really a workforce lodging solution for employers who want really a more friendly and flexible employee travel solution with the idea being more choice for travelers. So in this case, travelers could choose virtually any hotel, any room type and even keep rewards points from their favorite hotel brand. So we think the Choice solution will complement really our current control solution and widen the market opportunity there.
 So look, we're super excited about these new products have been in the kitchen for quite a while and hopeful that this new set of products will accelerate revenue 1% to 2% over time. Okay. So look, in conclusion, today, 2023, really a record year, record revenue, record earnings, Organic revenue growth for the full year up 10%. Sales, super good, up 20%. Stable retention at 92%.
 Made some good moves to position the company better for the midterm. EV progress and our new go-forward Vehicle Payment strategy. 2024 we're planning profits or cash EPS up 18% excluding Russia, and that's on really an assumption of flat interest expense, launching a set of new products that we have high hopes for. And then beginning really the next chapter for the company as we move to rebrand the company to Corpay in March.
 So with that, let me turn the call back over to Tom to provide some additional detail on the quarter. Tom? 
Thomas Panther: Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. Here are some additional details related to the quarter and the full year. Organic revenue growth was 7%, the same as the fourth quarter of last year. Revenue growth was slightly below our expectations due to pockets of softness, mostly in U.S. Vehicle Payments and Lodging, while our Corporate Payments and international businesses continue to perform well.
 The revenue weakness was mostly offset by strong expense discipline, continued improvements in bad debt expense and a lower tax rate, which delivered $4.44 per share in cash EPS, within our guidance and up 10% versus last year. Looking at the full year, organic revenue grew 10% and  EBITDA increased 13%, which are both in line with our midterm targets. We also absorbed nearly $200 million of incremental interest expense during the year due to the rate hikes and still posted cash EPS growth of 5%. Normalizing for the higher interest expense, adjusted earnings would have grown 16% for the full year 2023.
 Now turning to our segment performance and the underlying drivers of our revenue growth. Corporate Payments revenue was up 15% during the quarter and increased 19% for the full year. For the quarter, our direct business grew 19% and was again led by growth in full AP. Our full suite of high-quality payment solutions continues to sell extremely well, with sales up 27% this quarter, as we sign up customers who are looking to modernize their AP operations. I'd note that the drag from lower partner channel volumes accelerated in the quarter, with channel revenue declining 31%.
 Excluding the partner channel, revenue grew 20% and spend volumes increased 27% in the quarter, so quite strong on a core basis. We believe the partner channel volumes have bottomed, and volumes and revenue are expected to be flat in 2024. Cross-border revenue was up 21%, sales grew 51%, and  recurring client transaction activity was robust. We've now fully lapped all the revenue synergies from the GRG acquisition in January 2023.
 More importantly, our best-in-class technology, service and products allow us to have market-leading retention and client acquisition, which you can see in our results. We continue to make significant investments in this business through increased sales and marketing resources as well as new product capabilities.  Over the last few years, we have transformed this business into becoming the largest nonbank provider of B2B FX payment solutions in the world.
 Turning to Vehicle Payments. Recall this is the new segment that we introduced on our last earnings call. It reflects the combination of our Fleet and Brazil businesses, along with our new consumer vehicle initiative. Consistent with our goal of creating a simpler company, we have now put all vehicle-related payment solutions in one segment that operates across North America, Brazil and Europe, offering a full suite of vehicle-related solutions to both businesses and consumers.
 You'll note that we have defined the new segment's KPI as transactions. But given the different products that comprise the segment, we've provided transaction counts by product type, such as fleet, tags and parking. We've also realigned our executive team to support this new segment, with Armando Netto serving as the Group President of North America and Brazil, and Alan King as the Group President over International Fuel, EV and Parking.
 Vehicle Payments organic revenue increased 5% during the quarter, with particular strength in Brazil and international fuel markets. In the U.K., more than 30% of all new sales involve a nonfuel product. namely EV or vehicle maintenance. Our EV strategy in the U.K. is clearly winning as our 3-in-1 product, fuel, on-road charging and at-home charging, all in one app has more than doubled from a year ago. The results speak for themselves with both EV cards and EV revenue continuing to increase.
 In addition, we're having great success selling our at-home charging solution with a 30% attachment rate to all new sales. Our charging network also continues to expand, and we now offer charging at over 600,000 charge points in Europe. And by the end of March, we will have coverage of nearly 80% of the rapid chargers in the U.K., including Tesla, which we signed in the fourth quarter.
 In Brazil, we ended the year with nearly 6,000 extended network locations, including 2,500 gas stations, 2,900 parking locations, 750 drive-through restaurants and 270 condos. Total tags were up 7% year-over-year to nearly 7 million and approximately 37% of customer spend was from our Beyond Toll network. Sales of insurance policies are up fourfold when we launched in Q4 '22 to nearly $200,000 in Q4 '23, so from 0 to $200,000 per quarter in 5 quarters and now total over 1 million policies.
 Our success in Brazil is a tangible proof point of our broader vehicle payments vision to leverage an anchor product used by a large customer base and to then add additional services via a mobile app driving incremental revenue growth. We are leveraging our strong success in the U.K. to launch our consumer vehicles payment solution in the market. We have begun selling the parking network that we acquired in the third quarter via PayByPhone to our business customers and are building the integrations to be able to offer to the over 2 million PayByPhone consumer users in the U.K. access to our proprietary fuel, EV, insurance, toll and maintenance networks.
 In the U.S., softness in small fleet and the impact from our shift away from micro clients continue to affect our sales and revenue results. Our digital and field sales efforts are improving as we continue to see growth in applications, approvals and starts. As we mentioned last quarter, the shift to higher credit quality clients also impacted late fees, which were down 38% from Q4 '22. While the decline in late fees is a drag on our revenue growth, it has resulted in a similar decline in bad debt expense, so essentially a wash.
 Lodging revenue was flat Q4 2022, and for the year, the business grew 12%. This quarter was affected by continued softness in our existing workforce customers, which appears to have now stabilized. Certain verticals within the business like airline and insurance can have quarterly revenue growth fluctuations driven by weather and natural disasters. Recall in Q4 of last year, there were significant weather events and airline cancellations, which benefited the airline and the insurance verticals.
 By comparison, there were no major weather events in Q4 of this year. And in fact, according to the Department of Transportation, 2023 flight cancellations were the lowest in a decade, and in the fourth quarter, cancellations were down approximately 90% from Q4 '22. We're experiencing similar results related to insurance claims, which were down approximately 20% in the quarter. Despite the recent soft quarters, we are confident that this business can return to low double-digit growth over the coming quarters.
 We recently launched new product capabilities that will extend our customer experience and drive new sales. Additionally, we're excited to welcome Joff Romoff as the new Group President of Lodging, replacing the retiring Ron Rogers. Joff has extensive hospitality and lodging experience that will be a strong asset to the business. In summary, we're proud of the performance we delivered in 2023. It clearly demonstrates the growth of our diversified business and the strength of our business model that generated over  $1.25 billion of free cash flow.
 Now looking down the income statement. Q4 operating expenses of $513 million were flat versus Q4 of last year. Expenses from acquisitions, higher transaction and sales activities and investments to drive future growth were offset by lower bad debt expense and the sale of our Russia business. Bad debt expense declined $19 million or nearly 50% from last year to $22 million or 3 basis points of spend. Most of the decline was in vehicle payments, which was down $17 million year-over-year as we realize the benefit from our lower exposure to U.S. micro clients.
 EBITDA margin in the quarter was 54.2%, a 220 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter of last year. This positive operating leverage is driven by solid revenue growth, lower bad debt expense, disciplined expense management and synergies realized from recent acquisitions. Interest expense this quarter increased $18 million year-over-year, and the impact of higher interest rates resulted in an approximate $0.27 drag on Q4 adjusted EPS, partially offset by lower debt balances year-over-year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.3% versus 24.2% last year. The lower rate related to specific tax planning items.
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We are entering 2024 with the balance sheet in excellent shape. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in unrestricted cash, up $300 million from 90 days ago, and we had over $800 million available on our revolver. We have $5.4 billion outstanding on our credit facilities, and we had $1.4 billion borrowed under our securitization facility. As of year-end, our leverage ratio was 2.4x trailing 12 months EBITDA, which is at the lower end of our target range.
 In January, we upsized our term loan A and revolver A credit facilities by $600 million with no rate concessions and no change in the maturity. This added capital will provide incremental capacity and flexibility for both deals and share buybacks in 2024, which I'll elaborate on in a few minutes. Our capital allocation in 2023 was once again balanced as we deployed $1.6 billion. In the quarter, we repurchased roughly 600,000 shares at an average price of $254 per share or $143 million. For the year, we repurchased 2.6 million shares for $690 million.
 We spent $545 million on acquisitions during the year, improving our position in EV, the consumer vehicle payment space and cross-border. We used the remaining excess cash flows for debt amortization and reducing our revolver balance.  As I previously mentioned, our 2024 capital allocation plan is supported by our significant cash and liquidity position. We have $1.4 billion in unrestricted cash and increased our capacity on our revolver by $600 million, and we expect to generate $1.4 billion in free cash flow during 2024. Our first priority remains M&A, and the M&A pipeline is robust. We'll look to acquire businesses that deepen our position in our 3 core operating segments. 
 We are also allocating capital for share buybacks during 2024. In January, the Board increased our repurchase authorization by $1 billion. We now have over $1.6 billion authorized for share repurchases. We expect to repurchase $800 million of shares throughout the year. We plan to purchase these shares through the open market and will establish a 10b5-1 plan later this month. Any residual cash flows from earnings will be used to reduce our revolver or build our cash position. Generating so much cash is a high-class problem, and we plan to leverage this strength to systematically support our EPS growth through M&A and buybacks in 2024.
 Now let me share some thoughts on our 2024 full year and Q1 outlook. From an economic perspective,  we are not assuming a recession nor a meaningful economic improvement in overall business activity. Our forecast for the year is based on the consensus economic outlook in our markets, which generally calls for modest economic growth and lower interest rates in the second half of the year. We expect fuel prices to be a headwind in the first quarter, and for the full year, we're anticipating U.S. fuel prices to average $3.65 per gallon, which is a blend of diesel and unleaded. In 2024, we expect cash EPS to grow between 14% and 16%, which is inclusive of the planned buybacks I mentioned previously.
 Revenue growth is projected to be between 8% and 10%, and EBITDA is expected to increase 10% to 12% with margin expanding to approximately 54%. Keep in mind these growth rates are inclusive of our Russia business through mid-August of last year. Excluding Russia, cash EPS is growing 17% to 19%, revenue is up 10% to 12%, and EBITDA is increasing 13% to 15%, all slightly above our midterm growth targets. We've provided these details in our earnings supplement on Page 20.
 Net interest expense is projected to be between $340 million and $370 million, which includes the replacement of a $500 million interest rate swap that matured in December. Roughly 80% of our credit facility is now fixed utilizing swaps, and the blended swap rate is 4.1%. Also recall that our securitization is a variable rate facility. And finally, our tax rate is expected to be between 25% and 26%.
 From a segment perspective, we expect the following organic revenue growth rates: Vehicle Payments in the mid-single digits; Corporate Payments approximately 20%; Lodging Payments in the high single digits. Related to the quarters, we expect revenue growth in the first half of the year to be below our full year average due to the continued pockets of softness, a tough comp that includes Russia as well as a challenging operating environment, including lower fuel prices.
 We expect revenue growth to accelerate in the back half of the year as the economic outlook becomes clear, we lap the divestiture of Russia and we realize the benefits of our growth initiatives and new sales. For the first quarter, we're expecting revenue to grow between 3% and 5% and cash EPS to increase between 6% and 8%, which also reflects higher interest rates. Normalizing for Russia, revenue and cash EPS growth at the midpoint would be 7% and 13%, respectively. The rest of our assumptions can be found in our press release and supplement.
 Before completing my prepared remarks, I would like to extend our gratitude to our more than 10,000 employees around the world who helped us deliver such a great year and who will be the driving force to even greater heights throughout 2024.
 Thank you for your interest in our company. And now operator, we'd like to open the line for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Peter Christiansen with Citi. 
Peter Christiansen: Two questions for you, Ron. Just curious, you performed pretty well on the credit loss side. How are you thinking about, at least tactically, about extending credit in 2024 versus last year, particularly after improving the mix of your midsized -- mid-market clients? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Pete, good question. I'd say, looser. So the model that we've used has gotten a bit better over the last 12 months. And I think I called out credit losses coming in literally about half of the prior year. So I'd say we're going to kind of open this ticket carefully.
 And then second, again, that we're pointing to larger prospects with generally a better credit. So I guess we have the full year plan just a smidge lower than full year '23, but it should help on the revenue side. 
Peter Christiansen: That's helpful. And then, Ron, I guess now exiting the strategic review, how should we think about at least your acquisition -- M&A priorities going forward? Any particular areas, horizontal, vertical? Just want to get your fresh sense on FLEETCOR, soon to be Corpay's, M&A priorities going forward? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Another good question. Glad to be back at kind of the basic, buying companies. So the primary focus, Pete, is on Corporate Payments. So we've got a pipeline of a couple of interesting things in that space. And then the one other area that we're kind of on is this consumer capability, this idea again of getting a big block of consumers that we could market all of our networks to. So I would say those would be the two short-term things to look for. 
Operator: The next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. 
Ramsey El-Assal: I wanted to ask about some of the Q4 headwinds that you called out and just maybe ask you to give us a little more color on what was going on and the degree to which you're confident that they'll represent sort of transient headwinds rather than more permanent sort of impacts. I know you implied that as we get deeper into '24 that you could see some improvement, but I'm just curious if you could give us a little more color on what sort of happened in the quarter. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean, in a nutshell, Ramsey, I call it, the story of the quarter was same-store sales. So I called out it was minus 3%, and if you went back to our prior transcripts, Q4 '22 would have been plus 2%. So in that 12-month period, basically went from plus 2% to minus 3%. So obviously, that's 5 points of organic growth. So that's the whole story. Retention was good, sales were good, expense controls, credit below the line. Everything effectively in Q4 through my lenses was kind of in line sans that one call out.
 And so I tried to kind of go through it. They obviously were surprising to me since I looked through the guide pretty carefully. Really, it's just 2 or 3 pockets that are not new. If you go back and look at what we communicated in '23, we would have talked about lodging having some softness in the base, the partner channel and payables having some softness, the pivot from micro accounts, which shed a bunch of late fees, unfortunately, credit losses. And so, basically, I'd say those 3 things that I called out were just heavier, weightier on the downside, say, we're looking at kind of 1% to 2% minus same store and it came in at 3%.
 And so  that's really the story of the quarter. And so the good news, if there is any, is in all 3 of those cases, it deals like, in the data showing even through January, it looks like we've hit the bottom. So the thought process that we have is that we climb out of the same-store sales, almost to reverse pattern. So minus 3, minus 2, basically getting that thing back to positive because that book of business basically flatlined into '24. So that's basically the perspective on it. So it's really no new things. It's things that we have seen that basically were a bit heavier in the quarter than we outlooked. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. A follow-up for me. I was wondering if you could kind of comment on the closure of the strategic alternatives process and just kind of revisit what -- kind of a postmortem, in a sense. Why was it so difficult to find the strategic alternatives to execute on? Was it lack of attractive partners? Was it a valuation hang up? Was it rates? Where was the friction in the process that kind of prevented you guys from executing on that sort of monetization strategy? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Look, it's a super complicated question, right, which is why we spent 11 months on it, so [indiscernible] too quick with an answer here. But look, the main thing against just a straight SpinCo, I think we said, was uncertainty of the trading range of RemainCo wasn't so much. We got a great Corporate Payments business. It was really what's the multiple on RemainCo.
 So I think that caused us to pivot into this dance partner to -- if we were going to separate things, to do something that would have scale and synergies. And so the short answer to that is we engaged with 3 or 4 different partners, and it's a combination of either the synergies didn't pan out to be as good as we thought or we couldn't agree relative valuation, or in one case, maybe social issues around it.
 So these kinds of combinations, as you guys know, are always quite difficult. But I did say it seriously. We've learned a lot. We looked at a lot of structures. We've met a bunch of people. And so we will continue to look. The focus now is back on buying things in our lane and obviously rebuilding this vehicle business some, but we are open a different day to relooking at it again. So kind of closed for now, but not forever. 
Operator: The next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: I was just thinking on the new product side that you're going -- that you laid out here to enhance growth. I think you mentioned around 1 to 2 points over time. How quickly do you think that can convert into -- in your sales? Do you have the sales engine humming already? Just curious where you are with that. 
Ronald F. Clarke: So I mean the headline of why I call this out is, over the last 2 or 3 years, we've done a fair amount of what I term capability acquisitions. And really behind the scenes, those have been some tech capability acquisitions, right? The Corpay One, we bought an AP platform, a software platform called Accrualify. It's a front end. We bought a European workforce business with a brand-new platform.
 And so the tech that we got allowed us to spin up kind of some, I call them internally, kind of next-gen products that I described at the top. And so we're out selling them now, we've got a pretty robust sales plan for them. So I would say the convert would be next year. The key thing for us to report this year to you is sales of those products. And then obviously, next year, as those roll into revenue, basically, we'd expect the acceleration. So the key is what's the reception? Does the market like these 3 or 4 things that we'll put in front of them? 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Got it. Got it. And then just my follow-up, maybe for you, again, Ron, just thinking about visibility into revenue growth in '24 versus prior years. It feels like there's a little bit more reliance on new products and initiatives. I know cross-sell is something you've always done. Macro is always what it is, but how would you consider the visibility this year versus recent years? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, that's another super good question. It sounds like most things, some things stay the same and some things are different. So the most important thing for us, as you know, is sales, which is why I call out the growth rate. And I think I called out for the full year last year 20%. That's our target again for 2024, obviously, off of a bigger base.
 So the first thing is we've had success selling and expect the same year in '24. Two is the retention is getting a bit better. And as we flush those micro accounts last year, structurally, that should help retention. So you take those two things, those underpin, as you know, the basic right -- new business versus losses is the key to a recurring business.
 So the wildcard, the bet here has been the softness thing, which, again, entered the year in the plus column and then ended the year in the minus column, so that thing turning or getting tension back to flat, I think, is the most important in the acceleration. But then on top of that, we've got some super new pricing ideas around the technology as the new dynamic pricing, for example, where we could price rooms and lodging different for someone walking into a hotel than someone who prebooks 3 weeks ago instead of a platform that didn't let us differentiate.
 We've got a few new partners that we've signed that we haven't announced that will come on. And then to your point, we've got a big plan around cross-sell, adding a buck for vehicle insurance every time people park if they want it to basically allay the fear of something happening to their car when they park. So it's a pretty balanced -- I'd say it's not super different than the past, but I would say that the new products and some of the cross-sell should be a little more supportive than historically. 
Operator: The next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. 
Darrin Peller: Ron, maybe just go back to -- it's a bit of a follow-up to Tien-Tsin's question just now, but when we think of the vehicle segment and the aspirations for being mid-single -- I'm sorry, double-digit, low double-digit, growth from what we're now guiding to a mid-single-digit year, maybe just talk a little bit about the initiatives that you feel are going to really drive that strength?
 And it does look like you're having a lot of success, obviously, now with whether it's EV or obviously in Brazil. So I'm assuming it's a combination of all those factors, but any more color on that? And just a quick follow-up, but also the fourth quarter, I know you had some headwinds on certain variables, like you mentioned on the call, credit and -- it just seems like you would have a better growth in '24 than fourth quarter just as some of those abate, but yet you're guiding a similar rate of growth for vehicles. So just a little more color on that. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Say the last part, Darrin, guiding to what in '24? 
Darrin Peller: Yes, per vehicle segment, mid-single-digit growth. I would have thought it'd be a little bit better comparing it to a fourth quarter which I know has some headwinds in it. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. So let me take that last part and then back my way back to the beginning of your question. So yes, if you looked inside our quarterly roll, that thing would go from kind of low mid-single digit up to 10%. So the internal plan we have is exactly what you said to the vehicle organic growth rate to accelerate.
 So the two drivers of that beyond the normal things of retention, which should get better again structurally because we kicked out the micro accounts, and obviously, sales being good is the new products that I just talked about, right, some extensions in both the core fuel card business and in the trucking business, and to your point, the EV thing working.
 But the second one is this consumer, it's just all incremental. So to the extent that we can take 2 million people in the U.K. and another couple of million people, which we'll talk about soon, in Brazil, and add on 3 or 4 services that we already have, it's just every dollar there is incremental and pretty profitable.
 So those are really the two drivers. The base, same-store sales, retention and new sales, which we have a good handle on, and then the couple of new things and the new products and the consumers. So we're bullish on it. Obviously, we had a pivot in this vehicle thing and then a bit distracted working on this restructuring, but I think where we're headed now is super clear. 
Thomas Panther: And Darrin, one thing I'd add before Ron gets to your other question about longer-term vehicle. Keep in mind the first half of last year had the elevated late fees from the SMB micro clients that we still have on the platform. So we all start lapping that until you get into late Q2, so that creates a little bit of a grow-over challenge when you look at it on an annual basis. 
Ronald F. Clarke: And it's one of the reasons, Darrin, someone sent me some text of, hey, the revenue looks a little light. And we've effectively taken $20 million, $30 million of late fee revenue out and $20 million to $30 million of credit losses out. It's been basically kind of a one-for-one swap, which people out there may not like, but I like. I like the ratability of having lower credit losses. And so to Tom's point, that portfolio shift kind of moved both revenue and expense. 
Darrin Peller: That really -- that's helpful. I don't know if there's time for a quick follow-up. Just very quickly on Corpay. I just want to understand a little bit more on the channel business bottoming out here. And  maybe you can explain a little more of what the dynamic is and the underlying drivers, if it's around a channel -- one of the partners, if that's finished or its virtual card adoption or anything else, guys? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Let me take that one. Another good question. So if you think about what we call a channel business, it's some third-party U.S. customers where we provide virtual card processing. And the basic trend, which started 2 years ago, is those partners effectively moving from an exclusive relationship with us to nonexclusive.
 So I, Ron, I used to use you for 100% of my processing Someone told me it was a good idea to have 2 providers. So over time, I'm going to kind of give you half the business or I'm going to try to haircut your rate. So effectively, over the last 2 years, Darrin, we've gone from having call it, 15 really important partners that we were exclusive with to having 15 partners we're nonexclusive with.
 So the good news on this one is we have the contracts now for '24 that have us flat with '23. So our print for that business, which moved its way down during the course of '23, were out looking effectively flat revenue in that business across into '24. So instead of every quarter saying oh, the Corporate Payments business was great, but hey, the channel business was crummy, hopefully, you'll hear me say that in '24. The answer will be it will be flat. 
Operator: The next question comes from Nate Svensson with Deutsche Bank. 
Christopher Svensson: So Darrin actually leads right into what I wanted to ask on Corporate Payments. Very -- first off, very nice to hear about the outlook for 20% growth in 2024. I wanted to ask, because in the past, you've talked about sort of a stickiness and resilience that you see with regards to suppliers continuing to accept virtual card payments despite the challenging macro, so maybe can you give us an update on how that sort of resilience has trended since we last spoke 3 months ago? Anything changing with the decision process with your suppliers? Or any update there would be great. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Nate, it's Ron. I'd say not much change. So I think we said it before that acceptance or nonacceptance of a virtual card turns really more on the profile of merchants. Merchants that have obviously higher margins, for example, are more accepting, or merchants more in need of cash flow because they're paid sooner. So I'd say there's really nothing super new. Kind of the opt-out rate, if you will, has been pretty steady. And again, who takes the card is really a function of kind of who the merchant is. So nothing new. 
Thomas Panther: And, Nate, we've actually seen card penetration levels tick up a little bit. So at the end of the day, it kind of comes down to the amount of spend that's on a card, and that's moved up as you look at it over a quarterly trend. 
Christopher Svensson: That's great to hear about the penetration levels. And so I know there's been a lot of talk about new products throughout the call. One I kind of wanted to dig deeper on was the new Corpay Complete products. I know there was a press release that came out at the end of January. So maybe you can talk about the go-to-market motion there, where you're seeing the sort of synergy potentials between the full AP offering, cross-border, et cetera, within that Corpay Complete? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. That's another good question. I mean, simplistically, Nate, we used to do knock, knock on a midsized company, hi, CFO, and hey, we've got some great expense management products here. And mostly, the pitch was kind of menu-based or a la carte. Hey, it looks like you got some drivers, we've got fuel cards. Looks like you need a better control business card, given some of the expenses that are coming in, or one that's got automated expense reimbursement.
 So historically, that's how we presented things. And so the idea was to be able to have kind of a [ RAP ], a rebate or look at the spend of the whole company. So knock, knock, hi CFO. You've got walk around spend, you've got AP spend. I could combine all of that and give you 100 basis points back, $0.5 million a month back and make your life easier. How does that sound?
 So we finally have a platform where all those things, the walk around stuff and the AP automation stuff is literally brought together, call it, in terms of one report, one credit underwriting system and stuff. And so that's the idea that we could present now to a company, effectively a package deal, if you will, instead of an a la carte deal. So we just literally been underway, call it, just what you said, call it, a month or so with the first set of leaves in it.
 But clearly, it's going to be the future. My hope is even if we sell someone a la carte the first day that they're on the railroad, it's easier to go back. They've learned how to use the UI. They know us, we have an account, we credit -- underwritten them and stuff. And so we think it certainly lends to better add-on sales over time. 
Operator: The next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Sorry, I hopped on a little bit late. I apologize if you've answered these questions, but just on the macro assumptions that you guys are using for the year, what kind of macro are you guys assuming sort of the beginning and ending of the year? 
Thomas Panther: Sure, Sanjay. It's Tom. So thinking big picture macro, let's start there, and then we can talk a little bit in terms of a more detailed macro as it relates to -- specific to our company. But big picture macro, we're expecting an economic outlook to stay relatively consistent, completely in line with the broad economic guide.
 When you look at our 3 major markets of Brazil, U.S. and U.K. we expect in all of those markets to see a relatively stable, maybe slightly improving economy as rate cuts in those various markets occur, but we're not expecting any kind of recession, and certainly, we're not expecting a GDP kind of gangbuster-type year.
 With respect to the more narrow macro that affects FLEETCOR, kind of think about it in terms of a couple of categories. First, fuel. Fuel price, average fuel price, diesel and unleaded combined, of $3.65. That's a little below where we are today. If you just kind of look at where we are through 2024, we're probably closer to a blended rate of around $3.40.
 So that's one of the call outs that we had in terms of the Q1 growth challenge. But we're not prognosticators of oil and the pull-through to fuel. We just look at EIA and other providers of those things. That was the consensus view of how the year would play out. I think as demand increases from a seasonal perspective, you would see that increase.
 Spreads, generally consistent with last year. That's really hard to predict. It's more based on volatility of fuel price, not just absolute. So that's kind of in base gas, but we look at historical trends and done some modeling, so we expect spreads to be relatively consistent. FX, a little bit of a tailwind. If the dollar and rate cuts continue -- the projection is correct and the dollar doesn't strengthen -- it had a little bit of strengthening over the last week or so, but longer term, we expect the dollar to be a little weaker, and so that will help the FX side of our business.
 And we think overall, that will be a slight tailwind to us. Rates, generally kind of neutral to better. We have modeled out the rate curve based on the latest rate curve out there. So we think rates will be a little bit better. Certainly interest expense lapping the headwind from this year in terms of the grow over from '22 will be a significant benefit to us.
 And then I guess, finally, taxes, we think will be generally consistent with the full year tax rate in 2023. So overall, we characterized the macro as kind of neutral to -- from a macro perspective, big macro perspective, and kind of a slight benefit to us with respect to things that affect us directly. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Sanjay, it's Ron. I got to jump in because I'm clearly the optimist here, playing off of Tom. But I'd say it's all -- it's sunshiny days, right, living through 2023 with a $200 million interest expense boat anchor and sitting here at the beginning of the year with half [ eFX ] and declining interest rates. It feels super great to get earnings print back to 15% or 18% that we can print instead of whatever we printed last year. So I would say that it's setting up at this moment to be super positive for us. Super happy with it. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Just a follow-up. Ron, you mentioned sort of the cross-sell initiatives in your prepared remarks. How much of that can happen over 2024? Is there anything baked in? And then when can we actually get the contribution in a significant way? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean it's happening in different places. I think you -- we've called out before, it's probably 20% of the Brazil sales now in the company are taking add-on products there and selling them back to the core base. We're underway with that, as I said, with the parking app because we've got millions of consumers. We're back -- reselling something back into the base of Corporate Payments, back into the fuel card base.
 So it's clearly in our sales plan. I'd say it's a probably relatively significant number as we get through the year in terms of what we're expecting there. So it's been a core part of the idea of we've got, as you know, 800,000 business clients, and some number of them are pretty big. And so having more things to offer them has always been part of the idea. So I think it's meaningful this year. 
Operator: The next question comes from Sheriq Sumar with Evercore ISI. 
Sheriq Sumar: I was looking at Slide 37, and I can see that the Corporate Payments take rate has increased in 2023. So just wanted to get some context as to what's the pricing power over here, and can we expect the same trajectory? I think that's the function of the adjustments that you have done by the segments. So just to get some insights on that. 
Thomas Panther: Sheriq, give me your page number again. You said 27? 
Sheriq Sumar: 37. 
Thomas Panther: 37. Okay, sorry. Yes, so a lot of that has to just do with the channel mix. So as Ron mentioned earlier, in terms of the way -- the amount of take rate we have on channel versus the direct business, as we saw the channel volume fluctuate in the quarter, that's what's causing the fluctuation in the take rate related to Corporate Payments. 
Sheriq Sumar: Got it. And my follow-up is on the margins. We see that the margins have been grinding higher across all the segments, and especially within the Vehicle Payments and Corporate Payments. So just to get a sense as to what could be the biggest driver in margins in 2024, like which segment do you expect to be a meaningful contributor? 
Thomas Panther: Yes. I don't think it's kind of disproportionate one way or another. Just kind of round it out, just to summarize, for the year, we were at 53%. We were exiting around 54%, and we guided for the full year 2024 to be at 54%, and probably exiting a little bit higher than that, as you would expect. And so it's not really one -- one, there's not a lot of change there. You're talking about, give or take, 100, 150 basis points.
 And secondly, I think it's more of the structure of the business that's driving the margin, not necessarily something that we're doing necessarily inside the business to modify the existing business model and the structure. So just as we grow at the levels at which each of the businesses are growing from a revenue and sales perspective and the amount of fixed cost, you're just going to get this natural operating leverage benefit from margin where you'll see that rotate up. So at the same time, we also want to continue to invest. 
 I guess, fair point. Yes, credit is coming down a little bit, '23 to '24, that would also help the margin. But the other thing just from the standpoint of just investment, we continue to make significant investments in the company, particularly around sales and marketing. And so we are mindful in terms of the amount of spend that we're putting back into the company to make sure that the sales engine can continue to generate the  kind of growth levels that we've historically generated. 
Operator: The next question comes from Cris Kennedy with William Blair. 
Cristopher Kennedy: I know you give the sample of the U.K. for unit economics of your EV business, but can you just talk broadly about that, how that's evolved over time and your confidence going forward in that? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Cris, it's Ron. So look, I preface it with it's still early days, I guess. We've been running this analysis for, what, 8 quarters or something and have 300 or 400 accounts in it. So look, we know a fair amount. We have real customers that are paying real bills and paying us more. I'd say to you that conceptually the reason that I think we can get paid the same or more, just to me simplistically, is there's just more purchase.
 So in the fuel business, let's say, in the U.K., there's 9,000 gas stations. We have 1 million drivers there. So someday, when every guy or gal has an EV, there's going to be 1 million incremental charge points. There's way more than 9,000 public charging points. And so the ability, again, to help a company make the transition from some old fashioned gas stations to some public charging to the million at home, bring that all together and keep it simple, is useful. In the scope of what they pay for charging and fuel, our fees are peanuts.
 And so it feels to me like we know what we're doing. And more importantly, we have products that they like. I think it doubled, Tom, year-over-year. And so I feel better about we've got the right solution, clients like it and clients are paying for it, and the math shows you they're paying more now than the old fashioned thing. So I'd say stop ringing the frigging fire alarms. It would be my comment to people. Hey, there's a lot of time in front of us, but I would not be super afraid, sitting here today. 
Operator: The next question is from Trevor Williams with Jefferies. 
Trevor Williams: I wanted to ask on Lodging. Any more detail you can give on some of the different components within the segment? It sounds like most of the incremental weakness was on the airline side. But any more color on the other pieces? Workforce, managed services, insurance, just how those did especially relative to Q3 would be helpful. 
Thomas Panther: Sure. Trevor, it's Tom. So the Lodging business, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, it did experience softness. Where our biggest surprise was for the quarter was really more on the airline and the insurance piece. We actually saw the workforce piece come in about where we had anticipated, and a lot of the expected growth that we had forecast in the fourth quarter was from what we've seen historically, with the level of flight cancelations related to our distressed product, where you typically would see a seasonal uptick. There's lots of people in the air with holidays and things like that. And that just didn't come to fruition.
 Similarly on the insurance side, we saw the decline in the overall insurance. So the decline quarter-over-quarter in lodging was really more directed towards those 2 businesses where those types of episodic-type things that occur in the fourth quarter just didn't materialize.  Workforce, we continue to see a little bit of softness there, but as Ron had indicated, we feel like that has [ topped ] out and expect that to move forward based on new sales and the introductions of the new products. 
Trevor Williams: Okay. No, that's helpful. And then just to put a finer point on the assumptions for the macro neutral or the organic guide. In terms of cadence, is the expectation that growth will accelerate progressively over the course of the year? So like you were saying with vehicle where Q1 low point, 4Q exit rate for '24 should be the high point of organic growth for the year? Or anything else to call out? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Trevor.  Let me try to take that and then Tom can add to it. So I mean, conceptually, the main reason is the same-store sales. So if you think about math, right, of how to get to 10%, right, we lose business, right, 8%. We make sales and then we have the same-store sales. And so the bet that we have, which we're seeing in the trends, is if the same store that was plus 2 4 quarters ago and was minus 3 this past quarter will head back to flat.
 And if that does, obviously, in that example, it lifts the organic thing by 3 points. So that's A. B, we think the retention, again, will likely tick up because of this micro flush. When you have more bigger accounts, you structurally just have better retention. And then third, our core repayments business is growing faster, and it has higher retention rates than our fuel card business.
 So those two things, as we model it, will help the back half. And then hopefully, the set of new products and the cross-sell stuff, which we're pouring out now, that will start to build, those add-ons will start to build in the back half. So that's what makes up the curve as we run through the year. 
Operator: The next question is from David Koning with Baird. 
David Koning: Just a couple of things. I guess, on the corporate line, you called out the yield mix improvement. But corporate volumes were down about 15% sequentially. It must have been low-yielding volumes that fell off. But what is the mix? What was the fall off in volumes from? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. It's just that channel thing that I said before. I mean, that literally was the point of our same-store sales reduction. We would have been 2% if that business was flat. So again, it's just a big partner that gives us lots of volume and no money goes, dates around and goes non-exclusive. And so, hey, we lose a little bit of revenue, and we lose a lot of volume.
 But the take rate goes up because obviously, that's a lot of low-margin business that we weren't getting. And we also know that excluding channel, the spend level was north of 25%. So it's really a channel story that's driving both the volume and the take rate noise that you may be seeing.
 But again, just to -- you said put a finer point on the thing, I want to make sure people have heard that we have the business to now contracted, right, for '24. So that helps us relay to you guys that we hit the bottom there, because when I look at what's effectively contracted, inside of the minimums we have, we're kind of done with that dating around. There's no more dating. If you date 1 or 2 people, you can't have any more than that. That's where it is. So that -- if there's any good news, that's the good news here. 
Thomas Panther: It's kind of belts and suspenders. It was also some minimums as well. So that we also got some protection that while we're under contract, we also have some commitments from a minimum perspective, too. 
David Koning: Got you. And just a quick follow-up. Bad debt expense, you called it out, I mean, lowest -- $22 million, lowest in 8 quarters or so. Is your 2024 guidance for that to remain low? And if so, is anything related to reversals? Like is it unsustainably low in 2024 or just normal? 
Thomas Panther: Yes, I mean I'd say it's fairly normal. Obviously, it's going to fluctuate from a dollar perspective as the business grows. We think of it more in terms of basis points of spend or percentage of revenue because as the business grows, you'd expect the bad debt dollar amount to grow, but not necessarily that rate to necessarily grow.
 So I think we'll continue to see good performance in 2024. We have -- plus the micro client that Ron said, we've tuned some of our models. We've gotten to a point where I think we've learned a lot over the last, call it, 6 quarters, and I think we'll be in a position where we can be a bit more opportunistic in terms of how we manage credit. 
Ronald F. Clarke: And again, just add the point is it helps the flow-through into earnings, right, although it looks like revenue is light when you take those late fees out because you're taking out the credit loss expense, basically, you have a decent flow-through down to EPS. So that's one of the reasons that the profit flow-through remain pretty good. 
Operator: The next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. 
Michael Infante: It's Mike Infante on for James. Just one quick one for me. On the buyback, anything that we should be mindful of just in terms of cadence there? Do you think it will be fairly evenly distributed based on seasonal free cash flow generation? Or will it be weighted to any particular quarter? 
Thomas Panther: Yes. Michael, it's Tom. I think we're going to be mindful in terms of market conditions, and we like where the stock price is. As I mentioned, we're flush with liquidity, both on the balance sheet and then when we upsized the revolver, we have another $600 million of liquidity. Obviously, we want to use some of that liquidity for M&A.
 But you add it all up, we have probably up to $2.5 billion, $3 billion worth of cash that we want to put to work, and we want to put it to work as quickly as possible. So I think the timing is just going to be predicated on the market, the amount of the floating stock and those types of things. But I think we will be looking to be in the market over the course of this quarter, and then we'll see how market conditions are as the year plays out. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session as well as the conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your line.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-11-08 17:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the FLEETCOR  Technologies, Inc. Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded on Wednesday, November 8, 2023. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Jim Eglseder, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
James Eglseder: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our third quarter 2023 earnings call. With me today are Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO; and Tom Panther, our CFO. Following the prepared comments, the operator will announce that the queue will open for the Q&A session. 
 Please note, our earnings release and supplement can be found under the Investor Relations section on our website at fleetcor.com. Throughout this call, we will be covering organic revenue growth. Now as a reminder, this metric neutralizes the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and fuel spreads. And it also includes pro forma results for acquisitions and divestitures or scope changes closed during the 2 years being compared. 
 We will also be covering non-GAAP financial metrics, including revenues, net income and net income per diluted share, all on an adjusted basis. These measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than at other companies. Reconciliations of the historical non-GAAP to the most directly comparable GAAP information can be found in today's press release and on our website. I need to remind everyone that part of today's discussion may include forward-looking statements. These statements reflect the best information we have as of today. All statements about our outlook, new products and expectations regarding business development and future acquisitions are based on that information. 
 They are not guarantees of future performance, and you should not put undue reliance upon them. We undertake no obligation to update any of these statements. The expected results are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K and in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available on our website and at sec.gov. 
 So now with that out of the way, I will turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay, Jim. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I appreciate you joining us today. Upfront here, I plan to cover 3 subjects: first, our financials, our Q3 results, our Q4 guidance and a brief 2024 preview. Second, I'll provide an update on our strategic review and where we're coming out. And then lastly, I'll introduce our fleet transformation plan, which is aimed at accelerating the revenue growth of that business. Okay. 
 Let me begin with our Q3 results, which were generally in line with our expectations. We reported revenue of $971 million, up 9%, and cash EPS of $4.49, up 6% versus last year. But it would have been up 16% at constant interest rates. Q3 macro, weaker than our August outlook. Our fuel spreads contracted about 25% in the quarter, and that was the result of a $0.50 fuel price point-to-point increase from the Q2 exit to the Q3 exit, which compresses fuel spreads. 
 Look, despite this weaker macro, our Q3 earnings powered through. We actually finished a few cents ahead of our August guide if you exclude just the Russia and PayByPhone transactions. Overall, organic revenue growth for Q3, up 10%. Inside of that, our Corporate Payments business maintained its 20% growth rate. So super pleased there. 
 Our pivot, which we started last year in North America fuel away from new super small micro accounts clearly paid dividends this quarter. Our North America fuel credit losses went in half from about $24 million last year to $12 million this year. 
 Trends in the quarter are generally quite good. Continued strong demand for our products. Our new sales, up 17% versus prior year, so very good. Retention remaining stable across the enterprise at 91%. Our same-store sales did soften a bit, from flat last quarter to kind of minus 1 this quarter. We did notice pretty noticeable softening in our managed services subsegment in Lodging, which we're digging into. 
 Our Q3 EBITDA reached $529 million, $529 million, an all-time record high for the company, held by EBITDA margins, which expanded to 54.5%. That's up about 200 basis points versus last year. So all in all, I'd say a pretty good Q3 performance. Okay. 
 Let me make the turn to our updated Q4 guidance, which reflects a couple of changes in scope, so the Russia divestiture, which we mentioned last time, and the recent PayByPhone acquisition. We've also refreshed the Q4 macro, which is outlooking a bit weaker FX than we saw in August. 
 So look, despite these adjustments and these pressures, the fundamentals, quite good such that our underlying Q4 profit guide is actually a bit stronger than our view 90 days ago. You can see on Page 14 in our earnings supplement that refreshed bridge. 
 So we're updating Q4 guidance today to $968 million in revenue at the midpoint and $4.49 in cash EPS at the midpoint. So really, right on top of our Q3 print. Here again, historically, Q3 and Q4 results have been very similar. This updated Q4 guide implies a 10% organic revenue growth in the quarter and a 14% EBITDA growth. So again, the forecast, really spot on to our [ 10-13-19 ] compounding model. 
 Okay. Let me transition to our preliminary view of 2024, which I characterize the setup is quite encouraging. So we're outlooking the 2024 macro environment to be neutral to maybe slightly positive. And that's simply looking at the various macro factors as they exit this year into next year. Revenue, we're outlooking, again, although early, organic revenue growth in the same 9% to 11% range. That's consistent with prior years. And then lastly, kind of the key profit drivers of the business generally setting up favorably. So we're expecting lower bad debt, flat to lower interest expense, and a stable tax rate and share count. So generally, a good setup. So look, although it's early days in our '24 planning, I'd say we generally like what we see. All right. 
 Let me shift gears and provide an update on our strategic review. As a reminder, the goal of our strategic review or portfolio review is really twofold: so first, to make a simpler company; and then second, to evaluate separation options to increase shareholder value. 
 On the simplification front, we've done a few things. We've sold Russia. We decided to keep our prepaid business although we are working a couple of other non-core asset sales. And we're moving to 3 primary reporting segments, all of these things to make a simpler company. On the separation front, we've concluded not to pursue a pure spin, and that's mainly looking at RemainCo derating risk. 
 We've also decided not to pursue a strategic sale. Primarily, they are due to tax leakage and our estimate of dis-synergies. But we are continuing to evaluate a couple separation alternatives with [ dance ] partners that we think are potentially pretty attractive. So we do expect to conclude those discussions with the counter-parties over the next 90 days, and we'll certainly report back then. Okay. 
 My last subject is to introduce our fleet transformation plan, which we believe is the single most important thing, effort to unlock shareholder value and re-rate our stock. So the objective of the fleet transformation plan is to accelerate our global Fleet business growth in the double digits, so that we have 3 big primary businesses that can all target double-digit revenue growth. We have prepared a few slides in our lengthy earnings supplement beginning on Page 22 to help walk you through how we intend to accelerate fleet growth. 
 The plan really centers around 3 big ideas. So first, BAU. On the BAU front, we plan to get at performance improvement through new fleet products, which we're leasing into the market now. And these products join up with our corporate payment products to really create a differentiated offering in the marketplace. As you may recall, we're also pivoting that business from kind of small micro prospects to a bit larger seam prospects, both from repointing our digital marketing machine and adding additional field and Zoom reps targeted at this slightly larger market segment. The emphasis will be on two primary verticals. Those are field services and construction, both of which are big significant opportunities. 
 Second, underpinning for the plan is EV. We believe we can capitalize on the EV transition. We're getting much more confident that our 3-in-1 commercial fleet EV-ICE solution is really is a winner and that we can maintain or maybe even increase our fleet revenues throughout the transition. So early experience in the U.K. over the last 11 quarters bears this out. Revenue per EV vehicle running higher than revenue per ICE vehicle. So again, pretty positive. 
 Then lastly, is this idea of a consumer vehicle payments business versus just the B2B vehicle payments business. And so the idea is to further expand on that front and really just leverage the networks, the payment networks, the merchant relationships we have, that we built on the B2B side over the last 20 years. So the idea would be we start with anchor apps. So think toll tags in Brazil or digital parking in the U.K. that have millions of active mobile users and then offer additional vehicle payment-related solutions that utilize our payment networks. So for example, utilize our EV network or utilize our service repair network. 
 We've demonstrated success in this approach in Brazil. Over 60% of our active consumer toll users now use a second or even third payment solution like parking or insurance. So we think, pretty exciting. Additionally, this consumer vehicle payments push does open up additional interesting acquisition targets. For example, PayByPhone and literally other ones as well. 
 So look, we believe that we have the potential to incrementally drive the overall fleet/vehicle business into double-digit territory via these 3 ideas. So again, kind of new fleet products, combined with corporate payment products targeted to a couple of big verticals, success in the EV transition and the build-out of a big billion dollar consumer vehicle payments business, clearly well underway in Brazil, and then we hope to accelerate with this PayByPhone acquisition. 
 You can actually see our forecast math, the build to $1 billion, on Page 29 of the supplement. This anticipates that this expanded consumer vehicle leg growing fast can pull a low single-digit core fleet card business into double-digit growth territory. So literally, maybe 12%. 
 So look, in conclusion, today, we're forecasting 2023 pretty much where we started out in February of this year. In and around $17 of cash EPS. That's despite selling Russia and having a bit unfavorable macro. '24 outlook early, but I'd say encouraging. Still busy on some active separation, discussions with some counter-parties. We expect to conclude that in 90 days. And then lastly, this fleet transformation plan, we think, quite exciting. We believe it has the potential to reaccelerate the Fleet business and really potentially lift the entire enterprise to faster growth. So with that, let me turn the call back over to Tom to provide some additional detail on the quarter. Tom? 
Thomas Panther: Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. Here are some additional details related to the quarter. Let me start by acknowledging that it was an active quarter with the sales of the Russia business, the acquisition of PayByPhone and significant movements in fuel prices and FX rates. I'll address the impact from each of these factors to better compare our actual results to our previous guidance. 
 First, our prior guidance included a full year of revenue and earnings from the Russia fuel business. Based on the August 15 closing date and final cash proceeds, the disposition of Russia resulted in $12 million of lower revenue and $0.06 of lower cash EPS. Secondly, the acquisition of PayByPhone on September 15 added $2 million of revenue and was $0.01 dilutive to adjusted earnings. 
 Turning to the macro headwinds in the quarter. Compared to the assumptions used for our guidance in August, the total negative impact was $17 million. Average fuel prices of $3.88 were 7% higher during the quarter, resulting in a $4 million benefit. However, it's important to note the point-to-point increase in fuel price from July 1 to September 30 was around $0.50. The majority of this 15% increase occurred in August and plateaued for the remainder of the quarter. Underlying that rapid increase in the retail fuel price was an even greater increase in wholesale fuel costs, which compressed fuel spreads approximately 25%, compared to our forecast, adversely affecting revenue by $13 million. So the net impact from changes in fuel prices on revenue was a $9 million headwind. 
 It's typical when fuel prices rapidly increase for spreads to compress due to wholesale fuel prices increasing faster than retail prices, which can overwhelm the fuel price increase benefit. We get asked regularly, if there's a way to track the price and spread impact. We found that OPIS or the Oil Price Information Service, which is a subscription-based provider, does a good job depicting retail and wholesale fuel prices and the resulting spread. 
 Now turning to FX rates. The significant strengthening of the dollar beginning in August, when the Fed's tone became more hawkish, caused the dollar to strengthen relative to our foreign currencies, resulting in an $8 million drag on revenue. 
 In summary, if we knew in early August what we know now about these factors I just discussed, our guide would have been revenue of $963 million and cash EPS of $4.33 per share compared to our reported results of $971 million and $4.49 per share. The majority of the $8 million revenue beat came from our international businesses. Our earnings out-performance is particularly impressive because the flow-through of our revenue results, combined with our strong expense management and lower bad debt expense, enabled us to power through the macro headwind and still exceed our pro forma August cash EPS guidance, when adjusting only for the impact from Russia and PayByPhone. We've included Slide 7 in our earnings supplement that walks you through these moving parts. 
 Now on to more details regarding our results for the quarter, focusing on year-over-year revenue growth. Organic revenue growth was 10%, reflecting the diversification of our business and the realization of the strong sales that we've produced throughout the year. Year-over-year, lower fuel prices resulted in a $12 million reduction in revenue, and lower fuel price spreads reduced revenue by $23 million. FX rates were favorable relative to last year, translating into a $15 million benefit. So net-net, a $20 million macro headwind versus last year. Putting aside the macro noise in comparison to our prior guidance, GAAP revenue increased 9%, which reflects the business' ability to consistently deliver solid revenue growth. 
 Corporate Payments revenue was up 20%, driven by 20% growth in spend. Strength in our direct business, which grew over 30%, was again led by outstanding growth in full AP. Our comprehensive menu of high-quality payment solutions continues to sell extremely well, up 28% as we sign up new customers who are looking to modernize their AP operations. We also continue to expand our proprietary merchant network and increase the amount of cardable spend. Cross-border revenue was up 19% as sales also grew 28% and recurring client transaction activity was robust. We are the largest nonbank FX provider in the world, and the name recognition we now have is a real advantage when we compete for our clients' business. More importantly, our best-in-class capabilities, service and products allow us to have market-leading retention and client acquisition, which you can see in our results. 
 Turning to our Fleet business. Organic revenue increased 4%. We experienced strength in our international markets. And in the U.K., we are pleased with the continued strong sales performance of our 3-in-1 product offering, which customers find very attractive as they add EVs to their fleet. In the U.S., some softness in small fleet, in addition to the impact from our shift away from micro clients, are affecting our sales and overall results. Our shift to higher-credit quality clients also impacted late fees, which were down 21% from Q3 2022. While the decline in late fees results in a drag on our revenue growth, it has been more than offset by a decline in bad debt expense, which I'll comment on later. But it's important to point out that our decision to pivot up market has been EBITDA positive. 
 Lastly, as Ron mentioned, we continue to refine our go-to-market strategy to acquire larger customers and we are excited about the rollout of additional products that we expect will drive a significant uplift in sales heading into next year and going forward. 
 Before I move on, Ron addressed the PayByPhone acquisition and how it fits into our fleet transformation strategy. To give you some deal specifics, PayByPhone is the world's second largest global parking payments platform, with over 6 million monthly active users on its mobile app. Their network covers approximately 4 million parking spaces primarily in North America, the U.K. and Europe, and they process over 200 million transactions annually, totaling $900 million in spend. We paid approximately $300 million for the company and expect to realize about $50 million in revenue next year. 
 Now to Brazil, where revenue grew 16% compared to last year, driven by 7% tag growth. Our tag growth enables us to further increase the proportion of revenue from our expanded network of products where we earn incremental revenue. In the quarter, approximately 35% of customer spend was from our expanded network. Fuel is a great example of how we're expanding our product network with the number of tag-enabled gas stations growing 25% and transactions up over 40%. Our extensive network enabled us to generate 20% sales growth in the quarter over the prior year with almost 30% of the sales coming from non-tag products. Our success in Brazil is a tangible proof point of our broader vehicle payment strategy, where we leverage an anchor product used by a large customer base to deliver additional products and services driving incremental revenue growth. 
 Lastly, we've received some questions over the last several quarters about the potential impact of the Brazilian government deploying free-flow tolling, where the toll station reads the license plate and the individual pays the toll after the fact by going to a website. Now that these free-flow stations have been in place for a few years, our experience is that we actually sell more tags when these toll stations are installed because the tag user receives a small discount and is able to pay the toll automatically via their tag. This frictionless customer experience drives incremental demand for our product. 
 Lodging revenue increased 10% against a tough prior year Q3 comp where the business had grown 28%. It's not unusual for the business to have quarterly revenue growth fluctuations driven by weather and natural disaster variability. Year-to-date, the business is up 16%. This quarter's performance was highlighted by sales success across our industry verticals. In addition to revenue per night, which increased 20%, driven primarily from channel and product mix, namely from our distressed passenger product and higher hotel commission revenue. Offsetting that to some degree was softness in our construction and transportation verticals as the weaker macroeconomic environment is impacting these sectors. We expect this softness to rebound as the economic outlook becomes clear. 
 Before leaving the segments, I want to briefly comment on our expectation to move to 3 primary business segments. We're making this change in how we operate the company in the fourth quarter and reflect the new segments in our 10-K. 
 Now looking further down the income statement. Operating expenses of $526 million represent a 4% increase versus Q3 of last year, driven by acquisitions, increases tied to higher transaction and sales activities, and investments to drive future growth, partially offset by lower FX rates and the sale of our Russia business. 
 Bad debt expense declined 22% from last year to $29 million or 6 basis points of spend. Within that, fleet bad debt expense was down $15 million year-over-year as we realized the benefit from lower exposure to micro clients as previously discussed. EBITDA margin in the quarter was 54.5%, a 225 basis point improvement from the third quarter of last year. After normalizing for the Russia sale, we still expect our full year EBITDA margin to exit this year 200 to 250 basis points better than the prior year. This positive operating leverage is driven by solid revenue growth, lower bad debt expense, disciplined expense management and synergies realized from recent acquisitions. 
 Interest expense increased $43 million year-over-year, driven by the increase in SOFR on our debt stack and higher debt balances driven by acquisitions. The impact of higher interest rates resulted in an approximate $0.44 drag on Q3 adjusted EPS. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.6% versus 26.8% last year. 
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in unrestricted cash and we had $660 million available on our revolver. We have $5.6 billion outstanding on our credit facilities, and we had $1.4 billion borrowed under our securitization facility. 
 As of September 30, our leverage ratio was 2.66x trailing 12-month EBITDA as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement. We repurchased 2 million shares in the quarter for $530 million, including the ASR we announced in conjunction with the Russia sale. And we have over $700 million authorized for share repurchases. We have ample liquidity to pursue near-term M&A opportunities, and we'll continue to buy back shares when it makes sense. 
 Now turning to our guidance. Let me start by bridging the implied Q4 guidance we provided in August to reflect the acquisition and divestiture activity during the quarter and current macro environment. The sale of the Russia business would reduce revenue by $30 million, and the acquisition of PayByPhone would increase revenue by $10 million. We're now expecting a $20 million macro headwind versus what we thought back in August, driven primarily by worse FX rates, partially offset by higher fuel prices of $3.96. Making these pro forma adjustments to our prior Q4 guide lowers revenue to $968 million and adjusted earnings per share to $4.34 per share at the midpoint. We've included Slide 14 in the earnings presentation that lays out these factors. 
 With that pro forma reference point established, let me comment on our Q4 outlook that includes the factors I just mentioned. We're expecting revenue to be between $953 million and $983 million, representing 10% growth versus last year at the midpoint. And we expect adjusted net income per share to be between $4.34 and $4.64 per share, which, at the midpoint, is up 11% over what we reported in Q4 2022. So similar to the third quarter, we expect to generate solid year-over-year revenue and earnings growth despite some softening economic conditions in our markets. Based on this Q4 guidance, for the full year, we now expect GAAP revenues between $3.774 billion and $3.804 billion, adjusted net income between $1.252 billion and $1.276 billion, adjusted net income per diluted share between $16.82 and $17.12 per share, and EBITDA growth of 14% and EBITDA margin of 53%. 
 Thank you for your interest in FLEETCOR. And now operator, we'd like to open the line for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Good results in a tough backdrop here. Ron, could you give us a little bit more color on the strategic actions you're considering in this spin-or-merge scenario with these [ dance ] partners? Maybe you can just speak to what certain permutations might be? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Sure, Sanjay. So it's really mostly in around our Corporate Payments business. And so we have a couple of interesting counter-parties where we might separate something and actually have a pure play that has more scale and synergies and stuff. And so we're kind of in the final mile of working through those conversations and seeing whether there's something there. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Understood. And then sort of appreciate the preliminary organic revenue outlook for next year. I guess when we think about the different variables from a macro standpoint, whether it be the economy and then obviously FX and such, can you just give us a sense of sort of where we're at with that? Like what are you guys baking into that organic growth in terms of backdrop, the macro backdrop? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I think generally, the comment I gave is comp. So if you look at the various macro factors and the way we're exiting both fuel price spreads, FX, et cetera, I'd say that sitting here today, it feels like kind of a neutral-ish to maybe a smidge positive. And so obviously, our organic stuff puts that to the side, right, that it is between print and organic. But I'd say I did want to just provide a bit of a preview that unlike this year, Sanjay, with interest rates up, whatever, 400 basis points, that the grow over basically across some of our key profit levers looks quite good. So the setup looks way more normalized than it has in the last couple of years. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: I know you guys covered a lot here. I wanted to ask on the -- maybe for you, Ron, just on the consumer vehicle payments, the $1 billion that you're talking about '27. Do you have the assets you need today to get to that $1 billion? And do you expect the margin profile at that time to be different since this is a consumer or CDP business as you called out? 
Ronald F. Clarke: It's a great question. Good to talk. We can only get into this debate, Tien-Tsin, tonight. So yes, we've got a couple, I'd say, of additional transactions that we're looking at to fill out a couple of the product lines. But this is -- I don't know how clear I was in it, but mostly an organic play where we get -- we use basically these big consumer active blocks, right, of accounts and just match it up with what we already have, right, which is the payment network and the merchants. And so the million dollar question there, Tien-Tsin, is just that velocity. So when we show 2 million people some additional related things, what's the take rate going to be? So I'd say that most of the thinking, both studying what we've done in Brazil and obviously studying this deal, the view is that it's organic.
 And the key, as you heard me talk a million times, is cost of sales. That's the key to growth and profitability. And so the good news is our view is we're not going to do tons of marketing. Hey, let's go out and spend gazillions of dollars, but rather try to light up big bases. So I'd say we like the EBITDA profile basically and getting that thing to go. So a couple more deals and mostly organic, that's the game plan. 
Thomas Panther: Yes. And Tien-Tsin, we wouldn't expect it to be margin dilutive. Again, look at Brazil as our bellwether. It has attractive margins across the rest of our portfolio. So we think that's a good indicator of what the overall business can be as it expands. 
Ronald F. Clarke: To add on to tension, as you know, we're always lower cost, right, than new, new accounts. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Sure. No, I like it. I mean it's exciting. I think getting into the consumer side and getting the synergies there make a lot of sense. Just curious on the cost side, as you called out, but I'm sure you're thoughtful about that. And I'm glad to hear that it's in your margin zone. Just on the -- my follow-up then, just the 3 business lines and the cleaning up the reporting segments. I know we're going to get more. But is the general idea that it's going to be Corpay, vehicle payments and, I suppose lodging? And can you give us an idea on the margin differences between the three? Because I think as we're thinking about our own sum of the parts, I know there are a lot of different views on the profitability across those three. But is there any high-level thoughts that you can share on that? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Let me start, Tien-Tsin, just on the segments, yes. So segment one will be vehicle, which will be our global Fleet business, our Brazil business and then honestly, really, this consumer, which is a big part of the Brazil thing today, so the PayByPhone and the other things would be in that. Second business, obviously, Corporate Payments and then third business, Lodging. So those would be the three lines. 
Thomas Panther: Yes. And for your modeling, we're really just combining Fleet and Brazil today. And so based on how we report operating income and how you may model the business at a more detailed level, it would just be a simple summation of those two. We wouldn't anticipate any type of shift in the margin profile. It's just bringing those two together into the vehicle payments segment. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. 
Darrin Peller: I mean sticking to just the current -- the segment themselves from this past quarter, they were strong in the Corpay side. And then suddenly, you hear that's such an important part of the strategic thinking going forward. But Ron, I'd love to just hear what you see going well there. There's obviously a lot of competitive chatter going on around macro headwinds, some debating structural changes. So just talk to us a little more about your strategic plans on that segment before any real mergers or anything else. Just standalone, what's going well? What do you anticipate it to look like over the next year? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Good question, Darrin. Mostly everything, right, is going well to post, I don't know how many quarters now, 20%. But quite a few from where I'm looking at going forward. And I think the sales inside of the 17% were in the mid-to-high 20s for that line of business, so that tells us that we're selling a lot. There's a lot of demand. In terms of what's working well and not well today, everything is working well with the exception of that channel business, which we've spoken of.
 So again, that thing continues to decline but will become, as you know, a much smaller part of the total, which implies again that the direct business is growing closer to 25% to 30%. So look, as I said before, we spent whatever the last couple of years assembling stuff, right, software, getting scale, getting more scale across border. And now the game is really marketing and sales. We put the brand out a while ago. We've added head count as you see in the sales growth rate. So that's the game now. It's really just to drive new sales faster and get those implemented. And unlike some other people have reported, to your point, because we're a middle market, the book is pretty stable, right? Our same-store sales look stable exiting the quarter, so we're not seeing any of that. 
Thomas Panther: We haven't seen erosion on the supplier level either. We continue to see good network expansion. Cardable spend continues to gradually move up. So the interest level from the merchant side and the supplier side continues to be favorable. 
Darrin Peller: That's really helpful color. Ron, just a quick follow-up to the prepaid business decision. Just maybe just take a step back on why you decided to keep that now? And are there any other non-core assets that do make sense to sell potentially? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Good follow-up. I think ultimately, Darrin, we just like the business more than some of the people that looked at it. So when you look at the tax leakage and dilution from that, I'd say that we spent a lot of time making that a better business than when we shopped it 3 years ago. And so the premium that we were looking for about what it's worth today, right, to pay the tax, I think people didn't get close enough to where we or I wanted to see the thing. So we feel good enough to hold it.
 With that said, as part of this review, we went through all the other kind of small non-core things. So we do have 2 kind of non-core things that we're kind of actively talking to buyers about. So there's a couple of hanging chads left there. But both that and the broader counter-party thing, we will have mopped up when we come back to you in 90 days. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. 
Ramsey El-Assal: I have a quick follow-up on the consumer, the new consumer business. How should we think about that from kind of a geographic perspective? Is it a plan that you're kind of going to execute sort of all over the place, depending on whether helpful assets become available in key geographies? Or are you focused just on the U.S. or Europe? Or how are you looking at that? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Look, great question, Ramsey. So if you step back, our current business is really in 3 markets, 3 countries, call it, 90% of the company. Right here, Brazil and the U.K., so that would be the answer. So we're -- of the $1 billion target, we're, I don't know, $350 million or $400 million consumer payment business in Brazil today and close to 0, right, in the U.K. and the U.S. And so part of this PayByPhone idea was to get a big customer base in the U.K. and in the U.S. where we already have these networks again was the idea. So there's no plan, for Tien-Tsin's other question, for us to go fire a young man to far away places and to try to build a business where we don't have networks and management and stuff. So Brazil, U.K., U.S., in that order, is how we're thinking about it. 
Ramsey El-Assal: All right. Makes a ton of sense. And one follow-up. On the Lodging segment, you called out the tough year-over-year comparison this quarter. Also mentioned some softening in a subvertical. I think it was managed services. Just trying to think through how to model that out next quarter. The comp gets easier, but did the headwinds you're seeing in that managed services sort of subvertical stick around? Or should we expect more of a bounce back on the easier comp next quarter? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Good question. And unclear, I'd say. We thought -- I think I called this out because we started to see it in Q2. So again, let me go to the top and maybe this will be helpful. So inside of our Lodging business, we serve, call it, 4 or 5 different customer subsegments. So we do things like airlines, insurance, railroads, construction, things like that. So one of those segments is kind of this project-based segment. So think like consulting firms, retail merchandising people, environmental companies. It's only, I don't know, Ramsey, 300 to 400 clients in it. But they field pretty big teams of people. They go to places and stay for a while. So maybe 10 people go to a city and stay there for 2 or 3 weeks. So that's the nature of the business.
 So literally starting in Q2 and more in Q3, say 50 out of those 300 clients just start to go like super soft. So when we call them, they would say things like, oh, hey, Walmart, who's a big client for merchandising, moved that in-house. They're not using our third-party company to go there and do merchandising in their stores. Or hey, a couple of our construction clients flipped over to using some local contractors instead of their own people. So I'd say we're just not really sure. The good news is the other segments, we don't see it. It's mostly resident kind of in this one place. So I think we've printed, what Tom, 10% organic. So that thing actually went backwards, that [ managing ] a bit, while obviously, the rest of the businesses went forward. So we're kind of outlooking, Ramsey, the thing to kind of stay softish here in Q4. And then obviously, we hope to get a better idea when we make a turn in the next year. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Peter Christiansen from Citi. 
Peter Christiansen: Ron, I'm just curious now that you're through a good portion of the strategic review, and it seems like you certainly have a team set up for the next couple of quarters. Just curious on your thoughts on the use of share repurchase, leverage levels? And then secondary to that, how are you generally thinking about the trade-off between margin and growth here? Do you see an opportunity to invest? Maybe perhaps accelerate growth a bit more? Get more behind sales? Just curious on your thoughts on those relationships. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Good question, Pete. So I'd say it's been a pretty busy and active, whatever it's been, 6 or 9 months strategic review. So look, the good news in it is when you put out an ad like that, it does generate incremental activity. So we do have, as I said, not only some separation discussions still going. But we've surfaced some additional M&A targets that are kind of interesting in and around the same space as people look to the phone. So look, I think our priorities around capital and leverage are kind of the same. Our target is 3. I think we're running, I don't know, 2.5 or 2.6.  We're buyers of our stock. Obviously, at this price, if we grow 9% to 11% next year, we grow the bottom faster. That's a 10x EBITDA multiple for company compounding in the team. So we're buyers of our stock. Let's say, 3x leverage, we'll go higher. 
 For a deal, we do have again a few interesting things in this consumer space that have surfaced and a couple in our core Corporate Payments base that we're chasing. So like always, I'd say, those will be the two main uses. I think we'll generate, I don't know, low $1 billion to $1.3 billion-ish. I think it's in our early look at next year, plus we've got leverage still, right, where we're sitting today. And the EBITDA will grow next year. So a handful of deals and buy our stock back would be the order. 
Peter Christiansen: And then longer-term growth versus margin, are you coming out any differently post the review or as you go through the progress -- process? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, good question. So if you look at our print for 3 quarters and even into our guide, I think we've stepped up sequentially, as we said, right? EBITDA margin, I think I quoted between 54% and 55% this quarter. And I think Tom and I look at it kind of the same number for Q4. We kind of looked at our plan for next year, similarly, which gives us a little more money because we've kind of gone past some of these capability acquisitions. So I'd say we'll ramp up the sales and marketing investments a bit but look, initially at least, to try to keep the exit of our margin kind of between 54% and 55% as kind of the target for next year. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Mihir Bhatia from Bank of America. 
Mihir Bhatia: The first question I had, I just wanted to go back to the fleet product transformation, so fleet segment transformation strategy. And on point one, where you talk about the Fuel+ business card, I wanted to ask a little bit more, if you could talk a little bit more about that. How is that different than the Beyond Fuel strategy that I think you all had a couple of years ago? I'm just trying to understand what kind of growth, et cetera, you expect that strategy to drive? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. It's a good question. So let me start by saying that most of the competition for the prospects that we're trying to get are on business cards. So in the older days, there was cash and house accounts and other things. And now when we look at the customers that we want to have that we don't have, many are on business cards. And some of those are on our competitors' fuel cards as well. And so the idea is really to go to new accounts with a combined -- effectively, a business card and a fuel card in one. So -- and target that against verticals that use fuel cards that have people in the field. Think of like field services like HVAC or construction, things like that.
 And so that's the basic idea that we've now wrapped -- I don't if you guys remember, we bought a company about 2 years ago called Roger that we re-branded as Corpay One. So we've wrapped all that technology now around a business card, so that it's mobile-centric kind of automated expense capture and stuff around the business card, and then connected that to our proprietary fuel card capabilities and networks. And so what you've got is a business card that's a little more high tech than some of the bank cards, combined to a fuel card that has controls and advantaged economics, and it's bundled into kind of one package and one account.
 And so the testing on it has been super duper good, and we're literally in the market selling the products now. So the biggest difference, I'd say, is the focus. It's new accounts versus back to the base. It's in a couple of verticals. And the product has been revamped or rewrapped with kind of some modern technology. 
Mihir Bhatia: Got it. And then just -- well, maybe just switching back to the Corporate Payments segment for a second. And it's a little bit of a repeat of earlier question about just what is driving that strength that you were seeing? Like I appreciate that you are a little bit more mid-market. But some of the factors like just macro slowdown or large suppliers choosing to push back or not accept virtual card payments seem like that shouldn't be as big of an issue, whether you're small or medium, whether your customers are small or medium.
 And I was just wondering, are there particular areas of strength in that Corporate Payments segment that you would call out? I'm just trying to understand a little bit about what's really driving so much strength for you guys. Or has it just been a lot of new sales? What's driving that? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean, I think you can see it a bit in the KPIs that it's volume. I mean it's really not rate. So in the 2 big businesses there, the payables business and the FX business, it's volume and it's what you said. I think I just quoted it that in Q3, again, I think the sales of those businesses were up 28% year-over-year over the prior, and we had a blockbuster first half. So you've got this huge implementation backlog effectively of new volume, new business that's coming on the books, which helps give us the predictability. A lot of the sales we're making in this quarter or next quarter will obviously be implemented in the spring and the summer next year.
 So it's not really complicated. We finally are off humpty-dumpty work of putting a competitive set of offerings together and have made the turn really into marketing and selling them, and they're doing a great job at it. So I think it's pretty straightforward. And then B, we're getting leverage in that business on the profit side. I think, Tom -- it's looking about $1 billion ballpark, call it $1 billion per year in revenue.
 And so the scale of the business now and compounding at 20% the incremental revenue, the flow-through margins are 75% to 80% on that stuff. So it's obviously increasing the EBITDA margin. So it's just -- it's in a good spot. It's a giant TAM, and so the game is to just keep chasing, chasing hard after it, because we finally have what we need there. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of [ Nick Pramo ] from UBS. 
Unknown Analyst: Congrats on the strong quarter. I just wanted to ask about how the sales pipeline has been trending in the Fleet business with the pivot to larger customers and how that informs the 2024 outlook for the Fleet business when paired with the new products that you plan to roll out. 
Ronald F. Clarke: It's Ron. So happening, I'd say, a little slower than we'd like but happening. So again, it's -- I guess, we're about a year into the pivot. I can't remember how clear I said it, but it's worked, right? In Q3, the credit losses in that business went in half from $24 million to $12 million, and our outlook for this quarter Q4 is $25 million going to $10 million, so down $15 million. We have traded a bit of late fee revenue, right, because we don't have those small accounts that are going later or obviously going bad. So I'd say that it's in process. It's been pretty complicated to turn that digital engine to bigger accounts to make sure that they're creditworthy and that the algorithm is working. But we're seeing I think, as I mentioned, sequentially an increase in the what we call [ above-5 ] card market there.
 And then second, we started building the field and Zoom staff that will contact -- that will be outbound, if you will, on that a bit larger seam than the micros. So I'd say that we're moving some investment dollars along with pivoting the digital engine. So the plan is for it to pick up a lot. I don't have it in front of me, but I think our sales plan for that line of business here in the U.S. is up 25% next year on the back of that of, one, the digital pivot and, two, the incremental field sellers. 
Thomas Panther: Yes. And I wouldn't also lose sight of the international business. It continues to sell quite well. Year-to-date, 10-plus percent levels of sales growth. So that also helps generate the overall fleet performance that you're seeing. 
Unknown Analyst: That's very helpful color, and great to see the credit loss is down substantially. For my follow-up question, I just wanted to touch on PayByPhone. I'm sorry if this was already addressed. But what's the margin profile and revenue growth profile of that business on a standalone basis? And how much opportunity do you see on the expense side to optimize there? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, there is no margin profile in that business, right? That's been a go-go growth business compounding, I don't know, 20% to 25% the last 3 years in their preliminary plan standalone into next year. Into '24, it's another 25%. It's circa, call it, $50 million next year, call it, $40 million this year, pro forma, going to $50 million, kind of earning virtually nothing. So the -- again, the big idea is what we can do with it, right, which are two things. One, we've got a ton of businesses that are already -- the employees are already using their app here in the United States and in the U.K. So we're obviously going to go to our business clients and hopefully dramatically increase the amount of B2B parking that the company has instead of "consumer parking" where FYI, the rate is substantially better if you're working for a business.
 And then the second one, I think, we said is we have networks they don't have, right? Beyond parking, we have EV, we have service. We have registrations and fines and compliance kinds of things. And so the idea is, obviously, to try to light up their customers who are in the app making payments where, remember, we got the information. It's Ron Clarke, he's on his iPhone, his license plate is XYZ, he's on his Mastercard. The data that we need to add an EV recharge is kind of in the account when we show up. So we expect the synergy, if you will, to take that thing into positive territory, right, as we head into 2024. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli from William Blair. 
Robert Napoli: A lot there, a lot there tonight to go through. Just Ron, the separation alternatives, merging with someone else, is that -- I mean, essentially, would that -- given the size of your business, is that essentially going to be FLEETCOR Corporate Payments acquiring somebody and then merging into a public company? Or I mean, what's -- just any thoughts around how that would -- could work, what you're thinking about there? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Bob, good to hear your voice. So obviously, there's a few different flavors that we're working on depending on who the counter-party is. There's actually a pretty fascinating structure that we're looking at where we could spin out an asset of ours effectively into a private entity and have someone else combine their assets into the same private entity. We would obviously control and own some fair amount of that company. So we'd consolidate it, work on the synergies, and then basically IPO that a different day. We're looking at another scenario where we would literally put our asset into another company. So there's a few different combinations.
 And it really is just a function of how accretive, what kind of premium we think we could get by separating something and combining it which, again, makes a lot more sense to us than the "pure spin" where we're kind of guessing at pro forma multiple. So we've been in conversations with a few people for quite a while, and we're trying to figure out whether the thing makes sense or not. 
Robert Napoli: Interesting. Just a follow-up on Corporate Payments. The 20% organic growth is really impressive given the size. Is that something that is sustainable into next year? And is it the AP side or the cross-border FX? You've made a number of acquisitions there. What is outperforming more? Maybe relative size of the key pieces of Corporate Payments? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Another good question. They're kind of 60-40 in terms of revenue, but they're both kind of compounding around the same level. And I'd say early days, without Ron pushing too hard, I'd say next year is high teens to [ 20% ] again. More to do to give you that final number. But I think -- yes, I think we believe, given the sales again that we got in the Q and the backlog that come online next year. And then we've got a couple of monetization ideas to get more card, if you will, with some of the accounts. So I think it's -- even though it's big, I think we feel good about the thing just keep getting up and going again next year. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Nate Svensson from Deutsche Bank. 
Christopher Svensson: I just wanted to double-click on organic growth within the fleet period a little bit. So if you take Russia out from all periods, it looks like organic growth was relatively flat at 3% this quarter. So can you give a little geographic detail on what drove that 3% growth? I know last quarter, you called out Mexico and Australia. So just wondering what happened this quarter, what deals grew well, which may have grown a little softer. Within that, how did the monthly trends progress as we moved through the third quarter? And then moving into the fourth quarter, should we expect that organic growth ex Russia to stay roughly flat at around 3%? 
Thomas Panther: Nate, I'll take that. Again, I'd say the international markets continue to perform quite well, both Mexico, in Australia, Europe, U.K., all of them performed very well. But even within our U.S. business, we saw our enterprise segment do quite well. Even some of the over-the-road trucking was able to do some level of positive growth relative to the overall blended growth rate. So while the international markets carried most of the weight of the positive growth, we did see some pockets within the U.S. business that was also accretive to the overall. As we said, some of the small fleet business is just struggling a little bit in terms of filling the bucket back up with the sales activity as we've pivoted upmarket. 
Christopher Svensson: Got it. I appreciate that. And so I know there's been a few questions on the shift into consumer vehicle payments, but I find that pretty intriguing. So I'll ask another one here. Obviously, you've seen great success kind of building out the strategy in Brazil. But it seems to me like there's a lot of idiosyncrasies about that market that may get fairly unique compared to the U.K. or the U.S. that you called out earlier. So maybe can you talk about some of the hurdles that you might see on your path to implementing the consumer vehicle ecosystem in the U.S. and the U.K.? And how you're planning to get over those hurdles as you roll it out and what learnings you can take from the Brazil experience? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. It's another good question. I think the whole thing turns on the existing active customer file. So the big learning, I think, in Brazil, just to walk back in time, is if you recall there, the original consumer business was mostly tags initially. So hey, you go to the toll booth, you go to a store, you go online and, hey, I want a automatic toll tag, and I get one, and I stick it on my windshield and there it is. And so the big idea a couple of years ago there was to get people onto the phone, to get those same people that had a tag to be on the phone.
 And so what we learned there is once they are on the phone and checking things like their account or, hey, we put the content on like what the value of their car is because we know the car and stuff, that we found that there were 3 million of the 5 million people every month on the app on the phone doing stuff. And so that's what enabled the sales of additional things, for example, insurance, providing insurance. And so that's the hurdle. That's the million dollar question is, can you take a couple million active users that are on a phone every month in the U.K. and point them at 3 or 4 other things related to their vehicle like EV, for example, like servicing their car? Will that take like it has in Brazil? Because we have the rest of it. We have the networks.
 We obviously have tech that connects to these networks and have the host computers and the like and all kinds of G&A that's still on the top of all the stuff. So that's the focus. The game is that conversation, that marketing, that app with the consumer and their willingness to basically take things. And the secret idea I keep telling you is there's no more dated input. So rather than having 3 or 4 separate apps where I type in, I'm Ron Clarke, I have a Range Rover, here's the license plate, here's my credit card, here's my phone number and so on, it's kind of one and done. The vehicle and you and your card stuff is already in place to make the parking app go. And so it's kind of in place for the add-on apps. So I would point you to therein lies the big question to how fast we can grow this thing. 
Thomas Panther: And in Brazil, that's over 60% of the customer base is using multiple products. So it's a number where we feel like we can get some really good penetration over time as a significant number of people would do just as Ron described, that use case of I wanted to use one app to service the multiple types of activities and, ultimately, payment transactions surrounding their vehicle. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Let me just give you one thing, which I found fascinating. You like this or not. But to me, it's a bit of peanut butter and jelly. Hey, you've got a phone in your hand, and you're doing parking, getting to the park here. I'm going to be here for an hour or whatever. And then you carry it away and you go on the app and you extend your time another hour. So I know exactly when you parked, when you're leaving and stuff.
 Hey, what about contents insurance for that 2 hours? How about while you're parked at the stadium watching a game or something with no deductible, we covered during that 2-hour period theft from your vehicle? So I give that one as an example of we can nest, we think, some things like super duper close. We have your registration and stuff. We could provide notifications and reminders of when that thing is up. We'll scan for fines that you have. So the power of it is really in it being super close to what the existing application is. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Trevor Williams from Jefferies. 
Trevor Williams: I wanted to go back to the thinking on organic growth in 2024, and I know it's early days, so it's a rough sketch. But the 9% to 11%, that's in line with kind of what historically you've shared for organic targets. But Ron, how are you thinking about what the right growth rate is for fleet specifically now, especially with Russia out? So at least in the near term, how you're thinking about fleet within 9% to 11%? I think historically, it had been assumed to grow 7% to 9%, if you think you can get there in 2024 ex Russia. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Trevor, good question. I'd say probably too early a set of days to give you a super good answer. I'd say that we've done more work as we started sooner around the Corporate Payments. And because that stuff sells and then installed later, there's way visibility into the forward year, right? I kind of know what the backlog is as we head home for Christmas. So I think the big question of where we come out is, how much juice from the new, new stuff? So obviously, the baseline global Fleet business has been kind of low single digits the last few quarters. We obviously have 2 kind of big upsides around this new product line and new channel.
 And then obviously, this consumer piece, for example, like selling businesses parking. So I'd say it turns on that. To me, the question is how far out and how much are we going to invest basically in trying to boost some of these incremental things to try to move that number up faster. And remember, with the vehicle combo with Brazil, you're probably already at -- between the international, Brazil and the U.S., you're probably at 7% to 8%, so call it high single digits before you take a breath. And so the real push is going to be how much new, new do we layer on top of that.
 But as you can tell from my conversation, that that's what we're on and that's what we're going to really try to push. It's the #1, 2 and 3 assignments of this company is to take that big business and reuse it and get it back to being fine and exciting and going somewhere, so that we have 3 businesses that people like instead of 2. So I want you to hear loud and clear that that's what we're on. 
Trevor Williams: Understood. And then, Tom, just a quick one for you. The Corporate Payment margins, it looks like we're up a little more than 400 basis points year-over-year. I think you alluded to potentially some synergies coming through in your prepared remarks. Anything specific to call out there? I don't know if there was some Global Reach expense synergies that came through. But that would be helpful. 
Thomas Panther: Trevor, that's certainly a contributing factor in terms of the synergies that we're able to realize with Global Reach. We did a lot of heavy lifting over the spring and early summer to move on to one platform. We're able to eliminate some of the back office costs, technology costs. That was a significant contributor. And then just the positive operating leverage within the business and just look at the structural dynamics of that business and how the 20% revenue growth against a relatively stable fixed cost base are just going to generate positive operating leverage and drive margins higher. So combination of synergies and structural components would be the things that contributed to that. 
Operator: And your last question comes from the line of Kenneth Suchoski from Autonomous Research. 
Kenneth Suchoski: Ron, maybe one for you. I wanted to ask about the spin-merge opportunity with a strategic partner. You've been CEO at FLEETCOR for 2-plus decades and built the business out over time. So how do you think about your day-to-day responsibilities in a scenario where there is a spin/merger? And I guess, where would your responsibilities fall under that new structure, which would be two separate entities? And then separately, are there specific assets within B2B that you would look to combine with, either by product, segment of the market or geography? Or is the play really to find overlap with another business and take out the cost? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. So that's such a mouthful, Ken. So I'd say, first off, we're not sure, right? We've been working at this, and we have a couple of attractive combinations. But I don't want to leave this call where people think, hey, it's a day to complain, and Ron is resting or something. So that would be point one. I'd say they're possible, but I don't want to handicap it beyond that. That's number one. Number two is it depends on the structures again. So one of the structures that's kind of interesting is this idea of us spinning assets into a private entity and someone else. And in that case, it would almost look to me like a FLEETCOR company where we have a minority investor, which we had that world before, so I'm busy thinking about that thing as I am today.
 If it went the other way and we were to basically RMT it into something else that was public, I'd probably sit on the board and have a plan in advance of doing that, that we were clear on kind of where the thing was going. So to your point, to take something that's super valuable, we and I have to be super convinced that it's going to go on a path that makes sense, and it's going to get results that will warrant a premium. So we are spending a lot of time on those social issues and talk about how that would go.
 But my comment to you is I think I and others would be super involved certainly early on in whatever combination we went forward with. We're not going to just spin it and close our eyes. 
Kenneth Suchoski: Yes. That makes a lot of sense, Ron. And then I guess, just as my follow-up, some of the -- some of your payment peers have called out headwinds in their cross-border businesses. Specifically, they're seeing more cross-border transactions being done in U.S. dollars rather than those payments being converted to local currencies. I guess, are you guys seeing any of those trends? And I guess, how much of a risk is that for the cross-border payments business within Corporate Payments? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. That's a good follow-up. I'd say not much. I mean there's a little bit of it when FX volatility kind of right softens and kind of where the dollar was, whatever, a few weeks ago. But I'd say it's really on the margin. If you look at again what we're printing there, it's just -- it's the sheer volume growth, which is adding just more clients and more spend. And I'd say we're generally pretty stable, with maybe a smidge softness to your point, here and there. And then remember, for us, the diversity in that business, right?
 So we originate, I guess, about 80% of all the business, all the revenue outside of the United States, right, so in Canada, the U.K., Europe, Australia. And so the geographic diversity in kind of the originating currencies also have a big impact. So the -- it's a little bit of a hedge, right? One place is a little bit weaker, but then the counter-party is a little bit stronger. So I don't say we're immune, but I'd say we're not seeing much in the way of slowdown. 
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you all for participating. You may all disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-08-08 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. This call is being recorded on Tuesday, August 8, 2023. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jim Eglseder, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
James Eglseder: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our second quarter 2023 earnings call. With me today are Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO; and Tom Panther, our CFO. Following their prepared remarks, the operator will announce that the queue will open for the Q&A session. It is only then that you can get in line for questions. Please note, our earnings release and the supplement can be found under the Investor Relations section on our website at fleetcor.com.  
 Now throughout this call, we will be covering organic revenue growth. As a reminder, this metric neutralizes the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and fuel spreads. It also includes pro forma results for acquisitions closed during the 2 years being compared. We will also be covering non-GAAP financial metrics, including revenues, net income and net income per diluted share, all on an adjusted basis. These measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than in other companies. Reconciliations of the historical non-GAAP to the most directly comparable GAAP information can be found in today's press release and on our website. 
 I also need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today may include forward-looking statements. These statements reflect the best information we have as of today. All statements about our outlook, new products and expectations regarding business development and future acquisitions are based on that information. They are not guarantees of future performance, and you should not put undue reliance upon them. We undertake no obligation to update any of these statements. The expected results are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect today. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K and on our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available both on our website and at sec.gov. Now with that out of the way, I will turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay. Jim, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Up front here, I'll plan to cover 4 subjects: first, provide my take on our Q2 results. Second, I'll share our updated 2023 guidance. Third, update you on a few key priorities that we're working and then lastly, discuss the status of our strategic review.  
 Okay. Let me begin with our Q2 results which finished better than our expectations. We reported revenue of $948 million and cash EPS of $419 million, both of those up sequentially. Our Q2 EBITDA almost touched $500 million, which is an all-time record for us. Both our print revenue  growth and organic revenue growth came in at 10% for the quarter. The reason is Q2 print revenue helped by acquisition revenue and hurt by lower fuel prices, so effectively a wash. The components of our overall 10% organic revenue growth were fleet stepping up 6% for the quarter, helped a lot there by our international markets, particularly Mexico and Australia, both of those up over 20% for the quarter. Also, our EV revenue increased 45% year-over-year.  
 Brazil grew 15% in Q2 and continued strength in our core toll line, tag volume, they're up 7%, helped by our new bank partnerships also increasing demand for our new vehicle insurance add-ons. Lodging, up 14%, led by our airline vertical, that results from a number of new airline implementations, along with the growing usage of our auto rebooking feature for distressed  passengers. And finally, corporate payments up 22%. That was led by our direct payables business. That was up over 30% in the quarter. Also our cross-border business doing great, enjoyed record levels of new sales and new accounts. 
 Turning to the trends or fundamentals in the quarter, also quite good. sales grew 20% in Q2. Inside of that number, corporate payment sales up 80% versus last year which reflects strong demand for that product line. Our North America fuel sales remained pretty soft in the quarter. That reflects the pivot we made away from micro SMB accounts last fall in an effort to control bad debt. Retention good remained steady at 91%, and that's despite a set of aggressive credit policies that we changed. And same-store sales finishing flat, really a mix of pockets of both strength and weakness. Weakness, we saw in our lodging managed accounts business and strength really in the stability, improving stability in our North America trucking business.  
 So look, all in all, a bit better Q2 than we had expected, a really terrific start to the first half. Year-to-date revenues, sales and earnings all coming in ahead of plan.  
 Okay. Let me shift gears and share our outlook for rest of the year 2023. 
 First off, we're calling for the second half macro to be roughly neutral to our recent [ 3 + 9 ] view, albeit with some puts and takes, specifically expecting better FX, but lower fuel prices. We're revising full year 2023 guidance, including Russia, of revenue of $3.848 billion at the midpoint and cash EPS of 17, 22 at the midpoint. This updated guide reflects the flow-through of our $8 million Q2 revenue beat and $0.07 cash EPS beat, so leaving the second half prior guide intact. And although the business is running ahead of our internal expectations for the first half, there is considerable sequential revenue growth still baked into our second half forecast. The revised second half guide implies  print revenue growth of about 12% and organic revenue growth of about 10%, pretty consistent with the first half.  
 Finally, the guide implies an attractive Q4 exit with revenue growth expected to be 14% and reach $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time. So pretty exciting. We do expect cash EPS growth of 16% in the exit as we begin to lap interest rates from last year.  
 Okay. Let me make the turn and share our progress against a few important priorities. So first, EV. We're continuing to progress our EV efforts along with our understanding of how the energy transition may in fact, affect our business. If you would look at Pages 12 through 14 in our earnings supplement. So on the economics front, EV vehicles, at least among our commercial mixed fleet clients continues to be very favorable. EV vehicles, they are generating more revenue per vehicle than a comparable ICE vehicle. We've seen this positive trend now over the last 10 quarters. So really super good news there.  
 Second, EV is beginning to grow. EV revenue in Q2, up 45% versus the prior year. And the number of U.K. EV commercial accounts nearly tripled in Q2 versus prior year. Okay. Second up is our fleet Board refreshment initiative. We added 3 new directors to the fleet Board here in calendar 2023 and have had 2 long tenured directors retire. This move has strengthened both our audit and tech committee oversight and greatly enhance our diversity.  
 So last up in terms of updates is our North America fleet sales pivot. You may recall, we were selling a lot of super small micro accounts digitally last year and made the decision to move digital sales upmarket to bigger company prospects. So some progress there. Again, we essentially stopped onboarding new super small 1 and 2 card sized companies about 9 months ago. And although this reduces our overall North America fleet sales, we do expect the second half fleet credit losses to decrease about 30% to 35% sequentially first half versus second half. Good news, we are increasing the number of new fuel apps that have more than 5 cards. That's from modifying our digital advertising bidding engine. So that's working. We do expect to be on the other side of this digital sales transition as we exit '23 and thus better positioned to accelerate fuel card sales next year.  
 Okay. Last up is the status of our strategic review in which we're reevaluating the portfolio of our company with the idea of potentially separating one or more of our businesses. As you can imagine, we've been quite busy with this review, along with our overall value creation plan.  
 So first, on overhangs on the FTC front, we have closed the FTC injunctive relief chapter. You may recall, we received the court order. We're implementing the remaining disclosure request there and expect to be in compliance by the end of this month. We do believe that our North America fuel business exceeds the very best industry marketing and disclosure practices. Russia, we have now received all necessary government approvals to close the Russia sale. We are working through some final closing mechanics and hopeful that, that deal will close later this month. Tom will speak to the expected financial impact of the Russia sale here in just a minute.  
 Second, noncore assets, we are progressing the potential sale of a couple of noncore assets. We're well underway in exploring the sale of our prepaid businesses. We're also in discussions regarding a few small divestitures that are within our vehicle line of business.  
 Third, fleet reinvention. We're pretty aggressively working to reposition our global fleet business, the goal is to create really an exciting future for fleet that promises sustainable and durable growth. We think we're out in front here in EV and actually expect EV to accelerate growth in that business. We're continuing to broaden our set of vehicle-related payment solutions, of solutions beyond fuel. And we do believe that re-rating our biggest business and biggest earnings contributors, is really the #1 driver of the company's overall value creation.  
 So lastly, the topic of separation. We are exploring with the help of Goldman Sachs, the idea of separating one or more of our businesses to further unlock value. Our path initially is to look simply at separating or spinning off one of our major businesses into a separate company. So the considerations or assumptions here are around forward pro forma multiples, what would the stand-alone company trade at, tax impacts dis-synergies of the separation, opportunities for future M&A, really a whole host of things.  
 The second path is to potentially combine one of our 3 major businesses with the [ dans ] partner. That would be a pure-play company that provides very similar solutions to one of our 3 big businesses. So we are actively involved in exploring a few [ dans ] partner combinations and evaluating the attractiveness of that path.  
 As promised on our last call, we expect to complete our work on each of these 4 initiatives before year-end and for sure, we'll share our conclusions with you then.  
 Okay. So look, in closing today, I do want to reiterate that we are pleased with Q2 and our first half performance, our financials and KPIs ahead of our initial expectations. We are flowing through our Q2 beat and raising full year 2023 guidance. We are progressing a few of our key priorities again, particularly on the EV front, and we are actively exploring several portfolio moves in an effort to re-rate our multiple.  
 So with that, let me turn the call back over to Tom to provide some additional detail on the quarter. Tom? 
Thomas Panther: Thanks, Ron. Here are some additional details related to the macro environment during the quarter. We had 10% organic revenue growth in Q2, and our reported revenue growth was also 10% and as the growth from recent acquisitions offset fuel price headwinds. Revenue of $948 million exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $8 million, comprised of $13 million in higher revenue partially offset by $5 million of fuel-related macro, which flowed through to our $0.07 beat in cash EPS of $4.19.  
 Fuel prices were $3.65 per gallon for the quarter, lower than our $3.99 guide from May, which caused approximately $20 million of lower revenues versus prior year. We exited the quarter with fuel prices around $3.55 per gallon, but prices rose in July to approximately $3.60 per gallon, a trend we expect to continue over the balance of the year based on the EIA forecast. Fuel spreads were positive versus prior year by about $5 million.  
 Lastly, we had $9 million of negative impact from lower foreign exchange rates, mainly due to the decline in the ruble as the economic impact from the war drags on. In aggregate, we had $23 million of macro headwind versus last year that we were able to power through by way of organic and acquisition-related growth.  
 Now on to our performance for the quarter. As I previously mentioned, organic revenue growth was 10%, reflecting the healthy diversification of our business and the realization of strong sales from last year that continued into the first half of this year. Corporate Payments revenue was up 22%, driven by strength in our direct business, including full AP software solutions, which again grew over 50%. Our comprehensive menu of high-quality payment solutions continues to sell incredibly well as we sign up new customers who are looking to transform their AP operations.  
 Cross-border revenue was up almost 30% as sales remained strong and client transaction activity was again robust. We completed the global reach, customer migration and are now focused on selling our combined set of products and services in all geographies, which is contributing to our strong performance. In addition, we remain committed to realizing the cost synergies and as we rationalize the IT and facilities overlap, which will help expand margins in the second half of the year.  
 Turning to our fleet business. Organic revenue increased 6% driven by higher revenue per transaction and sales growth, especially in our international markets. In the U.S., we are seeing early success from our pivot and digital sales to a slightly larger customer segment but we are still feeling the effects from significantly reducing our micro SMB fleet sales beginning in the third quarter of last year. We anticipate digital sales to improve heading into next year as we adjust our lead generation strategies and conversion pipelines.  
 To expand on Ron's comments regarding our market-leading EV solutions in Europe, we are seeing over 20% sequential quarter growth in accounts, cards and home charging users, and we continue to expand our proprietary charging network which translated into over 30% sequential growth in kilowatt hours charged. While the revenue base remains relatively small, given the emerging usage of commercial EVs, it's a great start and we are committed to building upon our unique capabilities.  
 Brazil's revenue grew 15% compared to last year, driven by 7% tag growth. We now have 6.5 million tag users, which enables us to further increase the proportion of revenue from our expanded network of products where we earn interchange. In the current quarter, approximately 36% of our B2C revenue was from the expanded network.  
 Sales also remained strong, increasing 16% driven by a robust digital, field and partner distribution channels. Lodging revenue increased 14% which was in line with our expectations. I would note that the business grew 41% last year. So this quarter is up against a tough year-over-year comp. This quarter's solid performance was highlighted by sales success across our industry verticals. In addition to revenue per room night that increased 19%, driven primarily from channel and product mix.  
 The Other segment declined 14% due to a shift in the timing of cards ordered by our retail clients in our gift business. In the second quarter of last year, card orders were pulled forward from Q3 and Q4 as retailers wanted to ensure supply chain delays did not impact their card stock for the year-end holiday season. Our full year net revenue expectations for this business remain in line with our prior expectations.  
 Now looking further down the income statement. Operating expenses of $536 million represented a 9% increase over Q2 of the prior year, primarily due to the addition of the Roomex Plugsurfing and Global Reach Group operations. The increase in OpEx was also impacted by higher bad debt, increases tied to higher transaction and sales activities and investments to drive future growth. Bad debt expense was $35 million or 7 basis points of spend, which was stable with last year and in line with our expectations. We currently expect bad debt to improve approximately 20% in the back half of the year compared to the second half of 2022.  
 EBITDA margin in the quarter was 52.4% which is 140 basis points improvement from 51% in the first quarter of this year and 30 basis points higher than last year. Normalizing for our recent capability acquisitions, EBITDA margin increased 130 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. We still expect our full year EBITDA margin to improve throughout the year and exit around 200 to 250 basis points better than the prior year. This will be driven by solid revenue growth and synergies realized from acquisitions.  
 Interest expense increased $65 million year-over-year driven by the increase in SOFR on our debt stack. The impact of higher interest rates resulted in an approximate $0.57 drag on Q2 adjusted EPS. Over the past few months, we've been monitoring swap rates relative to the SOFR forward curve. In August, we executed $2 billion of fixed rate swaps with an average maturity of 3.5 years, an average fixed rate of 4.3%. These swaps provide immediate positive carry of approximately 100 basis points and ladders out the fixed rate portion of our debt stack, which is now approximately 60% fixed. These interest rate risk management actions capitalized on the strong relative value of swap rates at the 3- to 4-year point of the curve, generating an immediate benefit to interest expense and substantially reduces interest expense volatility going forward without incurring outsized duration risk.  
 Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.6% versus 23.7% last year, which reflected a discrete tax item that positively affected the 2022 tax rate.  
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.25 billion in unrestricted cash, and we had $768 million available on our revolver. We have $5.5 million outstanding on our credit facilities and we had $1.25 billion borrowed under our securitization facility. As of June 30, our leverage ratio was 2.6x trailing 12 months EBITDA as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement. We made no open market share repurchases in the quarter, and we still have over $1.2 billion authorized for share repurchases. We have ample liquidity to pursue near-term M&A opportunities and continue to buy back shares when it makes sense. 
 In addition to Ron's overview of our full year guidance, let me give you some additional detail, including some thoughts on our Q3 outlook and supporting assumptions, which can be found in our supplemental materials. For the full year, we now expect GAAP revenues between $3.836 billion and $3.86 billion. Adjusted net income between $1.281 billion and $1.303 billion. Adjusted net income per diluted share between $17.09 and $17.35. And finally, EBITDA growth of 17%.  
 For Q3, we're expecting revenue to be between $980 million and $1 billion, and adjusted net income per share to be between $4.44 and $4.64 per share, which, at the midpoint, is up 7% of what we reported in Q3 of 2022. All of these estimates include Russia for the full year.  
 We are now assuming an August close of our Russian business as we continue to work through the final closing details. Upon close, we expect revenues for the year to be $45 million to $55 million lower, resulting in a $0.25 to $0.35 decline in adjusted EPS over the remainder of the year. Based on using the sale proceeds for buybacks. This guidance is consistent with our previous guidance after adjusting for anticipated August close.  
 Related to our guidance assumptions. we are using $3.66 for our fuel price assumption for the rest of the year. Our interest expense guidance of $330 million to $340 million is based off an average SOFR rate of 5.31% for the rest of the year. Additional assumptions can be found in our press release and supplement. With that, thank you for your interest in FLEETCOR. And now operator, we'd like to open the line for questions. Thank you 
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Tiem-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Good afternoon, everybody. I appreciate the update on thing. So I guess, Ron, I want to ask you, with you're moving forward with the strategic review, you mentioned a couple of options on the separation and some views on the noncore. And I know you've probably learned a ton here. I don't think you're going to tell us which way you're leaning per se. But as you've learned through this process, I mean, have you changed your priorities on how you're going to seek value? And I know this has taken up a lot of your time, but is the preference to seek immediate value for certain? Or are there some other things that you see that could be value creative that maybe could last over the mid- to longer term, if you follow my question. Really immediate gratification versus sort of a long-term balancing ex. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Tien-Tsin, I have no idea where to go with that question. Yes. We're obviously, as I tried to say in the opening, working the thing pretty hard right? Running through these 3 or 4 different areas. I guess I would say in terms of leading your comment of, hey, what do we think? What do I think? Has the chance to re-rate to get the value. I'd say 2 things. One, we think getting people to believe the fleet business or what we're going to transform into the vehicle business that, that's got a durable, and exciting future as kind of Job 1, 2 and 3 because it's so big. It's such a big part of the company, and particularly the EV part of that story. So I'd say we are working that like super hard and it will come full with some stuff in [ 90 days ].  
 The second one on the separation thing, I'd say that, to me, the separation is much more interesting and compelling if we can do it in combination with something, not only because that could create more scale and stuff in the space but also potentially have a bunch of synergies with it. And so the structural separation enables in some ways transactions that are not as easy out of the mothership.  So I'd say that those would be my 2. It's the fleet reinvention where people believe in the future and the potential for separation that would also include a combination. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: So, I wrote down, Ron. I didn't ask the question very well. I think you mentioned that EV would accelerate growth in the fleet business. I think EV grew 47%. Do you feel like you have a good line of sight now, at least in the short to midterm, on the EV piece and how it would supplement growth within fleet. Can you tell us a little bit more on where the sources of revenues are coming from? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, that's another too good question. I mean the first thing, Tien-tsin, is just if you take the existing accounts, the defensive nature. So, hey, this vehicle, we have millions of vehicles. What if some of those vehicles are EVs? So the first conclusion or forming conclusion is we don't care. We could be in different matter of what commercial vehicles exist in a bunch of years from now as long as they're owned by the company, we can make money, we can make revenue. And in fact, we're making more.  
 The second one is, it's looking like because our EV stuff is a bit better. We're out ahead of other people, including, for example, the oil companies. that we might do better in our basic selling and retaining commercial fleets that we have because we get advantage by having the combined old fashion and new fashion package. And then the third one, we've got a new trick comment on the consumer side, which is a segment that we're not in. So to the extent that we can light up the consumer side by just repurposing the stuff we have. So that's kind of the 1, 2, 3. Neutral to flat kind of in the first one, went a bit more in the commercial and then add the consumer, that would be the trifecta. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. 
Ramsey El-Assal: I wanted to ask about the fleet segment organic revenues. It came in above our model. I think you called out some outperformance in international markets, Mexico, Australia. Just curious what was the driver there that sort of upside surprise? And should we expect whatever boosted growth internationally to kind of continue through the remainder of the year? 
Thomas Panther: Ramsey, it's Tom. I appreciate the question. Ram, it's just a variety of things. I think we saw some good transaction activity in our international markets. And keep in mind, our international markets diversified beyond just fuel. We have other businesses within that fleet segment that also helps drive growth. So it's just a function of where the business was performing. I'll also say that fuel price in our international markets were stickier, particularly at the retail side than what we necessarily would experience here in the U.S. So that also helps kind of bolster the international side and the overall revenue growth. Obviously, we'll relook at that growth rate going forward when we're successful in closing the Russia transaction. That will affect it to some degree. But overall, we saw a nice healthy pickup in the overall growth rate. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Hey, Ramsey, it's Ron. Just to add, I think we said on the last call that the thing would kind of tick along, right? That it was lower. And so kind of mid-single digits is still kind of where our guide is. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. All right. And I think the answer to this question is probably no, based on your performance in the quarter and your guide, but I wanted to ask regardless, any impact from the yellow bankruptcy. I know they're not a big customer, any residual credit exposure or anything like that? 
Ronald F. Clarke: No, no exposure to yellow. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Nick Cremo with CrÃ©dit Suisse. 
Nikolai Cremo: I just wanted to follow up on Ramsey's question on the Fleet segment. Could you just tell us what growth was in the North American Fleet segment, maybe just like on a same-store sales basis? And then as my follow-up question, could we expect this mid-single-digit revenue per transaction growth to continue in the second half? 
Thomas Panther: Nick, it's Tom. We actually don't break it down beyond the segment level. So I mean, I think overall, we kind of keep it at the total fleet level and the international business outperformed U.S. But getting into kind of the details is just something that we stay away from. And then going forward, I think as we just said, I think you can continue to expect borrowing, we see fuel prices and spreads hang to somewhere in the range of our guidance. That you would see that mid-single-digit type growth rate as we look ahead into Q3 and Q4. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Hey, Nick, it's Ron. Let me just add on to what Tom said, pretty consistent same-store sales in the fleet business. Let's look about the same in the last few quarters, so not a lot going on there. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. 
Darrin Peller: Maybe just one on the core pay segment for a minute, just given how strong it continues to be. And if we break down the segment by obviously, the different sources of growth, I'd love to hear more about what you're seeing the most strength out of and sustainability of those. I mean, you made some comments, obviously, on invoice pay. But anything more would be great. And then, Ron, I know we've touched on cross-selling that business into the fleet side as well. So curious on your thoughts there if there's been any progress. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Darren, good question. Yes. So first off, we're happy someone picked on us or me. I think last time saying, hey, he said around 20%, I think it was 19%. So I don't that guys on [indiscernible] 22%. So on the strength side, the direct business is what I'd say we've called out before, that we're not happy with the channel of the partner business where the thing started 7 years ago. That thing is still negative and trending down. So to end up with 22%  consolidated to tell you that the direct stuff is well north of 22%, which obviously we're super excited about. There's no concentration in that business. So that's doing well. And I do need to call out for the cross-border thing. I mean, I don't know if you heard it, but the sales, so new business was up 80%, 8-0 percent quarter-over-quarter. So it's an all-time record of the amount of new business that we've sold and cross-border was just crazy in terms of sales. So I don't know if people are hearing this, but sales in that business and the performance in the direct business are trending way above what we thought they would be.  
 So your last question on cross-sell. So we did an interesting thing, saying as part of the strategic review, where we looked at our 3 biggest businesses in the U.S., right, fleet lodging and corporate payments. And we said, let's go into what we call the blue box. So companies that are not like micro, call it, above 10 million. And we focus on 3 industries where about 70% of the clients are. And we find that we've got about 15% to 20% overlap already. So in other words, when we take the clients that, let's say, fleet has, that lodging has, and the corporate payments has that are kind of not small, and we say, "Hey, do they have more than one?" The answer is lots of the clients have more than 1, that's 15% to 20% overlap. And the reason that we haven't called it out before is because we started in those product silos and unrelated brand, the  businesses just went to Ron Clarke and sold each of the 3 products. So now clearly, we started advertising in the Corpay brand to those bit bigger accounts and tell them, "Hey, we got all 3 things." So everyone should expect that there'll be more of that, more of the same kind of decent sized prospective customer taking everything we've got. 
Darrin Peller: Good, good. That's good to hear. And just my quick follow-up would be around capital allocation. It just seems like there was a little bit less in the way of buybacks in the first half. So is there any change to your strategy on cap allocation? Or is it waiting for the Russia deal to close or anything else going on that we should just be aware of? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, it's a good follow-up. So no change. Obviously, M&A continues to be the lead dog. And given the strategic review and some of the M&A activity that's inherent, right, in the combination the comments that I've made. So that's part of it. And then the second one, you got it, we basically will earmark proceeds if we're successful in closing out the Russia sale and/or the prepaid sales, you should expect we'll be buying stock back. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Peter Christiansen with Citigroup. 
Peter Christiansen: Thanks for the question. Nice trends here. I wanted to first talk about the margin expansion that you're looking for this year, which is pretty commendable considering the full fuel price decline, which is we all know can be quite detrimental. I was just wondering where you're seeing the sources of margin uptake, I guess, for the full year, I guess, in the second half of the year? Is it a mix shift? Is it a particular segment that you're seeing better, cost execution, operating leverage? Any color there would be helpful. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Pete, it's Ronald. Let me start, and then I'll let Tom jump in. So the first one is there's always operating leverage inherent in the business, right? So as our revenue climbs, right? So our second half revenue will be up, I don't know, a top $100 million or $150 million, Pete, is our guide over the first half. So the marginal EBITDA flow through on that incremental revenue is super duper high. 
 And then the second one I'd say is kind of lapping the capability acquisitions. I think we said earlier that that's tapping, call it, 100 to 200 basis points out of our EBITDA margin, right? Investing in things for the future. So as we lap that, we'll pick it up. In fact, the piece of paper in front of me is our internal Q4 forecast, which has our consolidated margin up about 340 basis points. So if the revenue comes in, and we get the operating leverage and we lap the thing, our margins will be way strong. We're exiting Q4 than they were last year. 
James Faucette: Add keeping on the acquisition front, we also expect to continue to realize some synergies from our GRT acquisition. So that will help some. And then also stock comp, bad debt will also improved relative to year-over-year related to those 2 items as well. So those items and the items that Ron commented on argument that acceleration in margin. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, that bad debt was just an important one, right? That they grew surprise , i think lots of people, right? In the second half, which is why we reacted relatively quickly and we're seeing the trends both in what we reported here and what we're forecasting. So to Tom's point, there's a pretty big step down as you exit Q4, which obviously is super helpful to the EBITDA margin. 
Peter Christiansen: No. That's a good point. You guys just have a good history of getting after bad debt in the past for sure. My follow-up question, and Ron hit on it earlier. You called out some really impressive growth in Corpay, particularly the cross-border and certainly full AP. Just wondering if you could paint the picture at least qualitatively what's going on in the virtual card side and the direct side, a little bit more, just give us a sense of the direction of those slices of business would be helpful. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Pete, it's Ron again. I think as I mentioned, the sales is the lead indicator, right? So the fact that not only in the quarter, but I'm looking at the year-to-date, it's a record level of sales, both in the payables side of the business and in the cross-border. So that's the first point. And then in terms of what we're selling, the mix has shifted more to full AP, but we still do sell stand-alone virtual card. And I think if you had our sales group in the room, the idea of having both areas to draw on, hey, look, I'll pay some of your bills, pal, or I'll pay all of your bills. You tell me what you want, and I can give you some money back either way. So that 2 for pitch, I think, is resonating. So we're still selling both the stand-alone and the full, but a bit more of the full these days. 
James Faucette: And Peter, we're also seeing good acceleration on just sheer volume increase. And some of that is from sales and some of that is just from deepening with our existing customer base, getting implementations onboarded and also working real hard to try to get as much cardable spend as possible. So all of those things in terms of the front door and mining the existing portfolio, all drive that to impress the growth level. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey from Truist Securities. 
Andrew Jeffrey: Appreciate you taking the question. Great results in Corpay, which is good to see. Maybe for you, Tom, can you elaborate a little bit on what mix might mean to yield in that segment? Are you sort of -- and maybe gross profit to relatively indifferent to full stack payables versus FX? And if FX continues to be as strong as it is, anything we need to think about as far as mix or contribution margin or gross profit margin within that segment? 
Thomas Panther: No, they don't -- Andrew, they don't differ materially between the subsegments within that overall business. Both of them are attractive. They're also -- they're obviously different businesses. Our payables business is much more domestically oriented where our cross-border is much more internationally oriented. We like the diversification that, that brings. But there isn't necessarily a material margin difference that you need to be modeling in. I think both of them, as Ron mentioned, just in terms of what we see from a sales perspective, have very strong sales results, solid pipeline. And both of them have recurring business with existing customers. You may kind of think of cross-borders more transaction-oriented one-and-done kinds of relationships or anything but that. They're generally customers who have recurring tight cross-border transactions. And so that provides us kind of a healthy recurring type revenue stream coming from those businesses. So they're more probably, other than the products and their geographies, their economics and their kind of compositions are more similar than you may normally think. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Hey, Andrew, it's Ron. Just one other difference to point out on top of Thomas made. The cross-border business not only do we make a lot of sales and their sales are way up, but their cost of sales are super attractive. They're the second most efficient sale in our company in terms of what it costs us to get $1 of sales, so we love that. And then second, they start super fast. So the start rate, what you would call implementation is super duper quick from kind of when we roll call or say it's contracted. So those are 2 things actually about that particular line of business that make it really attractive. 
Andrew Jeffrey: Okay. That's helpful. And then I wanted to touch a little bit, if I could, on the digital marketing initiatives. It sounds like they're starting to gain some attraction up market. Any sort of LTV to CAC considerations as you sign those bigger accounts that we need to be thinking about? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I'd say not really, Andrew. I'd say it's pretty complicated to move a big machine like that. It gets tuned right a certain way, like a piano  or something gets tuned to work a certain way, and then we kind of haul the thing and say, okay, repoint the machinery in a different way. So it needs to grab lots of data to start it to kind of sort itself out again. So it's taken probably a bit longer. But as I said in my opening, it's working, the number of bigger new accounts coming to us digitally is growing now. So I don't want to say it was easy, but it's way easier to stop the problem. They just don't tune up the small ones. It's way harder to get more of the big one. So we've always -- I think 50% of our business has always been bigger accounts. So we're totally used to that, both underwriting them and servicing them and starting on that. So really, it's just getting smarter about how to spend money to get the appropriate segment in the door. 
Andrew Jeffrey: Okay. So it sounds like only upside from here. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. It didn't matter. I mean that's what I want to call out is -- literally i brought the thing to a screeching halt because we were not going to pose some crazy credit number. And the good news is that work, the credit numbers are already down and we're forecasting a roll rates were to be down. So Job 1 is past tense, it's accomplished. Job 2, I'm saying started in Q2 to get better, the number of new bigger stuff has increased. And now I told the guy, it's getting up and go, get your horse going, we need to weigh more of it. So we'll report whether we're picking that pace up as we run through the second half. 
James Eglseder: And field sales remain strong. And those are obviously already at a larger client segment level, and they continue to be a significant portion of the overall and they've been doing quite well as well. So that kind of buffers a little bit of the impact from our pivot in digital. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Nate Svensson with Deutsche Bank. 
Christopher Svensson: I wanted to ask about monthly trends in the organic fleet business as we move through the second quarter? And then any update on what you've seen in July and August month-to-date. And the reason I ask is it that previously you had pointed for sort of a continued acceleration off of that 3% organic growth that you saw in the first quarter through the remainder of the year. So kind of just wondering how that trended through the quarter. And I know you got it to mid-single digits for the full year, but just wondering about the potential for a continued sequential acceleration as we move into 3Q. 
James Eglseder: Yes, I'll take it, Nate. I mean really from a monthly perspective, there weren't really anomalies. Obviously, there's certain day counts and how many weeks within a particular month that can kind of skew the numbers from month to month. So it can be a little bit misleading to kind of just look at pure months. But just from a business momentum perspective, I would say, we saw significant shifts in terms of volumes and transactions and things like that. As we head into July, I'd say, probably more of the same. Maybe with the benefit of what we've seen more recently, uptick in crude, that will translate into higher retail. And so that should provide a number that's right within the guidance number that we referenced right in that [ 365 366 ] range. So nothing really out of the ordinary to call out. I think we'll continue to expect some level of seasonal growth as the summer continues. We think it into some of the heavy agricultural months. Those months can also drive a fair amount of usage. So all of those things, I think, point us to kind of the direction we've commented on here earlier on the call. 
Christopher Svensson: Got it. I appreciate all that color. And I guess for my follow-up, I'll ask on lodging. I don't think that's come up here in the Q&A. So revenue growth, 14% off a very difficult comp was impressive. But noticed that revenue nights were down sequentially and year-over-year. And I also believe in the prepared remarks, you mentioned some softness in managed accounts. So maybe you can give some color on that softness that you're seeing? And then relatedly, I know you maintained sort of mid-teens growth for the full year, but any color on the cadence of growth as we move into the back half and comps get a lot easier moving past the second quarter? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Nate. It's Ron again. So yes, you're right. I did call it out. I'd say, we're a little surprised. I'm not really super sure why, but when we go through our managed accounts, which in English means something like groups of people, consulting groups or an environmental group, the utility going somewhere, so larger groups like going to a place like to do something, merchandising groups that would go to Walmart.  I think that's kind of what that business is. And so for some reason, some number of accounts just on their own did less of it in Q2 than what we were out looking. And so when we call, it's not super clear, we say, "Hey, is that going to be at that level?" or "kind of where you were before." So that was kind of a bit, call it, a couple of points of growth of the soft pocket that we didn't outlook. So I'd say we're not super certain what that's going to look like going forward. It's not like a lot of them quit us, as you can see in the retention rate. So look, we're hopeful that whatever that is, was kind of transitory for the quarter. 
Unknown Executive: There on that, Nate, is that we have a nice diversification of airline and insurance that kind of helps offset that as well where we've seen some pretty good strength as we commented earlier. 
Ronald F. Clarke: And we have a big, what we call custom business and [ Joint ] accounts like railroads and trucking firms, we have a small SMB business, we call it direct. So there's a lot of other segments in the business. But there was this one -- this kind of consulting [ traveler ] group so I did want to call out. Look, still happy with mid-teens. We plan that business at mid-teens. So it's performed above that level. So I want people to be clear, still happy with it. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Trevor Williams with Jefferies. 
Trevor Williams: So on Russia, I appreciate the updated sale impact on the reported numbers, but I was hoping we could get some help on what the organic growth in fleet in the quarter would have looked like ex Russia. And same thing for the mid-single-digit target for the full year for fleet, just what that growth rate would look like without Russia? 
Unknown Executive: Yes. Trevor, we'll update all of that when the transaction closes and we kind of refresh all of that. Let's come back to you on that. I think until we kind of get the transaction closed, we'll wait and reset after that, if that's okay. 
Trevor Williams: Okay. Fair enough. And then on the guide, Ron, you alluded to, there is still a decent amount of sequential growth implied both for the third and fourth quarter. Maybe just talk us through, especially for Q4, kind of the level of visibility you think you have in, I think it's $20 million that's implied quarter-over-quarter in Q4. It sounds like maybe you're getting some of the new sales into the larger fleet customers that might start layering on, but anything else just on kind of level of visibility into that? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, good question. The first thing I'd say is we had a decent look at July. So that's always helpful. So that's tracking to our guide. So when Tom and I built the second half, the output we have is that, that's on track. Yes, the thing does, bill sequentially, which is Ron's favorite thing about the business. I think I told people this is a snowball. He started downhill and there's more snows as you roll down the hill. So that's the nature of a recurring revenue business as we beat sales, so we're ahead of sales year-to-date. And I call it like corporate payments, which is way ahead as that stuff gets implemented to Tom's point, that attaches more snow, the ball rolls and obviously, sequentially, I think we're up about $40 million sequentially already Q2 versus Q1. So I'd say, look, our confidence is pretty high. We're on track. We have the sales in the bag. We just need to get them implemented and then there's the seasonality, right? Q3 is always a super duper quarter and Q4 is better than Q1. So we get some benefit of strength. For example, Brazil is always super duper good, for example, in Q4. So we've been having a long time, I think, unless something kind of go sideways on the planet that we're pretty comfortable with the guide. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. 
Mihir Bhatia: I wanted to ask a little bit more about take rates or just the revenue per transaction or per spend in corporate payments. You saw some pretty good growth there. I think in lodging, you called out, it was product and channel driven. But maybe talk a little bit more about the fleet segment in particular. What drove the strength in revenue per transaction there and also in corporate payments, if you wouldn't mind. 
Unknown Executive: Yes, I'll take a swing at that, and I may have missed a little bit of the question. It's take rate in both corporate payments and fleet, Mihir ? 
Mihir Bhatia: Yes. Correct. 
Thomas Panther: Generally, just kind of mix. There's really nothing in particular to call out. You see a little bit of an increase in the take rate when you refer to our release. Again, it's a pretty modest increase. So I think it's just a matter of just mix of business and really nothing more to really call out besides that. We're always competitive with respect to our pricing and things like that. So I think, fuel will also factor into what our overall spread and how those things have played out. And so it's just a combination of things, but nothing really out of the ordinary. And that's kind of what you're seeing in the numbers in terms of just kind of a slight increase in rate. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Mihir, it's Ron. Just to add to that, which is in corporate payments, the mix shift that Tom refers to, we think, will go on. So when we tell you guys today that we're growing mid- to high-20s in the direct corporate payments business and that the channel business is going backwards, the delta in those take rates is significant. Call it, 4 or 5x different. So every turn of that, every forward quarter with the direct business is growing, let's say, 25% or higher and the channel business is shrinking, that will improve that rate prospectively. 
Mihir Bhatia: All right. No, that is helpful. And then if I can ask one big -- one more -- just a big picture type question. I think earlier you were talking about doing a little bit more digital marketing, more cross-sell. At the same time, you are in the midst of a strategic review about potentially divesting some businesses. I just wanted to ask about the puts and takes with that. How aggressive are you going to be on cross-sell in the short term 'til we know where the strategic review is ending up? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Another really good question. So I'd say that we're trying to learn. And I think the first finding today is that we have cross selling. And when we study among the larger clients that we have, they use more than one of our products. I'm reporting today, yes, they do. So the second thing we're doing is advertising now that we've consolidated the brand, we're generating way more leads by offering up more solutions to the same prospective company. So I think that's just another input for us potentially in the synergies or dissynergies as we think about the separation. And obviously, to the extent that the separation still made lots of sense. There's no reason we couldn't have some kind of agreement -- commercial agreement with the company afterwards as an example. So I think we're just running them on separate tracks and learning what we can and see where it lands us. But it's clearly an input into the separation decision for sure. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Ken Suchoski from Autonomous Research. 
Kenneth Suchoski: I just wanted to ask about corporate payments. I think you mentioned, Ron, that the cross-border new business is up 80% quarter-over-quarter. Those new sales ramp pretty quickly. So I guess, is the expectation that this business grows above 20% or maybe even north of 22% for the rest of the year and into 2024? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. So look, I want to make sure it's clear what I said. I said the corporate payment sales, which are both, what we call payables internally and cross-border. Collectively, that book was up 80% year-over-year. So that's the first one. 
 And then the second point is, yes, cross-border implements quickly payables does not. So to the extent that some amount of that incremental growth is in payables, it's actually a 2024 benefit more than is 2023. But on the guide, I don't have in front of me, my guess is that we're still guiding in the overall to 20% plus in the Corporate Payments business. And I don't know if you guys are hearing it, but it's kind of working. Sales are working, revenue is working. So it's -- we're -- the trends are certainly in a good spot. 
Kenneth Suchoski: Yes, totally. And then, Ron, I guess just real quick, just on the strategic review and the separation, sales, spending, et cetera. I mean are there certain kind of segments that stand out in terms of having a greater opportunity to create more value? And anything else that you see just on the dissynergies, I know you mentioned some of the overlap in the customer base, but just anything on dissynergies as you think about the different segments? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Again, I think the strategic review of what we call value creation plan, it's just pretty complicated. So that's why I try to tick through kind of the 4 different pieces, kind of how we operationalize review, right? From the Russia thing, which is kind of a political and emotional thing to the noncore assets of the fleet reinvention to the separation. And so we're full speed ahead as you heard on the Russia thing, we're full-speed ahead on the noncore businesses, including a couple of small things that sit inside the vehicle business. 
 So I think the question everyone has, we really have 3 big businesses, right? We have fleet, lodging and Corporate Payments. And I think people are focused on fleet, which is half the company or 40% and Corporate Payments. So that's really where we're focusing the attention on the separation. Would the company be better off if fleet and corporate payments were not all part of the same mothership, but in some way, separate, whichever one was separated. So I'd say that's the primary issue, if you will, question that we're trying to answer. And as I mentioned before, we're looking not only pure separation or stand-alone separation, but looking at the idea of some combination in parallel with the thing. So that's what we're working on. 
 And yes, unfortunately, in any separation, there's dissynergies. I mean, to me, it takes away the most important thing, which is really the ability to sell something where you can get a defined price. I'd like to know what something is and have my eyes open. And so losing whatever, 25% or 20% after the cost base makes a straight sale of one of those businesses pretty difficult. You got to get a really good price, right, to cover that tax dissynergy, but there we're looking really particularly around both IT and management, right? Which is what IT is co-mingled and how would we run the stuff manage early. So we're kind of digging through all that and want to make sure that any thing that we pull that it would be worth it, right? That the benefits would far out weigh the cost here. So we're still working it. And we did commit to it to work because we can't study it forever. We're going to have an answer when we talk in 90 days. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Sheriq Sumar with Evercore ISI. 
Sheriq Sumar: I have a question on the tags business, on the Brazil tag business, strong growth of around 15% and tag growth was like around 7% and strong sales growth too. Can you talk about what's working in terms of the products? The take rates in that segment was also up pretty much sequentially. So what's driving the take rate higher? And how should we think about the take rates for 3Q and 4Q from here? Any color would be appreciated. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I think. First of all, I think it's a great question because it highlights the pivot and strategy there, right, that what you said, the volume of tag is up 7% of the revenue, the revenue is up double. And so 2 points. One is the volume is healthy, partly because we keep widening the distribution channels. So in the last year, we signed 2 of the 5 biggest banks in Brazil to sell our stuff, our Sem Parar tags. And so those things are pretty added at that channel doesn't cannibalize much the other ways that we sell tag. So we're reaching prospective customers that we weren't reaching before. So that's a super helpful. 
 The second one is the take rate and the incremental growth is really from the add-ons. So the fuel that we're selling back to the tag holders is compounding. I don't have it in front of me, call it, 40% or 50%. And then these insurance add-ons, vehicle insurance add-ons, for like contents and micro insurance are crazy in demand. And so we're bolting incremental revenue on to the same account without adding any more tags. And so I think that's what we said to everybody was the idea that business was keep expanding distribution to sell more tags. But because we have millions and millions of customers there, find more things that are vehicle-related like fuel and parking and insurance that we could add on and the answer is we are. And just as a reminder, in the first quarter, I think almost 40% of the spend in Brazil was beyond toll. So lots and lots now of purchasing there is beyond toll products. And so that's the idea for the business. 
Unknown Executive: Yes. Like I have said in my prepared remarks, it was right at just under 40% this quarter again in terms of our B2C customer base. In terms of how much revenues coming from products other than our tag subscription. So it's showing good success. And their sales success has been just continuing to add to the momentum of that business. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Just on to things get tired or whatever the sales, the absolute sales year-to-date or at a record level. And for the last 3 years, every year, it's been a record level of overall sales versus the prior year. So there's been no slowdown at the rate that we're reaching new customers. So again, it's another business that I'd say is working. 
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. So this concludes your conference for today. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-05-03 14:45:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the FLEETCOR Technologies First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jim Eglseder, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
James Eglseder: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our first quarter 2023 earnings call. With me today are Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO; Tom Panther, our new CFO; and Alissa Vickery, our Chief Accounting Officer. Following their prepared comments, the operator will announce the queue will open for the Q&A session. It is only then that you can get in line for questions.
 Please note that our earnings release and supplement can be found under the Investor Relations section of our website at fleetcor.com. Now throughout this call, we will be covering organic growth. As a reminder, this metric neutralizes for the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and fuel spreads. It also includes pro forma results for acquisitions closed during the 2 years being compared.
 We will also be covering non-GAAP financial metrics, including revenues, net income and net income per diluted share, all on an adjusted basis. These measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than other companies. Reconciliations of the historical non-GAAP to the most directly comparable GAAP information can be found in today's press release and on our website.
 I also need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today may include forward-looking statements. These statements reflect the best information we have as of today, and all statements about our outlook, new products and expectations regarding business development and future acquisitions are based on that information. They are not guarantees of future performance, and you should not put undue reliance upon them. We undertake no obligation to update any of these statements.
 These expected results are also subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K and in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available on our website and at sec.gov.
 With that out of the way, I will turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay. Jim, thanks. Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q1 '23 earnings call. Also joining us here today is Tom Panther, our new CFO, who is now official, so delighted to have Tom here with us. Upfront here, I'll plan to cover 4 subjects: first, provide my take on Q1 results; second, I'll share our updated full year 2023 guidance; third, discuss progress on our value creation and simplification plan; and then lastly, I'll comment briefly on our newly formed strategic review committee.
 Okay. Let me turn to our Q1 results. We reported revenue of $901 million, up 14%, and cash EPS of $3.80. That's up 4%. Both results finished above the top of our guidance range. The cash EPS of $3.80 clearly weighed down predominantly by higher interest expense. At constant interest expense for the quarter, cash EPS would have been $4.30, up 17%, so our model's intact.
 The macro environment did cooperate, basically coming in as we anticipated. EBITDA for Q1 exceeded $460 million, up 17%. Margins there, up 100 basis points year-over-year. We invested incrementally about another 100 basis points of margin and a set of capability acquisitions from 2022, those intended to better position the company for the midterm.
 Trends in the quarter, quite good. Organic revenue growth, Q1 was up 12% overall. That accelerated sequentially and is above our 9% to 11% target range. Same-store sales finished plus 3%, so healthy. Retention finished at 91%, slightly impacted by the credit actions we took in Q4 to contain credit risk in the micro segment. That does drive a bit of involuntary attrition. Sales performance, absolutely terrific in the quarter, up 31%, setting new record levels of new bookings. So look, fundamentals, in a good spot.
 I do want to highlight our Brazil performance in Q1. So that business, really doing a nice job of transforming from a toll-centric business initially to now a broader vehicle payments business, again, for both businesses and consumers. The vehicle-related payments now include not only tolls but fuel, parking, fast food and recently now even vehicle insurance. Another super good sales quarter for Brazil, new toll tags, record level, and those were helped by a new bank relationship with Santander, which added almost 15% to the overall sales in the quarter.
 We also had terrific fuel transaction growth, up 39%, as we continue to increase the fueling acceptance sites. But most surprisingly in the quarter is, of our approximately 5 million active consumer users there, 3 million utilized our new Sem Parar app, mobile app in the quarter. And that engagement helped drive almost a 15% attach rate of insurance policy add-on sales, so consumers coming to the app, looking around, seeing offers and actually transacting with us. So we think this engagement opens up big-time cross-sell opportunities. So look, all in all, a very good start here to Q1. Sales, revenues, profits, all of those above our expectations.
 Okay. Let me shift gears and turn to our updated full year 2023 guidance along with assumptions behind it. So we're revising full year revenue and cash EPS guidance up by our Q1 beat, so revenue at the midpoint now of $3.840 billion and cash EPS at the midpoint now, $17.15. We are expecting the rest of year environment to be pretty consistent with what we forecasted 90 days ago, a few puts and takes but overall in the same place.
 Also, we've got an early view of April trends and results, so continuing to track to our plan. I do want to point out that we're expecting rest of year organic revenue growth in the 9% to 11% range. Inside of that, fuel improving to kind of mid-single digits, Brazil and Lodging in the mid-teens and Corporate Payments in the high teens.
 We're expecting rest of year earnings to accelerate. That'll be driven by these record levels of sales flowing into the second half, a stronger Q2 and Q3 seasonality; again, a second half fuel acceleration driven really by the pivot in sales in that business from micro to a bit up market. We'll see better operating leverage as we run through the year. Revenues will expand faster than expenses. That should result in EBITDA margins in Q4 about 200 to 250 basis points better than last year. Second half EPS will also improve mostly as we lap the interest expense and higher bad debt levels that we experienced last year. 
 Finally, we will keep a close eye out for any signs of macro weakness so that we can react quickly if we need to. Again, our solutions are generally pretty essential, pretty important. And demand for our services tends to actually run higher in inflationary times.
 Okay. Let me transition to the progress that we're making on our value creation or simplification plan. So we're working across 3 areas there: first, to eliminate overhang related to the Russia and FTC case; we're working to reduce complexity and present a simpler company; and finally, EV, we're working to demonstrate that we can basically succeed in this energy transition.
 So first up, Russia. We have signed definitive documents now to sell our Russia business to a local firm. We're awaiting a Russian government approval for the deal. And if we can get through the various hoops here, we would expect to close at the end of the quarter, the end of Q2. Tom Panther will provide some additional details on the impact of the transaction.
 Okay. Next up, the FTC case. So not much new to report here. As a reminder, both we and the FTC filed proposed orders back in February outlining some additional disclosure enhancements that we have been discussing with the court. So now it's really up to the court to decide what the conclusions will be and what the order will be. Given again that these are disclosure-related subjects, we continue to believe the court order will not have a material impact on the go-forward financial performance of the company.
 Over to simplification, we are evaluating ways to simplify our company. Three things under consideration: first, we are actively exploring the divestiture now of a few noncore assets, so that's underway; second, we're considering moving to 3 reporting segments versus today's 5; and then lastly, we're continuing to evaluate a brand change for the entire company to Corpay that would better reflect really the broad set of corporate payments solutions that we're offering. So expect to make decisions on these simplification ideas over the next 90 days.
 Okay. Let me make the turn to EV and reference Pages 11, 12 and 13 in our earnings supplement. So we've launched a pretty unique solution, the EV solution in the U.K. We call it our 3-in-1 solution. So that solution provides our fleet clients with a single program, one program where they can make traditional diesel purchases, on-road public EV recharging and manage at-home EV recharging and reimbursement, so 3 in 1.
 The early indications are that the EV economics could actually be favorable to us. So we looked at a sample, 271 clients in the U.K. that have been with us over the last 8 quarters, and examined the revenue pattern. And what you can see in the supplement is that the EV revenue per vehicle is actually higher than our ICE revenue per vehicle. So although early days, really pretty good news. So the driver here has really the need for businesses to measure and reimburse recharging and potentially, in our case, 1 million homes, right, the number of users we have. So it will be quite a task.
 I also want to point out that we're continuing to pursue the consumer EV payment opportunity so providing some potential upside to the EV energy transition. Since we are building, acquiring EV networks and EV technology for the B2B market, we decided to repurpose those capabilities to serve consumers. So underway doing that in Europe, we're building a consumer EV payment business. We've signed 10 EV vehicle manufacturers, and we're serving their new EV consumer buyers. So when a new EV consumer drives off a lot, they will be using our EV network and payment app, so out of the blocks there.
 Okay. Let me make the turn to my last subject, which is our new strategic review committee, formed to evaluate the portfolio options for the company. So we did retain Goldman Sachs to support the assignments. They have shared their preliminary analysis and thoughts with both the committee and our Board. I do want you to know we're taking this portfolio assessment quite seriously, and we're evaluating really all options to potentially increase shareholder value.
 I want you to know that I am personally aligned here with shareholders, both in terms of the importance of re-rating our multiple but also the urgency of doing so. So early days, but we're digging in. We're evaluating options. We're meeting folks. We're sizing dissynergies. We're getting at it. We do expect to have much more to report when we speak again in 90 days.
 So look, in closing, again, Q1 out of the blocks in a good way, ahead of our expectations. Our rest of year guide, up, assuming 9% to 11% organic revenue growth with improving margins and earnings, working aggressively to close out our Russia and FTC overhangs, begin communicating hopefully a simpler company and advancing the EV capabilities. And lastly, as I just said, we are just underway evaluating portfolio separation options, so a lot going on.
 So with that, let me turn the call over to Tom Panther, our new CFO, to provide some additional details on the quarter. Tom? 
Tom Panther: Thanks, Ron. It's great to be formally onboard and to have joined the FLEETCOR team at such an exciting time. The last several weeks have been a great opportunity for me to learn the business by spending in-depth time with our people to better understand our markets, products, sales strategies, key initiatives, technology and much more. There is more for me to learn, but the team has been incredibly helpful, accelerating my journey up the learning curve.
 I'm impressed by the exceptional talent and high-caliber capabilities that support the organization. FLEETCOR has a proven track record of generating strong top line growth and accretive operating leverage, and I can see why it's able to deliver those sustained high-quality results. I'm looking forward to digging in and helping the company achieve its business, strategic and financial objectives, and I'm confident in FLEETCOR's growth prospects, both organic and inorganic moving forward.
 And we need to look no farther than the first quarter results to understand why I'm confident in the company's future. As Ron mentioned, we posted 14% revenue growth in the quarter, including 12% organic growth. The incremental 2% of reported growth was due to acquisitions made last year as the macro fuel and FX factors were mostly a push versus prior year. Revenue of $901 million exceeded our guidance by $19 million, which flowed through to our $0.15 beat in cash EPS of $3.80.
 Moving on to the segments. I want to point out that we changed our organic growth solution disclosures to match the segment reporting that we implemented last year. Going forward, both reported and organic results will be disclosed in Fleet, Corporate Payments, Lodging, Brazil and other. This will be cleaner and eliminate any confusion between segment and solution categories. We've provided organic growth information on this basis for the last 8 quarters on Slide 7 of our earnings supplement, and we've provided a map in the appendix so you can track these classification changes.
 Now on to the quarter. Organic revenue growth was 12% as we delivered results 2% above guidance, reflecting the strong diversification of our business and the realization of strong sales results from last year across all of our businesses. This is despite the intentional strategy to pivot our U.S. fleet sales upmarket to mitigate credit exposure. Our Corporate Payments revenue grew 19%, led by our direct Corpay payables business, which was up over 30%, driven by continuing strong sales, especially in full AP automation. Our solutions are selling well in the marketplace, and we continue to believe that we have attractive and differentiated offerings that will drive future growth over time.
 Cross border revenue was up 21%, which is normalized for the Global Reach acquisition in January. The cross border team had another very good quarter as new sales and customer wins remained strong while also substantially completing the Global Reach integration, which is underscored by 90% of the Global Reach revenue already migrated to our platform.
 Fleet revenue increased 6% on a reported basis, driven by higher volume. Organically, when we isolate the impact of fuel prices, Fleet grew 3%, in line with our expectations. This reflects the continued drag from the weakness in the micro SMB fleet and the recent change in sales focus to a slightly larger customer. We are seeing good success from our sales pivot with sales trends continuing to improve, and we feel good about our ability to reaccelerate the growth in the back half of the year.
 Brazil revenue was up 18% compared to last year as the business continues to perform at an extremely high level. Our strategy of using the vehicle and now the Sem Parar mobile app for additional purchases like fuel, insurance and certain retail purchases continues to grow, which significantly expands the addressable market across B2B and B2C. We have transformed the Brazil business beyond a single-product toll tags business. It really is the center of an entire vehicle payment ecosystem that continues to grow, and we're the only provider that offers this breadth in the market. We have a highly differentiated value proposition in the marketplace and it is clearly winning share.
 Lodging continued to perform well, growing 26%. This solid performance highlighted by strong sales across our industry verticals that reflect our success in driving innovation to win new clients and capturing more business from existing clients. In addition, revenue per night increased 24% due to customer mix and additional fee-based revenue sources as we continue to expand our product capabilities. Our near-term focus is on consolidating our various hotel networks into one  in order to enhance the customer experience.
 Looking further down the income statement. Operating expenses were $526 million, representing a 12% increase over the prior year, primarily due to the addition of the Global Reach operations and the capability acquisitions we made last year, like Plugsurfing in the EV space. The remaining increase in operating expense was primarily in Corporate Payments and Lodging, where we generated significant operating leverage.
 Bad debt expense was 8 basis points but more importantly, slightly down sequentially from Q4 '22. Our delinquency trends give us confidence that we're on the path to lower bad debt expense in the back half of the year, even after giving consideration to a potentially soft macroeconomic cycle.
 The EBITDA margin in the quarter was 51%, 100 basis points better than Q1 '22. This includes $11 million or about 100 basis points of drag from expenses associated with recent acquisitions, including integrating and building out our AP automation and EV capabilities that we bought last year. We still expect our full year EBITDA margin to increase approximately 150 basis points compared to last year and Q4 to exit the year 200 to 250 basis points higher than Q4 '22. Remember, margins expand throughout the year as we generate revenue growth and realize the benefits of synergies from recent acquisitions.
 Interest expense increased by $58 million year-over-year, driven by higher rates on our debt stack. The impact of higher interest rates resulted in approximate $0.49 drag on first quarter adjusted EPS. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.1% versus 26% last year, with the increase driven primarily by increases in tax rates in some international jurisdictions and some onetime discrete items. We anticipate the quarterly effective tax rate for the rest of the year to be between 26% and 27%.
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with about $1.3 billion in unrestricted cash, and we had $779 million available on our revolver. There was $5.5 billion outstanding on our credit facilities, and we had $1.3 billion borrowed in our securitization facility. As of March 31, our leverage ratio was 2.7x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement. We made no open market share repurchases in the quarter as we deployed roughly $230 million in capital for 3 deals, including Global Reach while also maintaining our leverage ratio.
 I would like to remind you that our first port of call for capital deployment is always accretive acquisitions. And then if there's nothing near term, we'll evaluate buybacks or debt paydowns as appropriate. We still have over $1.2 billion authorized for share repurchases, and we believe we have ample liquidity to pursue near-term M&A opportunities and continue to buy back shares when it makes sense.
 In addition to Ron's overview of our full year guidance, let me give some additional detail, including some thoughts on our Q2 outlook and supporting assumptions, which can be found on Slide 14. For the full year, we now expect GAAP revenues between $3.82 billion and $3.86 billion, adjusted net income between $1.263 billion and $1.303 billion, adjusted net income per diluted share between $16.95 and $17.35, and finally, EBITDA growth of 15%. All of these numbers include Russia for the full year.
 Assuming a June 30 close of our Russia business, we expect GAAP revenues to be $55 million to $65 million lower, resulting in a $0.30 to $0.40 decline in adjusted EPS based on using the sale proceeds for buybacks over the remainder of the year.
 I also want to emphasize that the transaction is subject to approval by the Russian government, which involves an added level of complexity. For the second quarter, we're expecting revenue to be between $930 million and $950 million and adjusted net income per share to be between $4.02 and $4.22, which at the midpoint is down slightly from what we reported in Q2 of 2022, which is driven by higher interest expense of approximately $60 million and roughly $20 million of expected macro headwinds from fuel price and FX rates.
 Related to our guidance assumptions, we are using $3.99 as our fuel price assumption for the rest of the year. Our interest expense guidance of $310 million to $330 million is based off an average LIBOR rate of 4.9% for the rest of the year. The rest of our assumptions can be found in our press release and supplement.
 Finally, I'd like to thank our 10,000-plus employees around the world who helped deliver a fantastic start to 2023. This quarter's results and our go-forward prospects reinforce the power of our growth-oriented, diversified business and the strength of our franchise.
 Thank you for your interest in FLEETCOR. And now operator, we'd like to open the line for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] 
 Our first question comes from Pete Christiansen with Citi. 
Peter Christiansen: Tom, welcome aboard here. Great to have you. I had 2 questions here. There's a lot to dig into. But Ron, I guess now with the new segmentation, how should we think about long-term kind of normalized growth for the Fleet business now that we've added some other things to that segment? I know in the past, you've talked about the segment being kind of like 4% to 8%. Does that change with the new classification? And perhaps maybe we could also address Brazil in that same vein. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Pete, it's Ron. So I'd say kind of in the base business based on how we're allocating sales and marketing investment, we're probably still in that target range, kind of mid-single digits. But I think the couple of wild cards on it are AEV, right? Does that thing, particularly with the early view we're getting of the economics, does that help accelerate it along with that consumer leg? And then B, do we get the cross-sell thing to hunt a bit more? so I'd say the wildcard is those 2 things. If those 2 things come in, obviously could accelerate quite a bit. 
Peter Christiansen: Okay. That's helpful. I know the toll businesses in Brazil, switching to free flow. I know it's been a benefit to some toll payment administrators here in the U.S. when E-ZPass went free flow. Just curious your take on how that could impact the business nearer term. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, that's a good question. So, so far, it's good news. It's -- for those who don't know, it's pretty early days in Brazil in terms of trying to make the transition to free flow. So they're actually testing it in one region. So the good news on that for -- obviously, for the toll operator is, hey, there's no more gates and stopping people. The bad news is the, whatever, the 20% to 30% of the people that don't have electronic, have a [ clue folly ] way of paying after the fact.
 So it'll help us. It's a tailwind short term because it makes the electronic blast right through even more attractive than today because, again, it's more difficult for people to follow up after the fact. So we're actually seeing that, Pete, in the test region. So in the one place where they put it in, we're actually doing a bit better, so I'd say the only reason I get super excited. It'll probably take quite a while, right? There's a lot to test. There's a lot of infrastructure and stuff to move that post-payment thing to work out. So I don't think it's going to be super duper immediately but I'd say, over the midterm, helpful to us. 
Operator: The next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. 
Andrew Jeffrey: Ron, I wonder if you can update a little bit on the selling motion as you move up market in fuel. It sounds like you've met with some pretty good early success. But can you just kind of elaborate on what that looks like? Can you continue to go to market using primarily digital means? Is it more kind of feet on the street? Is there a pricing or yield difference on some of those bigger fleets? Just want to try to understand how that might compare to how the fuel business looks prior. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Andrew, another good question. So point one is we already sell up market, so although we don't say it, call it, I don't know, 40% of the sales even in the U.S. business are kind of not digital, 40% to 50%. So we're already kind of in the business is point one. And point two is, I'd say, even more so internationally, we have way longer time and see there with universal networks, so we sold a bigger account for a lot longer.
 But back here to the U.S. So the 2 ways that we'll kind of drift up market is, one, is repointing of our digital engine. So we basically kind of reworked the algorithm there to look for different kind of search characteristics. So we let through the door, if you will, we bid in a way basically to encourage bigger accounts to come to us and obviously kind of shun smaller accounts. So that's underway. We made that pivot, call it, last October, November, so that's already started to work.
 And then second, what you said. We're starting to grow now the feet on the street that would go into the seam. And what we're working on is what I mentioned to Pete, Andrew, a few minutes ago of maybe going to market with not only the fuel card but going to market with this Corpay One that kind of has the corporate payments stuff built into it to see if that might be a little bit more compelling. So we're kind of in test mode now of putting some people against a bit larger prospects and giving them something a little newer kind of interesting to say. So those are the couple of ideas. 
Andrew Jeffrey: Okay. That's helpful. And then I like the U.K. mixed fleet disclosure slide from a revenue standpoint. Is it safe to assume that you see similar unit economics or maybe think about it as contribution margin in addition to more revenue? In other words, is operating leverage in those mixed fleet EV offerings? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I'd say that's way too early to call, right? We've got a tiny, tiny, little EV business and set of assets and cost structure. So our 99% focus at this point is on the revenue side, right, and figuring out how to serve these clients and win. And I don't know if people think it's a big deal, but as I kind of dug through the data, I'll say to everybody, it is a big deal, right, that companies, real clients that we have are willing to pay us more money to be more helpful in more places, and if you look at the chart, kind of significantly more money.
 So that is way different than I think we would have thought 2 years ago getting into the thing. So what I would say people ought to focus on is the fact that we have it. I think I'm accurate in saying we're the only ones. There's no one else that has this 3-in-1 kind of offering that brings all the things together. So I'd say, come back, Andrew, a different day to me on the margin side, but there's nothing structurally that would make us think we couldn't be at the same level over time. It's just not we're on today. 
Operator: The next question comes from Sheriq Sumar with Evercore ISI. 
Sheriq Sumar: I just wanted to get a sense on the trends in the month that you saw in the first quarter as to was there a sequential decline in the month of March versus what you saw in Jan and Feb? Or was it highly consistent across all the months? And early read across how trends have been in April and any areas of weakness or strength that you have seen so far? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Sheriq, it's Ron. So no, I'd say, if anything, the months are increasing, why we're a snowball business where we add more than we lose. And I think -- I don't know, but probably March has more workdays, so it would have been a higher print. And I did call out we've had a pretty good peak here in April, both revenue and other trends that I'd say it's kind of spot on the plan, which obviously fits with the guidance. So we're still just not seeing much. We built a plan, whatever, a few months ago, and as you can hear from the results and the April comment, we kind of track in the -- right where we thought. 
Sheriq Sumar: One follow-up. On Corporate Payments, if I remember correctly, on the last quarter, you had mentioned that the growth will be around 20%, north of 20%, but now you had like around high teens, unless I'm wrong over here. So I just wanted to get a sense as to what's causing the difference in outlook for Corporate Payments? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Are you trying to pick on, hey, it's 19% instead of 20%? 
Sheriq Sumar: Yes. No, I thought it was more like 20-plus percent, so I thought it probably was more like a [ 50, 100 basis point ] of decline. Yes. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. If you go back and read kind of prior scripts, I would have said high teens to 20%. So 19%, I think qualifies as high teens. And I did say I think it's likely you will see in 1 of the next 2 or 3 quarters to think -- tick above the 20%. So again, we try to build, design that business to run right around the 20%, plus or minus, so still highly confident of that. 
Operator: The next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Ron, appreciate the commentary on the strategic review committee, and it seems like you're onboard. I know in the past, you've considered divestitures or sales of some of the businesses, and the price simply was not compelling enough. I'm just curious, one, has the backdrop changed in terms of that pricing? Or are you just willing to make the deal in the name of simplification? And then second, maybe you could just talk about core versus noncore, sort of how you guys are looking at this. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Sanjay, on the first part of your question, the backdrop has changed our value of our earnings, right? So historically, I'd say up until, call it, the last 1.5 years, we traded in the mid- to high teens EBITDA, kind of next 12 months EBITDA sort of trade at, call it, 10, 11x is the first part of the backdrop. So a price from a third party that would be a lot higher than where we are would be more interesting to me than it would have been when we traded obviously at 15% to 20%.
 So in terms of the segments, I'd say it's really the size of the businesses is how we think about things that are core. So things that are big for us have big leadership positions we would call core. And so if you know what those are, that would be Fleet, Brazil, Corporate Payments. Lodging for sure would be businesses that we would view as big and core and have great positions.
 But again, as I said in the opening comments, we're -- when you're trading for whatever reason at this level, we are -- starting with me, we are wide open to someone else other than who's in our stock, valuing some or all of the company at a more appropriate level. And so I do want to make sure people know we are out talking and trying to get feedback if we can ID people that would value some or all the business higher. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Okay. Okay. And then just a follow-up on the Russia sale. I guess, can you just elaborate a little bit on what specific approvals need -- are needed for the -- from the Russian authorities, I mean, how much time that takes if this presents a risk? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, that's also a good question. So I don't know how many months ago, somewhere 3 to 6 months ago, the Russian government created a separate, I don't know if you call it agency, commission, group, whatever it is, for this purpose of international western companies trying to exit and effectively created a sign-off requirement, almost like an antitrust or something, oversight. And so as western companies like us make deals, right, sign SPA to sell things, then these go to this group, this agency, this committee, whatever it is, and they opine on it. Hey, we're happy to approve this deal; or, hey, we'd like to see this or that.
 So that's what it is. We've been told that it's a month or 2. I think it's a function, right, of the volume of transactions that are in front of the group. But they have been -- we've looked at the history. As long as they've been established, they have been processing, one way or the other, transactions. So we do think, obviously, the buyer there is communicating to us that they're in conversations with this group, so it's in some kind of a process.
 Risk, yes, I've used the word. There's some hoops, so for us to say we know how that ball is going to bounce would not be accurate. So we have an agreement and assuming that it gets approved, we will transact. And our best guess, it's probably in the next 60 days. But I want people on the call, it is not risk free. There's obviously some chance that they would deny the sale or ask for changes in the sale that are unpalatable, and so we're just kind of waiting. 
Operator: The next question comes from Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research. 
Kenneth Suchoski: Tom, congrats on the new role. Great to connect again. It's great to hear the comments on the portfolio review and that you're moving quickly on that front. There have been some discussions going around that FLEETCOR should consider breaking up the business and maybe ring-fence some of the things that might be weighing on the multiple. So I guess, one, what is your preliminary analysis pointing to in terms of value creation as well as any dissynergies that need to be taken into account? And I guess if you were to go through with a potential corporate action, what might a separation look like and how should we think about the timing around that? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Ken, I'd say it's too early really to try to answer that. We're, whatever, 5 or 6 weeks into kicking this thing into gear and studying it. So we don't really have a super-formed view. I think I kind of said what I said, which is we're underway. We've run, tumbled a bunch of numbers. We're obviously out talking to people. So really, we're just working our way through the options, and as I said, would be in a way better spot for a clear answer to you in 90 days. 
Kenneth Suchoski: Okay. Okay. We'll wait on that, Ron. I guess as my follow-up, can you talk about the trends you're seeing on the corporate payments side? I mean it kind of feels like the current macro slowdown or recession looks a little different than '08, '09 and maybe businesses might be pulling back ahead of the consumer. So maybe you could just talk about how you're feeling about the spending trends in the Corporate Payments segment. And then any puts and takes across the underlying businesses within that segment? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Sure. I'd say that I think we report spend in some of the appendices here and stuff, so it continues to be strong really across the board. I think maybe most importantly is the sales are just record levels. I mean our Q1 sales in our Corporate Payments business was not only an all-time high. It was an all-time high by, I don't know, 50% or something. So we're pouring money into advertising the brand now and reaching more people. We've got more people on the street. We finally have a really put-together product line.
 So the -- I think the fill on the top of the bucket is in -- is really the best place that it's ever been in. So I think it's -- without getting over my skis, it's kind of all systems go, the things work in. Our outlook is to compound now, like I said, high teens to 20%. And other than the channel thing, which is, I don't know, 10%, 12% of the business now, really, all the other parts of that business are rocking. So no warning flags at all. 
Operator: The next question comes from Trevor Williams. 
Trevor Williams: I want to ask on corporate payments in the cross border business in particular. Maybe just a higher level if you could give us a refresher just on what differentiates you on the cross border and the FX side. And now with AFEX and Global Reach, just the main benefits you get with that added scale and then how that feeds into the durability of the growth that you're seeing there? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. That's really super good question, Trevor. The first and most important thing I think I'd say is who do we compete with. So how do we get business and who would we lose business to? And the answer is banks. And because we mostly serve the middle market, it's Tier 2 banks. So it's super important that everyone has that in the brand. We're playing little league. But maybe we're playing Minor League Baseball versus Major League Baseball.
 And so we have to be able to get a mid-sized business to trust us to make either spot or hedge transactions for them versus, let me call it, kind of a Tier 2 bank. So when you have that context, the answer is we got to win everywhere. We have a better network, right, in terms of basically the destination, if you will, of payments, more breadth, more countries. We have better tech because it's all we do versus a bank running or using some third party.
 But the winner, I think, Trevor, is the people. We just have more specialists, right? We have hundreds of people in these different originating markets here, Canada, U.K., Europe, Australia, that really know FX, that have grown up in FX. So I think they really just outthink and outpitch the representatives that are at these Tier 2 banks. And so it's the combo of all of those things. But we compete well because, honestly, who has the book of business would be my answer to you. 
Trevor Williams: Okay. Got it. And then on the Fleet segment, any help just on how we should think of the cadence of growth over the course of the year? Is the pivot of new sales to the larger customers as those start to flow through? Ron, I think you said earlier on, getting to the mid-single digits. But just any way you could put a finer point around timing and just as we're thinking of the next 3 quarters, just progression of growth in fleet would be helpful. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Super good question. I'd say think of it as just stepping up. So if it's, call it, 3 for the print for Q1, we're going to end middle kind of [ 3, 4, 5, 6, 3, 5, 6, 7 ]. It's going to step up basically based on the plan we've built. So kind of 1 point or so acceleration sequentially. 
Operator: The next question comes from Bob Napoli with William Blair. 
Spencer James: This is Spencer James on for Bob Napoli. The new sales definitely impressed us. Ron, could you maybe just provide a summary of what's driving the strength in new sales and the components of that number and what's driving the strength there? And then maybe if you could touch on how the digital ad environment might -- may or may not be impacting new sales motion. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I'm not so sure, Spencer, the second part of the question, but the first part, I can cover, which is, yes, it was a crazy good sales quarter, right? We're [ tallying guys ] up 31%, and that's in the face of taking the gas off of our North America Fleet business, right? We used to get, I don't know, 10%, 15% of the business in that micro segment, and I just shut it down, right, to try to contain. So it tells you that the rest of international fleet and all the rest of the businesses grew faster even to 31%.
 And I think it's a combo of things. One is, again, we've stepped up marketing and sales investment, particularly marketing. We've been pouring more money in corporate payments into this Corpay brand campaign, and so that's helping a lot. And then I'd say, second, I think we're finally getting the hang of digital leads, which is generating way more leads in every business. We have a couple of unique campaigns, digital campaigns, both in Fleet. We call one of them Barbara -- I feel like I'm naming boats or something here -- and one in our Lodging business called Sara.
 And so these campaigns that kind of create a bit of a personality in the space have been incredibly successful for us. So I don't want to say they're shooting fish in a barrel, but the sales force is getting fed with a lot more quality leads, call it, in the last year than they were before. So it's just all good. It's inflationary time, so we have kind of cost reduction products. We have better products than we have. We have more people on the street, and our lead thing is working better. So it's just -- I mean, I'd just say it's working, what we're doing. 
Spencer James: Great. And as a follow-up, maybe an update on credit and fraud trends in the Fleet business. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. So I don't know if we -- Alissa print that or not. So it's a smidgy bit better sequentially from Q4. And again, based on when we started to take the actions, most of the benefit in terms of improvement is expected in the second half. So we're seeing a lot kind of in our -- what we call our delinquency roll rates. So we're staring at the last week. We have super good visibility into Q2, which doesn't necessarily impact the credit reserve we'll take for this quarter but super does for the following quarter. So we can see that thing really coming down.
 So I don't know if we can take it to the bank yet, but the early warning, the early good news signs are that the actions we've taken are going to take credit losses down in the second half like we planned. And then same on the fraud side. The fraud side has been a combo of what we call application fraud, which are fully people pretending to be somebody and getting us. So we basically put in a bit of a new system that does way better at that, has a few more variables that it looks at before it says okay.
 And then the second one is just criminal fraud, right? People at a truck stop putting in skimming and selling cars and stuff. And so I think we're down 40% in fraud sequentially in those couple of areas. And our partners, like the truck stop partners, have been helpful in trying to police that better at the site. So as those numbers got bigger, right, because fuel prices, what, Q2, I guess, peaked last year, I'm going to say Q2, it became a more attractive target. And so it took time, I think, for us and others to get on it. So not mission accomplished yet, but we're making good progress. 
Operator: The next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. 
James Faucette: I had a couple of follow-up operational questions here. Retention in the quarter was really strong. I think it was like 91.2% but was down about 100 basis points from last quarter. And I know you just mentioned kind of the credit actions taken. But can you expand if there were any other factors driving that? Is there seasonality, et cetera, that we should be aware of? And how are you thinking about that for the remainder of the year? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, James, Ron again. No, that's it. I mean the reason it shows up there is what we call involuntary attrition, which is about half of our losses, right? So let's use 10% not to hurt our head. Hey, 10% of our customers quit us every year. We quit 5 of them, which means we get uncomfortable with your credit profile and so you're not our customer anymore.
 And so when you go through what we did of having greater -- heightened attention on these small-ish 1, 2, 3 kind of card accounts, we took actions basically to cut lines and pull back payment cycles and stuff really just obviously to contain losses. And so that just translates into us effectively kicking those clients out. So that's it. That's the totality of the thing. And I want everyone clear, we did it with our eyes just completely wide open. And based on what we're seeing, happy that we did it. In your opening comment, we're still -- work for ADP for 10 years and still super happy with a consolidated 91% revenue retention rate. So we're -- no tears here. 
James Faucette: Got it. And then just a follow-up on -- there's been a lot of conversation obviously on segments and strategy, et cetera. But from a realignment perspective, at least as you've redefined some of the segment definitions, any change to how that strategically impacts those businesses or planned go to market, et cetera? 
Ronald F. Clarke: That's really a super good question. Yes. Let me say what I think kind of the insight is, and it comes a little bit from how we started on kind of a product-centric view of our lines of business versus a market rider or a customer-centric view. And I think the Brazil guys that I called out at the top of the call, they've proven that if you want to redefine your business as, hey, I'm going to help vehicle-related drivers make payments, whether they're a business guy driving around or whether they're a consumer driving around, all those things that you pay related to the vehicles, right, fuel, toll, EV, maintenance, stopping for food, parking, now even insurance, that those things -- getting into those shows that the businesses and the consumers believe that our business has the right to offer to provision all of those payment things and having all those things on one account seems like a good idea to them.
 So I'd say that's kind of where we're headed. The idea would be to basically stop looking at the thing as, hey, you're driving around, and we're selling you one thing. Like go to Europe. We're now -- I said -- talked about the 3 in 1. Now we're selling fleets, but we're also selling old-fashioned diesel and EV. Why can't we sell parking and toll and insurance to those sets of millions of users and stuff? And so I think that's the strategic turn for us, is to think about really the multiple things we could sell to the same customer that makes sense to them.
 And the great news is we have a live case, like a real case to that. And the other thing I'm guessing people missed is the phone, right? The mobile phone is starting to matter. Like I tell you that 3 million out of 5 million users, consumers in Brazil decided to go to our phone app in a month. I don't know if that's crazy to you guys, but it is to me. We used to stick a tag on the windshield, and now 60% of the people are on their phone in our app looking for stuff. And so that creates, I think, an enormous ability again to offer up, like the insurance example, more things to the customer base. So we're going to -- the headline is we're looking at the world more through the lens of the customer and what we can offer than we are product by product. 
Operator: The next question comes from Jeff Cantwell with Wells Fargo. 
Jeffrey Cantwell: And just to follow up on some of the questions about core versus noncore and you giving us a ton of color on this. I just wanted to bounce something off you and see if you would agree that this is a fair statement that, over the years, amongst Fleet, Corporate Payments and Lodging, there would be potentially a number of operational synergies amongst those 3 segments. And so the clear follow-up question to that would be could you maybe give us some comments on Brazil within the context of core versus noncore. Just curious how that piece of your business ties in with the rest. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I think Jeff, I kind of just said it. To me, in some ways, Brazil is the lead dog, is kind of the poster child for really how we should think about the portfolio, right? That, hey, when we bought that business 7 years ago, it was mostly a toll-centric business, and it's transformed, right, in the -- like I said, selling 5 or 6 things to the same, both businesses and consumers. And notice how we're selling EV, right, to both businesses and consumers. We're just basically repurposing the networks and the tech. Well, obviously, that's what Brazil has done, right?
 They've got toll networks that both use. They've got fuel networks that both use. They have parking that both use. So they've literally taken the same networks and tech and sold the stuff to the 2 different groups. So I'd say, if anything, that business looks more related. The other thing, which is so weird, is fleet's in 8 giant markets today. Fleet's not only in the U.S.A. It's in, obviously, the U.K. It's in Czech. It's in Germany. It's in Russia. It's in Australia. It's in Canada. Obviously, it's in Brazil. Obviously, we have a Fleet business that's in 8 geographies, of which 1 of them just happens to be Brazil.
 So our lenses are, in some ways, it might be the -- it is -- the most related business in the company to our Fleet business would be our Brazil business because all of it is another country doing fleet, vehicle stuff. So I would say that would be a super duper long shot. The only thing is I like businesses that are working, just as an aside. So the fact that the business is compounding in the teens and pressed at about the 50% EBITDA line and beaten down people that are giving things away for free and continuing to compound, we like that. I mean I like that like a lot, the performance of the business. 
Jeffrey Cantwell: Okay. And my follow-up is for Tom. For those of us who have not covered you at your prior, would you maybe just, if you don't mind, give us a sense of how you think strategically and also conceptually about managing the business and so forth? Would love to get your thoughts on what your mindset is as you're coming onboard here. 
Tom Panther: Sure, Jeff. Look forward to working with you and good to work with many of you on the call that did cover EVO. My DNA as a finance person is really to approach it from a business-centric perspective. I've had the benefit over the last month or so being able to participate in a variety of meetings here, really learning the company firsthand, and getting grounded in how the business operates is centric to how I and the rest of the team within finance thinks and supports the business.
 Our role is to make sure we bring good information and good advice and ideas to the business. And we can't do that by just looking at the output of the results. I've said repeatedly over the course of my career, I like focusing on the inputs in order to drive the outputs. And my dialogue and the team's dialogue with the business is around their KPIs. And if we can get their focus on their KPIs and how those KPIs drive the kind of outcomes that we're looking for financially, then the company wins.
 So you'll find me and again, the rest of the team very focused on making sure that we understand how the business is operating and how we can help it become more and more successful. Very focused on things up and down the income statement and balance sheet, so no real bias there. It's where the opportunity is, is where we'll focus. 
Operator: The next question comes from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. 
Mihir Bhatia: My first question just has to do with the consumer EV build-out that you kind of mentioned, Ron. Can you maybe expand on that? Is the idea there to build a FLEETCOR consumer brand? Or are you white labeling? Is the -- I mean, I guess, based on some of your other comments about Brazil, is the thinking there that using EV instead of tolls, you can do something similar on the consumer side as what they have done in Brazil using tolls as the wedge if you will? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, that's a good question. So as I mentioned at the top, the motivation initially here is repurposing assets we have, which are networks, right, in tech. But your comment about brand is a good one. So the first thing I'd say is some of that build initially will be under other people's brands, where we'll be kind of Intel Inside. So what I mean by that is think of us going to an EV car manufacturer. Pick Volvo, Renault, somebody who's making EV cars and they want to give their new buyers an easy way to find public recharging and pay for it. They're going to use our network and our app.
 The brand and sometimes even the app will get pulled into Renault's or Volvo's way, right, of communicating. So that's one, so leveraging kind of the carmaker's brand to get to those drivers. And then the second one is kind of the CPOs, the gas stations, if you will, the charge point operators is what they call them. Same thing, we would go to someone that's got 100 charge points and has customers coming in that wants them to be able to roam to go to places other than their 100. They would be trying to sign those customers up and get them under an app that we would provide them. So that's the first headline, is that some amount of our consumer business would leverage these intermediary brands.
 But lastly, I think it is a good idea. We have this brand, this company we bought called Plugsurfing, which, I guess, kind of sounds like an EV brand. So yes, we're not going to use, for sure, the FLEETCOR brand. We want something that's representative of EV. And so we might invest. We may take a market, to your point, and invest digitally to see if we can build that brand and add some consumers directly. But that's for a different day. 
Mihir Bhatia: Understood. And then just switching gears to this year, and obviously, you're seeing some sales momentum that you've highlighted. But just in general, as you sit here today, do you think things are getting better or worse relative to 3 months ago? Because there's a lot of conflicting data. I guess, from your -- the data you are seeing, are you seeing any pockets of weakness across your offerings? Or is it really just the macro is the only -- like outside macro is a big question mark for you? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I know it's the question on everyone's mind, but I guess I'd make a couple of points. So first is our best internal metric here is what we call same-store sales, which basically isolates existing clients in the period that we had in the same period a year ago and just ask, hey, are they getting healthier or sicker, and the answer is healthier. So across our -- across the globe, at least among our clients, they're plus 3% healthier than they were 12 months ago. So that's kind of point one.
 The second point is our company that grows revenues double digit and grows profits faster isn't super reliant on GDP. I don't know what our GDP is here in the U.S. or in some of our big markets, but let's say it's 1% or 2%. We're growing by gaining share, right? We sell way more than we lose. So the growth rate and potential of our company is way more in our control of being able to sell way more businesses at the top of the bucket and lose less businesses at the bottom. If the existing clients shrink 1 point or so, oh, woe is me for a quarter or 2 maybe, but that's not our game.
 Our game is to basically power through, either happier or a little bit sadder, GDP kind of environment. So again, we're not seeing much, and frankly, I think it's -- the impact, it's at the margin for us. 
Operator: This has concluded our question-and-answer session, and the conference has also now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may all now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-08 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. 
 I would now like to turn the conference over to Jim Eglseder, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
James Eglseder: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings call. With me today are Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO; and Alissa Vickery, our Interim CFO. Following the prepared comments, the operator will announce that the queue will open for the Q&A session. It is only then that you can get in line for questions. Please note, our earnings release and supplement can be found under the Investor Relations section of our website at fleetcor.com.
 Now throughout this call, we will be covering organic revenue growth. And as a reminder, this metric neutralizes the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and fuel spreads. It also includes pro forma results for acquisitions closed during the 2 years being compared. We will also be covering non-GAAP financial metrics, including revenues, net income and net income per diluted share, all on an adjusted basis. These measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than that at other companies. Reconciliations of the historical non-GAAP to the most directly comparable GAAP information can be found in today's press release and on our website.
 I do need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today may include forward-looking statements. These statements reflect the best information we have as of today. All statements about our outlook, new products and expectations regarding business development and future acquisitions are based on that information. They are not guarantees of future performance, and you should not put undue reliance upon them. We undertake no obligation to update any of these statements. These expected results are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release, on Form 8-K and on our annual report on Form 10-K, both filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available on our website and at sec.gov. 
 So now with that out of the way, I will turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay, Jim. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone, and appreciate you joining our Q4 2022 earnings call. At the top here, I'll plan to cover 4 subjects. So first, I'll provide my take on our Q4 results. Second, I'll recap our full year 2022 performance. Third, I'll share our initial 2023 guidance. And then lastly, I'll update you on a few of the key priorities that we're working.
 Okay. Let me make the turn to our Q4 results, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range, so better than we expected. We reported revenue of $884 million, that's up 10%; and cash EPS of $4.04, that's up 9%. Our cash EPS was helped in the quarter by a Brazil tax-happy which did lower our Q4 overall tax rate. Organic revenue growth coming in at 7% overall. Inside of that, our corporate payments business, super good, growing 20% in the quarter.
 Against the prior year, our Q4 organic revenue growth was negatively impacted by about, I don't know, $20 million to $25 million of onetime revenues sitting in Q4 of '21, so that reduced organic revenue growth by about 2% to 3% in Q4. We do expect Q1 2023 organic growth to return to the 9% to 10% range. 
 Cash EPS in the quarter pressured by both higher bad debt and significantly higher interest expense. And as a result of the rising delinquencies we're seeing in our U.S. fuel business, we did make the decision in Q4 to slow what we call our new micro-digital sales, so our very smallest account. We also began tightening terms of our existing SMB account. 
 Both of those things really a cautionary move to try to control bad debt expense here in 2023. Fortunately, our credit risk is really narrowly concentrated in what we call these very small micro-accounts and also in our newest vintages, think 12 to 24 months. So it really impacts a pretty small portion of our overall business. 
 Turning to the trends. Fundamentals in the quarter are quite good. Same-stores finished plus 2% for the quarter, retention remaining steady at 92%, and sales grew 19% in the quarter despite our decision to again to slow the micro sales and fuel. So look, all in all, a bit better finish than we had expected and continuing strong trends helping us here as we roll into '23.
 Okay, let me turn to our full year 2022 performance along with the progress that we made to better position the company for the midterm. So for the full year 2022, we reported revenue of $3.4 billion. That's up 21% and up almost $600 million over 2021. Cash EPS of $16.10, that's up 22% versus prior year and a full $0.85 ahead of our initial 2022 guidance. Our full year organic revenue growth of 13%. Full year sales or new bookings growth of 21%, and we closed 5 capability acquisitions, if you include the GRG deal on January 1. So really good, really outstanding performance against the primary objectives that we set. 
 So in addition to the financial goals, we really did advance pretty meaningfully our Beyond strategy in '22 in which we extend either or both the product set of the business or the customer segment that we serve. This is helpful, obviously, because it grows the TAM and obviously better positions the business for long-term growth. 
 So just a few of our Beyond highlights for 2022. So in global fleet, significant progress on our EV capabilities. We acquired a European public charging network. We've got mapping and payment applications. We've got at-home charging software and we've integrated all that to our ICE fueling solution, so great progress there. 
 In corporate payments, we added an AP automation software front end to our whole AP payment execution business, which is the company's fastest-growing business, so super delighted with that. In lodging, we've gone beyond our workforce, core workforce business, to 2 new verticals, the airline vertical and the insurance vertical, each of those reaching almost $100 million in revenue in '22. And then finally in Brazil, we keep expanding our tag fueling solution. We've gone to even more accepting sites now and more users and I think, exiting Q4, reached about 10 million annualized transactions. So look, the combo in '22 of really good financial performance and what I'd call significant strategic progress. So we're quite pleased.
 All right. Let me shift gears and make the turn to our 2023 outlook. We've worked hard to build a plan to meet our most important objectives in what is a challenging environment. So here is our 2023 guidance at the midpoint. So revenue of $3.825 billion, that would be up 12% or approximately $400 million. EBITDA of $2.025 billion, that reflects up 15% or up about $260 million. And then cash EPS of $17 at the midpoint, that would reflect up 6%. We're certainly outlooking a pretty unfavorable macro environment this year with a smidge lower fuel price and significantly higher interest rates. So those 2 things are expected to reduce our 2023 cash EPS by about $1.75, implying we'd be giving an $18.75 cash EPS guide in kind of an apples-to-apples environment. 
 Our '23 plan does set out a number of pretty important objectives: to deliver organic growth 10%-plus, to grow new sales 15%-plus and to diet or control our operating expenses with a plan to expand margins about 150 basis points for the full year and 200 basis points exiting 2023. 
 Major assumptions underlying our 2023 guidance are, first, that our '22 acquisitions will add about 2% to 3% to our 2023 print revenue growth. This '23 guidance does include Russia and will until we have certainty of the divestiture. Guidance assumes that we can manage bad debt equal to the 2022 level, although we do think it will be more elevated in the first half than the second half. And then finally, we have not assumed a U.S. or global recession but rather built our '23 plan and volumes really just based on what we can see and projected from there. 
 Our confidence in this '23 plan or outlook is bolstered by a few things. First, we've now seen our '22 finish good, better than we thought. We closed the Global Reach cross-border deal, so that's in our numbers. We've made expense cuts already so those are behind us. We're seeing some recent improvement, slight but improvement, in both fuel price and FX trends. We just recently implemented 2 interest rate swaps that will lower our 2023 interest expense and obviously fix rates. And then lastly, we qualified for Brazil tax-happy that will slightly lower our 2023 consolidated tax rate, a bit better than our earlier expectations. 
 Okay, let me transition to my last subject, which is an update on some of our important priorities. So Russia, let me start out with Russia, so making good progress on the sale of our Russia business. We've had lots of interest, a number of parties that have bid for the asset. And we've recently moved a select group of buyers, potential buyers, into the diligence phase. Timing is probably somewhere late Q2. And at this point, our plan would be to use the Russia sale proceeds to buy back FLT stock. If we did that with kind of a midyear close, we're looking at about $0.30 to $0.35 of in-year cash EPS dilution.
 Okay, let me turn next to the FTC matter. Appears to be finally in the home stretch. We're at a point now where we do expect the court to issue an order likely here sometime in Q1, detailing incremental processes and disclosures that we'll need to implement. So obviously, once clear, we'll move quickly to implement those things, although we will require some time. I mean, just as a reminder, the disclosure enhancements and process changes that we have voluntarily made over the last few years have not had a material impact on our financial performance nor do we believe that this court order will have a material impact on our financial performance going forward. 
 So last up, EV, again, really good progress on that initiative. So in the U.K., we're now in market with what we call our 3-in-1 EV solution for commercial fleet clients. So in this case, it includes a U.K. public EV charging network, at-home charging software and, of course, traditional ICE fueling, all of those integrated into one. And I think we've got about 1,000 of our U.K. commercial fleet clients using the solution, so doing well there. 
 Additionally, we're in the market in Continental Europe with an EV solution really for new customer segments, so beyond commercial fleet. So the new segments would include EV car manufacturers, charge point operators, even EV drivers. And fortunately, we are seeing adoption by all 3 of those customer segments which, for us, is clearly all incremental to our fleet payment business. So look, the goal again is to be a major player in this EV transition. And I do want to report, we are officially out of the blocks.
 Okay. So in closing, again, we finished 2022 pretty well. Again, positive sales and retention trends. That obviously helps the setup for this year. '22 full year financial performance, super good, 21% and 22% top and bottom line, way ahead of the initial guide. Again, we've advanced last year a number of important Beyond ideas that supports the future growth of the company. Our outlook for '23, we think positive, outlooking double-digit revenue expectations, improving operating margins and EBITDA, although our absolute profits for sure will be weighed down by the interest rate spike. 
 We do expect to clear our Russia and FTC overhang here in the first half. At the same time, we're going to continue to stake out our position in the new EV world, again, a big opportunity for us. And lastly, our midterm objectives remain intact. We want to grow cash EPS in the 15% to 20% range once we lap the 2023 interest expense headwinds. 
 So with that, let me turn the call back over to Alissa to provide a bit more detail on the quarter. Alissa? 
Alissa Vickery: Thanks, Ron. First, the financial details. As mentioned, we posted 10% growth in revenue in the quarter driven by 7% organic growth or $57 million, which I'll delve into in a moment. The remaining percentages came from $20 million of macro tailwinds and $4 million from acquisitions made over the past year. Organic revenue growth was negatively affected by the impact of one-off items not expected to repeat from the fourth quarter of 2021, including breakage, backlogged card orders, accounting true-ups in the normal course and acquisition accruals. We expect 2023 organic revenue growth to meet our double-digit targets.
 Corporate payments average revenue growth was 20% driven by continued strong new sales across both direct and cross-border. Specifically, our direct corporate payments business grew 27% and continues to demonstrate very robust growth. Cross-border was up 24%, another very good quarter as new sales remained strong, activity levels were robust across nearly all geographies and we completed the full tech integration of AFEX into our cross-border platforms. Lodging continued to perform well, up 14%. 
 While we've largely lapped the airline COVID recovery benefit, the airline business was still up 38% in the quarter. The suite of services we've bought into this business substantially enlarges the TAM and durability of our lodging growth profile over the medium term. Fuel was up organically 2%, with growth in international fuel largely offset by softness in our U.S. micro SMB customer segment. And by micro, we mean companies with less than 5 vehicles, so the smallest of the small. The economic cost of higher fuel prices, inflation and, in the case of micro SMB trucking, lower spot rates, have negatively affected their ability to manage expenses, including their fuel bills, which has resulted in higher bad debt. 
 We have also seen some negative mix shift among that micro trucking segment as higher-margin independent trucking volume is moving to lower-margin volume as those drivers move to the larger contract carriers. This micro segment generated more than 75% of our U.S. fuel bad debt losses in both the fourth quarter and full year 2022, fully feeling the brunt of these economic headwinds. Given the higher loss rates of the micro client segment that we are experiencing, we have significantly tightened credit approval standards and have purposefully targeted a narrow way in order to get ahead of any further stress in this micro segment. The result was a drag in organic fuel growth in the quarter. 
 We are taking a balanced approach to new customer demand gen activities, prioritizing customer segments and industries that are healthier to drive fuel growth in 2023, all while limiting our bad debt exposure. We will continue to feel the residual effect of tighter credit and higher losses in that micro segment in the first half of 2023 but would expect to clear this overhang and return to normalized fuel growth rates in the back half of the year. This will likely cause 2023 fuel organic growth to be at the low end of our normal range. 
 Tolls was up 6% compared with last year as the impact of strong new sales was masked by almost $5 million of nonrecurring revenue in the fourth quarter of last year. Toll sales were strong in the current quarter, recovering from softer sales midyear and helping offset some of the prior year onetime benefit impact. We expect tolls to return to its low to mid-teens growth rate in 2023. 
 We've made great progress building out the Beyond Toll network and now have over 5,400 Beyond Toll locations, including 2,200 fueling stations, 2,300 parking lots, 750 drive-throughs and 150 carwashes that accept our tag. As an additional service to our customers, we are a reseller of insurance from other companies to our more than 6 million tag holders in Brazil, for whom we have negotiated preferential pricing. This insurance offering is growing quite fast. We sold more than 58,000 insurance policies in the quarter. We also signed up Santander as a toll distribution partner, which is the fifth largest bank in the country. All in all, we're very bullish on the outlook for our Brazil business.
 Gift organic growth in Q4 was down 11% over prior year Q4 as the card orders that pulled forward in the last 2 quarters and in Q4 prior year did not repeat. Due to the lumpy nature of card orders between quarters, it is best to look at full year gift organic growth, which was 11%, as the newer online card sales programs and that the B2B program have improved the growth of that business. 
 Looking further down the income statement, operating expenses of $514 million represented an increase over prior Q4, primarily due to recent acquisitions, higher bad debt and volume-related increases. We did recognize $5 million in expense associated with reductions to staffing levels and the termination of office space leases as we adjusted our expense base for the current challenging environment. We will continue to manage our expenses with a very close eye on our outlook. Bad debt expense was $41 million or 9 basis points, consistent with the third quarter 2022 level. I've already talked about what we're doing to manage this, but suffice it to say, we're very focused on it.
 Moving below the line, interest expense was $74 million for the quarter, up 168% over the prior Q4 and $165 million for the full year, up 45%. These increases were driven by higher reference rates on our floating rate debt as well as incremental borrowings for share repurchases and acquisitions. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.2% versus 25.6% last year and lower than our guidance. The primary driver was the impact of a pandemic-related tax benefit election in Brazil realized for 2022 in the quarter. 
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with over $1.4 billion in unrestricted cash and approximately $600 million available on our revolver. There was $5.7 billion outstanding on our credit facilities, and we had $1.3 billion borrowed on our securitization facility. As a reminder, earlier in the year, we upsized and extended our credit facility by approximately $500 million and extended the maturity through June 2027 at quite attractive rates. As of December 30, our leverage ratio was 2.8x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement. 
 Our capital allocation was once again balanced in 2022. In the quarter, we repurchased roughly 600,000 shares at an average price of $188 per share. In total, we've repurchased about 6.2 million shares during 2022 for $1.4 billion. Our guidance for share count for 2023 is 5 million shares lower than what we guided to a year ago. In total, we've bought back 11.7 million shares over the last 2 years. We still have over $1.2 billion authorized for future repurchases. In 2022, we spent $217 million on acquisitions and minority investments, excluding Global Reach on January 1, 2023, solidifying our positions in EV, corporate payments and lodging. 
 Now let me share some thoughts on our Q1 outlook and our full year assumptions. Looking ahead, we're expecting Q1 2023 revenue to be between $875 million and $890 million and adjusted net income per share to be between $3.55 and $3.75. This is largely due to revenue seasonality for certain businesses, such as fuel, lodging and tolls tend to have lighter first quarters due to weather and holidays. As such, the first quarter tends to be the lowest in terms of both revenue and profit for our company. 
 We have a bit of a preview for the first few weeks of the year, and we are tracking to the guidance we are providing. Of note, for the full year 2023, we anticipate managing bad debt flat to the 2022 levels, expecting it will be higher in the first half of the year and then improve into the second half. We expect 2023 net interest expense to be between $312 million and $332 million based on the forward curve as of February 1, 2023, which implies reference rates will peak sometime during the third quarter of 2023. 
 As we disclosed in the earnings release and you can see on Slides 21 and 22 of our supplement, we entered into a series of interest rate swap agreement to fixed rates on approximately $1.5 billion of our floating rate debt. These swaps will provide some relief on our 2023 rate and help limit the downside risk from further rising interest rates. The inverted forward rate curve enabled us to reduce 2023 interest expense by locking in lower future rates over a 3-year period. With these new swaps, along with our previous outstanding swaps, we now have fixed interest rates on a total of $2 billion of our variable rate debt for most of 2023. 
 Last week, we also entered into a euro cross-currency swap to benefit from the lower euro interest rates with an implied interest savings of 1.96% on $500 million of notional debt. With these various swaps, we have now managed interest rate and FX risk on $2.5 billion or 47% of our debt, excluding the securitization. We believe these actions will help mitigate the risk associated with continued increasing interest rates in 2023. We estimate these swaps to reduce interest expense by approximately $35 million in 2023. 
 And finally, our tax rate in 2023 is expected to be slightly higher, between 26% and 27%, as the continued benefit from the Brazil tax holiday is more than offset by higher tax rates in the U.K. as the U.K. statutory tax rate increases from 19% to 25% in April of 2023. The rest of our assumptions can be found in our press release and supplement.
 As I complete my prepared remarks, I would like to extend our gratitude to our more than 10,000 employees around the world who helped us deliver such a strong finish to a great year and who will be the driving force to even greater heights throughout '23. Thank you for your interest in our company. 
 And now operator, we'd like to open the line for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Ron, you talked a little bit about these rising delinquencies among the micro SMEs. I'm just curious, was that fairly contained inside of fuel or the fleet business? Or was there any other weakness among the SMEs? And I'm just curious if you think that this might be a leading indicator of more things to come if you go upmarket. I know you guys haven't assumed any additional macro pressures and such. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, it's a good question, Sanjay. Yes is the short answer. The fuel business, and really the U.S. fuel business, because the terms and the way we collect money and bill internationally is fundamentally different, the terms, we pool all the money, et cetera. So yes, the only place that we've seen the micro, and again, we're talking super-duper small, mostly 1- and 2-card accounts and super-duper new on the books, again, a year or 2, that portion of the overall sales is about 75% of the credit losses. So although the credit losses from that group were sizable, the amount of business from that group is not super sizable. 
 So yes, that's the only place we're seeing it. In fact, when we studied the cohorts that are a bit larger or more mature, longer on the books, it's super ratable with the trailing 12 to 24 months. So it's super-duper pocketed for some reason. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: And you don't think it's a leading indicator or anything, like historically? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean, look, you guys' guess is as good as mine. We've been talking about a macro recession for 6 months now. And we study and look everywhere and we just don't see it. We don't see it in volumes. We don't see it in sales. This is the one place where it showed up. And it started, I don't know, call it, maybe 6 months ago. Kind of September, October, we saw the delinquencies start to step up. So my personal view is that these are quasi-consumer businesses. And as the funds ran out and as the savings got depleted, there's just more pressure on these kind of businesses than others, which is [ what's to embody right ]. When we saw that, we said, okay, you guys always ask, hey, grow corporate payments faster. So we giddyap and go and moved sales dollars and implementation dollars away from our tiny fuel business over there until we see how that plays out. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Okay. Great. Just one quick follow-up for Alissa on some of these impacts that happened to the growth rate in the fourth quarter. As I look across the different segments, there's been a lot of variability in the growth rate. I'm just curious, did that affect multiple lines, those items, those one-off items? 
Alissa Vickery: It did. And so we saw a decent amount in our toll business as well as a little bit in our fuel business. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Those 2. 
Alissa Vickery: And I would just add, this is all normal course of business stuff. It just seemed to be a collection. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I do want to point out, Sanjay, it's Ron again, that we view it kind of as more of a bump than a trend. I did try to call out in the opening basically that we're outlooking this quarter, we're sitting in, let's say, back at 9% or 10%. So really, in our minds, it's a comp issue, not a run rate issue. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Bob Napoli with William Blair. 
Robert Napoli: So I mean, Ron, the corporate payments business, very strong. Within that, you talked about AP being strong, maybe a little more color on what the stronger areas were in the quarter. And did you see any deceleration, significant deceleration, in any areas? A lot of watch and focus on the SMB market. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Bob, it's always good to hear you and hear you doing well. So we posted 20% organic for the quarter for the category, and that's probably our number for '23. You haven't asked me yet, but I'd say, inside of our overall 10%, we're outlooking really about 20% now, so more than high teens. So really inside of it, everything did well, except the channel partner thing. We've said it before that some of the partners that have been with us 4 or 5 years moved some volumes out of people to get different rates. So that business has been flat or going backwards, which means the direct businesses are growing probably 25%. And I think the full AP, where we have every modality, is the fastest growing. I think that particular line of business is probably up 40% to 50% in the quarter. And now we've stuck some software on the front end, so even our lead volume is up. 
 So I'd say the whole business is doing well. Again, the cross-border sales were rock. And I'm looking at the page in front of me, they were up 60%, the sales in Q4, obviously just the process of eating another piece of business which deepens us in the geography. And so I'd say, other than the partner thing, it's firing literally on all cylinders. 
Robert Napoli: And then your investments in EV, appreciate the continued forward-looking moves there, if you would. Can you give any more color, and we get this question a lot, I'm sure everybody else does, of the economics? As you have more experience, especially in Europe, I guess, can you give any color on the economics of EV versus gas and your confidence in that? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, another super good question. So the best place for us to look, really kind of the only place to look, for us is the U.K., right? We've got a big, right, commercial fleet business there and they've been out of the blocks pretty early. So we've got, I think, about 1,200 when I looked of active clients that use both our traditional fueling and some amount of EV. I think the average is about 15% penetration of the EV among those accounts.
 What I know for sure is that the enterprise, the bigger accounts, the economics are super favorable to us as they move to EV. The reason is probably pretty obvious, that you get less fees generally from big accounts, right, that didn't negotiate, but they need these new EV things, and so the ability to get fees from enterprise customers. So the report that I looked at, a sample of, I don't know, 10 or 20 accounts, it's up something like 50% our revenues among the enterprise. I'm guessing that, that probably won't be exactly the same story with a super small account. 
 So what we'll agree to do, I told our guys, is come back probably in 90 days and report out, provide some actual data on this question because it's the million-dollar question, right, for the commercial fleet business, as the stuff comes across, are we in a different base in the economics? I'd say early on, it looks like yes, we are, but more to follow. 
Robert Napoli: Are EVs growing rapidly? 
Ronald F. Clarke: No, not really. I mean, again, the new sales are obviously, right, the mix of every 100 new vehicles, the percent EV is growing. But the base, as you know, like in the United States, I think there's, I don't know, 300 million registered vehicles and the new car sales are 18 million a year. So if half of them were EV, it's 9 million on 300 million. So it's super hard, Bob, to move the base is what I'd say, which is, again, the other thing, as you know, is the EV adoption is happening more in consumer and lighter vehicles, right, versus like 18-wheelers, which is the other motivation for us to chase these EV car manufacturers and EV consumers because there's going to be way more of those in the coming years than there are going to be heavy trucks on EV. 
Operator: And our next question will come from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. 
Darrin Peller: Ron, can we go back to the corporate payments segment for a minute again, just because there's obviously been a lot of data points in the industry around SMBs having some challenges and B2B activity having decelerated. You don't seem like you're seeing that as much, so maybe a little color on what you are seeing in the marketplace.
 And then more importantly, just medium to long term, that's obviously an area that we've talked a lot about in terms of convergence of some of the assets to really offer a more holistic solution on the account payables side. And combine that with payments, whether it's invoice pay and some of the other assets you've acquired, how has that been progressing, just maybe a little update there as well. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Darrin, it's a good question. So the good news for us is that our corporate payments business is a middle market business. So our average account there would look like $200 million to $300 million in revenue for the client, so a decent-sized company, a creditworthy kind of company. So I'd say 95% of our corporate payment business is what we all would call a middle market client.
 So the SMB move that we made, whatever, 1.5 years ago, was really trying to be upside, us trying to extend kind of down-market. So given what's going on with some of our friends in SMB, maybe we're lucky, we haven't made as much progress there. So that's the headline. We're seeing nothing. Volumes are up, spend is up. As you can see in the numbers, the revenue, again, if you kick out the partner piece, is compounding at 25%. And we're out looking at the same kind of number on the direct business here in '23.
 On your second question, which is also a super good one is, we've gotten all the stuff now. I feel like making a Thanksgiving dinner is 8 million ingredients to comp again, then all of a sudden, someday, there's a plate and there's 6 items on the plate. We're kind of, I don't want to say done, but close to done. We've got all the stuff. We've got smart cars. We've got front-end AP automation software. We pay every modality. We've got a global international payment capability. We've got networks. So we kind of have the stuff, Darrin, to offer the whole package now to these middle market clients. And we're getting more and more of the clients to buy both our smart card and our AP stuff because we're in the CFO office. And as you know, we moved the branding, so it makes more sense now. One company is coming in with a full line. 
 So I would say that it's the marketing challenge in front of us. We've got the stuff to have an integrated pack. And now between the brand and educating sales guys in the market, I think we're going to sell way more of the package stuff as we move forward here. 
Darrin Peller: Okay. Okay. Timing-wise, Ron. I actually do have a quick follow-up for Alissa, if that's okay, on the revenue growth rate. Maybe I'll just throw it in now, which is, when we look at the cadence on revenue growth trends, I know there's some seasonality to it. But again, you're coming off of the 7% rate. Obviously, there were those onetime items that you called out last year's quarter. Just to make sure, do you see any other kind of impediments to that growth rate this year beyond macro in terms of onetime items that we have to grow over or anything else? Or do you see that being pretty clean from a macro adjusted basis? 
Alissa Vickery: Yes. I mean, I would expect that short of the macro adjustments we make always for organic revenue growth, which neutralizes those items, that we wouldn't expect anything meaningful other than as we perhaps called out in the same quarter prior year, so I would encourage you to look back at those notes. But I mean, I think other than as we've spoken to the micro SMB customer segment in our fuel business, I think that's going to be the only item to speak of. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Darrin, it's Ron again, the guide is 10% and 12%, right? We're guiding kind of 10% organic at the midpoint and add a couple of points for the role of the acquisitions of the print at 12%. That's what we're sitting here telling you. That's what we're chasing. That's the number. 
Alissa Vickery: Yes. 
Operator: And our next question will come from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: I wanted to ask on the margin outlook. I think you mentioned up 150 bps, Ron. So I think 90 days ago, you previewed 200 to 300 bps, so I'm curious what's changed in the last 90 days. Is it more about investing or changes in thinking around costs, things like that, or mix? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Good question, Tien-Tsin. So yes, the plan that we landed is, I guess, 150 full year and Q4, 200. And the short answer is I just decided to spend more money on the acquired businesses. So if you look at our core OpEx, so kick out all the '22 acquisitions we did, it's below 5%. I think it's only 3% or 4%. But the pile of acquisitions, we're spending another, I don't know, $70 million or $80 million incremental year-over-year. And so a bunch of those are dilutive things. They're EV things. They're onetime things to integrate like the Global Reach, their sales investments and stuff. 
 And so that was the call. The call was really to make sure that we gave enough oxygen to these sets of new assets that we just got so that we can get a return on them. And since we could kind of make all the numbers work, we start with the design, we start with what's the goal and then work our way around it. So I felt like we kind of made the number we want, kind of 10% to 12% on the top, sales in the high teens across the kind of where we guided to, EBITDA growth of 15%, so growing obviously operating earnings faster. So it kind of fit into the envelope, so we made the call to do it. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Got you. No, I trust that's the right investment to make. Then just as my quick follow-up then on your appetite to do deals. I know I always ask you this, Ron, but just from a deals perspective, how does the pipeline look? I know you have a lot going on. You're spending more on acquired assets, including in EVs. Is there more to do in the short run? Or could we see a little bit of a pause from a deal-making standpoint? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. You certainly know us well, Tien-Tsin. We never will run out a pipeline. So yes, we had deals. I'd say it's kind of, in my mind, a little bit of good and bad on the deal front. I think the good is I really am seeing some reset on the valuation side, right? Prices have been down longer. I think people that were waiting have waited longer, they're not seeing the bids. People aren't hitting the bids they're looking for, the apps they're looking for. The bad is obviously the cost of capital. So it raises your confidence in your thesis, right, to pull the trigger, to make sure we're generating the right kind of returns. So I'd say there's a little bit of tension between those. So a better maybe valuation outlook but a bit higher cost of capital. 
 But look, we've always, as you know, not been a financial buyer of things where we just buy it and absorb it. We've always had some view of how to double-profit. So again, we have things in the pipeline that we like that we think we can make returns on. And if we can, we will. We'll full-throttle on it. 
 I'd say we're probably, back to capital allocation, less excited about buybacks. Sitting here again, given the cost of capital, the incretion at least short term, maybe longer term, is okay. But short term isn't quite as attractive. And delevering, frankly, is a bit crazy, more attractive, given the spreads are wider, right, between deposit rates and borrowing rates. So I'd say that the kind of some of these changes is affecting a bit how we're thinking about, was it $1.3 billion, Alissa? $1.3 billion is the plan, Tien-Tsin. So I'd say my first and foremost is all these deals that we can make returns on. 
Operator: And our next question will come from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. 
Ramsey El-Assal: I wanted to follow up on your response to Darrin's question earlier about having all the ingredients in place within corporate payments to kind of realize that sort of power. My question is actually broader across the entire enterprise and maybe all of the segments, within the segments. Are you now kind of organizationally, technologically well positioned for cross-selling? Or are there still initiatives and capabilities and linkages that need to be made in order to kind of unlock the synergy potential in the broader enterprise? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Ramsey, it's Ron. It's a super, super good question. I'd say we're out ahead on the synergy and relatedness in corporate payments, and the primary reason is it's a middle market business. So whenever you go to a client that's got $200 million to $300 million in revenue, it has more needs, right? It does more things. Obviously, it's got a lot of AP, right? If it's got $200 million to $300 million in revenue, it's obviously got a lot of employees probably running around in vehicles. And so you'll see us selling fleet cards, for example, to our corporate payment clients. And fuel runs 10% to 12% of all the spend volume among our middle market corporate payment clients, which I guess wouldn't be shocking. So in that area, I would say, for sure, there will be a broad package of services that will all be sold into the same client.
 As you move into the SMB thing, I think we're going to move organizationally towards a more integrated model like you're saying because the tech, I think, frankly, is ahead of our org. And so we're looking at starting to consolidate the vehicle-related purchases. So if you're sitting in a car and you buy fuel or you recharge on EV or you pay for a toll, when you go into a parking spot, whatever, all of those, even 92% of our lodging clients drive a company vehicle, the tree-cutting truck to the actual hotel.
 So we're in the business mostly of vehicles, company vehicles, running around and us helping make the payments. And so it's a way more super-related thing than what we've talked about before as though they're discrete things. And so you'll see us start to move organizationally more to looking at that set of solutions as vehicle-related payments and then the corporate payments, again, as a thing for the middle market. 
Ramsey El-Assal: That was super helpful. It makes a ton of sense. A quick follow-up from me, I think on the 2023 guidance, you were able to call out in the course of the call a segment specific expectation for corporate payments. And I think Alissa something for tolls and fuel. Would you mind rounding that out and just giving us your expectations for lodging and, if applicable, guests for the year, so just for sort of modeling purposes? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Sure. So again, at the midpoint, it'd be 10% overall. So fleet, kind of mid-single but weaker first half, stronger second half. Lodging in Brazil, mid-teens, maybe a smidge below 15%, a smidge above. And corporate payments, even with the channel in it, I'm going to give a number probably 20%, maybe north of 20%, and obviously, way north of 20% if you kick out the channel. So that's the mix that rounds to 10%. 
 And again, you guys have heard this before, we're super thoughtful on the design. When we saw the super micro segment weaken, we just literally reallocated. We just said, okay, I want, in terms of marketing and sales investment, more into the middle market. Darrin brought up earlier that certainly not as many macro kind of risk and basically just kind of tread water a little bit until we see more about how this micro and SMB segment plays out this year. So we're kind of derisking the plan a bit, I tell you. 
Operator: And our next question will come from Sheriq Sumar with Evercore ISI. 
Sheriq Sumar: I have a question on the 2023 outlook and especially on the share count. It's say 75 million for the full year. Does that assume any sort of buybacks throughout the year or it does not? And if it does not, then would there be more upside to the EPS, assuming that you accelerate the buyback throughout the year? 
Alissa Vickery: Sheriq, it's Alissa. It's a good question. On share count, I'll first say, in our guidance, we never include the impact of potential buybacks because we see it similar to our capital allocation decisions, like acquisition or divestiture. We're going to hold those decisions until they make sense. And so we do not build that into guidance. And then I guess, in terms of the share count as we run in, the number you see that we presented in our assumptions is consistent with what we expect for the rest of the year. 
Ronald F. Clarke: And what we printed for Q3 and Q4, correct? 
Alissa Vickery: And fairly aligned with where you saw us come out of Q3 and what you can now see in the Q4 number. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Sheriq, it's Ron. Our default is always just delevering, right? We plan to generate $1.3 billion of free cash flow in our models, assuming that we just reduce debt as we run through the year. And then to the extent that we take money to do a buyback in Q2, we'll update the guidance to reflect that different use of capital. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Jeff Cantwell with Wells Fargo. 
Jeffrey Cantwell: Congrats on the results. Ron, just as a follow-up on Darrin's question earlier. In your prepared remarks, you said that in 2022, you added an AP automation software front end to your whole AP execution business. And we all know what that is, what you've been doing there. So my question is, what does that mean that your execution there on the front end going forward would impact others that you've been partnering with over the years in any way? Does that mean that you're trying to capture those volumes on the front end? Can you just help us understand the strategy there and how to think about that going forward? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Jeff, I'm not positive I'm picking up the question. Can you just rephrase it for me? 
Jeffrey Cantwell: Yes. So we've been watching what you did with Roger and Corpay. And we know that you have Comdata as well. So we're trying to figure out if there's some competitive angle to what you're doing on the front end as you start to bring that into the picture with how you're going to market with SMBs. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay. Yes, there's clearly a competitive angle. I think historically, stand-alone AP automation software companies sold AP automation software. Knock-knock, "I've got software that simplifies your processes, automates approvals, digitizes stuff, so you don't lose it. Hey, that's what we do." And then knock-knock, a bank said, "Hi, I can help you actually execute electronic payments for you or cross-border payments."
 And so the idea we've been at a long time is, well, let's do both, which we've connected them already, obviously. So hey, knock-knock, "We can help you make the process work better in your company and save you time and reduce risk, and we will pay all the different ways. Every modality, we'll execute at all. You don't need to call your bank or FX specialist or your printing company to print out paper checks. We'll do the whole thing." So we think that it's a huge advantage to have that package to provide more value to clients. 
 It seemingly, early on, generates more leads because historically, people have been interested in both sides of that thing. We're not the biggest. We've got to be one of the biggest nonbank full AP payers already. So I think it is a pretty big advantage for us going forward. 
Jeffrey Cantwell: Got it. Okay. Great. And just wanted to follow up just on Bob's question earlier on EV. And I guess the question is, just to frame it for you, you're a $16 billion market cap company and you're generating over $3.8 billion in annual revenue this coming year. So can you just remind us, can you size that revenue opportunity for us maybe, call it, 2, 3, 5 years out? We'll all just trying to figure out this substitution effect and incremental revenue impacts, et cetera, et cetera. So how would you frame that as we think about our models? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. That's another super good question. So first off, it's obviously a long time out. So the first thing I'd say is, on the defensive side, so on the commercial fleet side, the opportunity is the size of our whole business, right? If you went 40 years into the future and we've got, what, a $1.5 billion revenue global fleet business, the hope is, if we replace the business 50 years to today, everything was EV, we'd have a $1.5 billion business plus however we'd grow between now and then.
 But for us, I think the bigger opportunity that's nearer in is this consumer lighter vehicle thing that we're going to get to through the EV carmakers and through the new gas station operators that are called charge point operators. So the big part of our strategy that we're spending money on is going offensive and chasing 2 new segments that aren't any part of our business today that we think are going to show up sooner because the vehicles work better, right, the light vehicles. I mean, again, it's just a function of adoption. That's massive obviously, right? It's every vehicle that's not a commercial fleet, you're into there in terms of the TAM. So it's a massive, massive business. 
 And I think I said repeatedly, our strategy in the thing is to be the network guy. Our company is built on proprietary networks that have unique data that we pick up and then the volume that we have that creates better economics. And our idea is the same, we're going to put together EV acceptance networks where we collect data that's interesting to clients, like what kind of chargers are there, is the charger open now if I drive there. And we think that providing that in some simple way is going to be super interesting. And we've got 5 or 10 already big EV carmakers using our software and our network to try to reduce charge anxiety, right, of new buyers. So it's massive. The question is just when, how long, right, before either side, either the commercial side or the consumer side, gets big. 
Jeffrey Cantwell: Okay. Great. That's super helpful. Congrats again. 
 [Technical Difficulty] 
Peter Christiansen: Hello? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Pete, we can hear you. 
Peter Christiansen: Sorry about that. I didn't hear the intro. Just wanted to dig into the fuel card business a little bit. Given some of the pockets of weakness that you called out on the credit side, Ron, are you going to sell any differently in '23? How are you augmenting your sales strategy there? And then as a follow-up on the partner side of the fuel card business, just wondering if you could shed any color on like RFP activity or if there's any major contract renewals coming up. Any help would be great there. 
Ronald F. Clarke: You got it, pal. So on the first part of the question, hey, what are we doing for selling in 2023, the answer is yes, there'll be some different things. So the first thing we've done, which we're about 90 days into, is we're repointing our digital machine and algorithm to larger accounts. So the guy that runs our digital sales business tweaked the models effectively to point at what I would call larger and more creditworthy accounts. So you'll see that. For sure, our sales size of new accounts will go up starting here in Q1 versus Q4. So that's point 1. We'll modify the targeting of our digital engine. 
 And then number two is I've moved dollars. We've reallocated dollars to the corporate payments business. So I just said, okay, I'm not going to grow sales investment or sales as much in a space that has potentially more macro risk. We're going to earmark at least here in 2023 into the middle market that we have. There's more stability, if you will, in the macro. So those are really the 2 things we're doing selling-wise. 
 And again, it's pretty small, it's a pile of bad debt, this micro super-duper new thing, but it's not big per se, right, against the total business, right, the total revenue. So that's that point. On the second one, there's not much. I'd say it's pretty quiet. Also, the other people that play the game have a lot of long-term contracts, both here and in Europe, so there's really nothing on the radar, I'd say, significant that we're looking at in 2023. 
Operator: And our next question will come from Nik Cremo with Credit Suisse. 
Nikolai Cremo: I just wanted to touch back on the fuel segment first. How did the same-store sales come in across the various parts of that business in the quarter? And just looking to 2023, what parts of the fuel business gives you confidence that the segment can reaccelerate in the back half given the deceleration we've seen in the last few quarters? 
Alissa Vickery: Yes. So Nik, it's Alissa. It's a good question. To make sure I got all your question, I think you're asking what is kind of same-store sales look and how are we outlooking? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. How would you get to the reacceleration? 
Alissa Vickery: Oh, reacceleration. So yes, so for same-store sales, I would say we always say that same-store sales sort of a massive easy comp is usually in the minus 1% to plus 1% range. And I would say that we did see it soften just a little bit more than that in the fourth quarter to minus 2%. But as we look into reacceleration, it really is just retweaking the engine as we head into '23, repointing that digital engine to higher credit quality customers and then just refocusing the entire sales engine across the board to target those, I'll just call it, healthier customer bases in segments. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Let me make sure, Nik, you're clear that we pull this trigger. Like, we're super conscious that the health of these super-duper small accounts was deteriorating. So we said, okay, let's stop selling to them, so stop, and then repoint to the bank. And then second, because their delinquency was up, it creates more involuntary attrition, so a great volume softness, too. So basically, both of those things happen, right? We're not going to keep this picket open. We're tightening terms if you look shaky. And so we did it to make sure that a small, little, tiny part of our business didn't turn into a bigger problem. So we went right with our eyes wide open doing this thing. 
 And so the answer is we've been, for 90 days, repointing the thing to bigger fuel accounts and then moving money to the mid-market. So we're happy. There's nothing wrong. We're not worried about the thing. Again, our plan is to have more in the second half. I think if it's 5%, it will be [ 2% and 7% ] or something, right, first half, second half. But I want you to hear it, we made the decisions to do both of these things for cautionary reasons and not get run over later. 
Operator: And our next question will come from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. 
Julian Broche: This is Julian on for Andrew. So I have a quick modeling one and then kind of more general one. So is the lodging business, like normalized growth rate, how do we think about that, like high teens to 20%? Is that the right way to think about that? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, 15% to 20%. 
Julian Broche: 15% to 20%. Okay. Got it. And then I know you said that you're off the block on EV. Obviously, airline did really well this quarter, 38% up. I know that you had an in-house prior option. Any updates there? Like, is that something in the pipeline in terms of deals that you're seeing? Like, are you looking to expand there? Kind of elaborate on that a little bit. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. So really, a couple of comments, I think, on the airline growth. So one of it is just continued recovery, right? Airline was super down so I think there's still some "long-tail" COVID recovery and still, sitting here today, we still don't have Asia back. There's still more to come as the Asia volume picks back up. But I think the new things that we've done there, we bought a company a year ago, that's really working. 
 Like I mentioned, we won a couple of accounts that we had when we put this app in to speed, de-stress people, right, to their hotels instead of queuing up at the line. Well, now we've added, sold the first contract, which you'll see in the forward numbers, basically rebooking simultaneously with the lodging. So your plane gets canceled here in Atlanta tonight. First, you got to find a place to sleep and then you got to figure out how to go. Well, let's say you're on Air Canada and it doesn't have any flights or any flights available, our tech basically looks and books you on other airlines. 
 Literally, as you're walking off the plane, you're getting a hotel and getting rebooked. So the customer sat that the airlines are getting from having less unhappy people when they get off a plane, I think this is going to become table stakes. So if a couple of airlines sees a couple that are picking this thing from us early, that this thing, we could literally run the table on this. So this is an example of bringing kind of some tech to kind of an old-fashioned problem, and it's working. 
Julian Broche: Got it. And then if I could sneak one more in, could you talk maybe a little bit about your digital marketing, how that's coming along, maybe any recent examples of success there? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean, other than the micro thing, I think the answer is it's representing, obviously, in every business, a larger and larger piece. For example, lodging which we just talked about, I think it's up now about 15% of the sales in that line of business. It was probably 5% 2 or 3 years ago. It's taking a way bigger chunk of the marketing leads. We used to do old-fashioned trade shows for middle markets and things like that. So I'd say that not only are digital sales that we close on compounding a good rate, but I think the lead sources from digital are also way up. Again, a lot of this is the world, right? We're just chasing along with the world, making sure that we're in the right places. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Trevor Williams with Jefferies. 
Trevor Williams: I guess with Global Reach now closed, just wanted to see if you could give us an update on the revenue mix within corporate payments, between FX, cross-border, virtual card, full AP. And then within the 20% growth outlook for the year, just any sense for which of those buckets you expect to be the primary contributors. I know this is a really good FX year with elevated currency vol, so just kind of how you're thinking of the moving pieces within the segment for '23. 
James Eglseder: Yes, Trevor, this is Jim. I mean, the best way to think about it is that cross-border is probably going to be closer to 65%, and call it, 25% direct and then 10% channel. 
Ronald F. Clarke: 60%? 60-40? 
James Eglseder: Yes. So all-in cross-border, 60%. Domestic corporate payments, 40%. So they're going to move around a little bit. 
Ronald F. Clarke: I mean, your question is a good one, Trevor, in terms of the growth thing, having markets that are pacing, interest rate moves differently, right? Like, Brazil got out super early. And then I guess we, the U.S., got out. And now Europe is chasing. So having different timing and differential in the rates obviously creates FX volatility. So that obviously is helpful running here into the beginning of '23.
 But all of these is worthy, right? To get to an aggregate number, we're giving you, hey, look, we're looking, a year from today, 20% revenue growth organic plus, obviously, the print would be way higher because we're adding this deal. Clearly, most everything, Trevor, has to be working. I'm telling you that the channel, which is a pretty small piece, less than 10% probably, is going backwards. So everything else has got to be somewhere in the low to mid-20s to get the entire thing to be 20%. So I don't want to sound too cocky on it, but it's like all working. We're just selling a lot. Retention is super great in those sets of businesses. Obviously, spend is growing in the middle market, right, as smaller companies fall, so obviously bigger companies, particularly like in trucking and other areas, are picking it up. 
 So I think the message to you guys is, our product line is better and more complete, I just think that this business has kind of really coming into its own now for us. And it's big finally, right? It's going to surpass $1 billion. And I don't know what it was, but not a $1 billion a few years ago. So it's become a sizable thing now for the company. 
Trevor Williams: Yes. That's great. And just one more on corporate pay, Corpay One, any update you can give us there? I think last year, you were talking about taking more of a measured approach with some of the migrations. But just any update on progress there or just overall strategic thinking on your plan for it over the next couple of years and the cross-sell opportunity? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. So that one is really still a work in process because the core business is middle market. I'd say this is an acorn, but it's a pretty small part. And so when we took a swing and miss at the cross-sell, I did, we did, not a super smart thing. We've really said, okay, how do we get the product to be right for the scene and how do we get the distribution to be right for the scene. So what we've concluded is we are not going to chase super-duper small accounts that don't have much AP that are at the very bottom. 
 And so we're really kind of retooling the product and distribution to be upmarket a bit, so still below middle market but kind of off of the floor. And particularly, given what we're seeing and hearing in the marketplace, that seems like the right call to have not rushed into like super micro kind of AP accounts. So we'll report more. [ I'd say it doesn't matter how ] it is a priority since we did the swing and the miss on the cross-sell, but we are continuing to work it. 
Operator: And we've reached the allotted time for questions today, so we'd like to thank you for attending today's presentation. This will conclude the question-and-answer session. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-11-02 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]  Please note this event is being recorded. I'd like to turn the conference to Jim Eglseder, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
James Eglseder: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. With me today are Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO; and Alissa Vickery, our Interim CFO. Following  the prepared comments, the operator will announce that the queue will open for the Q&A session. It is only then that you can get in line for questions.
 Please note, our earnings release and supplement can be found under the Investor Relations section of our website at fleetcor.com. Now throughout this call, we will be covering organic revenue growth. As a reminder, this metric neutralizes the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and fuel spreads.
 It also includes pro forma results for acquisitions closed during the 2 years being compared. We will also be covering non-GAAP financial metrics, including revenues, net income and net income per diluted share, all on an adjusted basis. These measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than that at other companies. Reconciliations of the historical non-GAAP to the most directly comparable GAAP information can be found in today's press release and on our website.
 I also need to remind everybody that part of our discussion today may include forward-looking statements. These statements reflect the best information we have of today. All statements about our outlook, new products and expectations regarding business development and future acquisitions are based on that information. They are not guarantees of future performance, and you should not put undue reliance upon them.
 We undertake no obligation to update any of these statements. These expected results are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K and in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available on our website and at sec.gov. Now with that out of the way, I will turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Jim, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q3 2022 earnings call. Upfront here, I'll plan to cover 4 subjects. First, I'll provide my take on Q3 results. Second, I'll provide updated full year 2022 guidance. Third, provide just a brief preview of 2023, along with some of the factors that will affect our performance.
 And then lastly, I'll catch you up on a few recent developments. Okay. Let me turn to our Q3 results, which were quite good and ahead of our expectations. We reported revenue of $893 million, that's up 18%,  and cash EPS of $4.24, that's up 21%. Our EBITDA for the quarter exceeded $450 million. Organic revenue growth, quite good, coming in at 13%. That was led by our corporate payments business at 21% and our lodging business at 28%.
 Trends in the quarter quite are good also. Same-store sales finished plus 2%, retention remaining steady at 92%. And overall sales performance, just terrific, up 24% for the quarter. We onboarded almost 60,000 new clients during Q3. So the fundamentals of the business remain very solid, obviously, selling a lot and retaining a lot.
 Look, additionally, I want to point out that we're continuing to strengthen the setup, the positioning of the company, which obviously improves our growth prospects going forward, added some important EV assets and further refined our plan to go on offense. We added some pretty important AP automation software to front end our corporate payments solution set that really rounds out for us that AP solution set. And we continue to expand our fuel footprint in Brazil, driving transaction growth there.
 I think we're expecting an exit rate of about $10 million annual add-on fueling transaction. So good progress. Okay. Let me shift gears and turn to our updated full year 2022 guidance along with the assumptions behind it. So we're revising full year 2022 revenue guidance up to $3.410 billion at the midpoint. This includes absorbing about $8 million of macro headwind in the second half versus our August guide. 
 We're maintaining full year 2022 cash EPS guidance of $15.95 at the midpoint, same number we gave in August. This does include a bit of a flip-flop. We pulled some revenue forward through gift orders into Q3 that we had outlooked in Q4. We're also absorbing about $0.04 to $0.05 of dilution from the new Plugsurfing and Accrualify acquisitions. We're also incurring about $30 million of incremental bad debt and interest expense way above our August guide as the Fed has accelerated their interest rate increases.
 So if we achieve this $3.410 billion and $15.95 updated '22 guidance, that would represent 20% revenue growth and 21% earnings growth for the full year versus 2021. Okay. Importantly, next up, I'm going to share a brief preview of our early look into 2023. So like most companies, we're expecting the '23 setup to be quite challenging. We do run the business, plan the business on a macro neutral basis, really so that we can operate through any kind of cycle, good or bad. Then we do overlay our spending and capital allocation decisions based on the environment we're seeing.
 So for '23, we're expecting organic revenue growth overall of about 10% which is our target. That's based on our preliminary '23 budget submissions. Inside of that, probably no surprise, global fleet outlooking mid- to high single digits. Our lodging and Brazil businesses mid-teens and our corporate payment business for next year, high teens. And by the way, closing in on almost $1 billion of overall revenue next year, so getting quite significant.
 We'll bake in clearly less OpEx expense growth next year with a goal of delivering 200 to 300 basis points of margin improvement. We're hopeful we can reach a '23 cash EPS with a [ $17 ] handle but that's ultimately going to turn on; one, the level of sales investment we make and then the corresponding bad debt that comes with that. Two, interest rates where they peak and if and when they start down. Three, FX rates, a particular eye on the pound, does it recover? 
 And then lastly, recession, do we get one. And if we do, what would the depth and duration be? So look, on the recession front, in particular, we wouldn't describe FLEETCOR's recession proof but pretty recession resilient. Some of the reasons that we should be pretty recession resilient are: first, our solutions are essential, generally not discretionary. Demand for our services runs higher in inflationary or cost conscious times, think fuel this year and the demand that we see.
 And lastly, our businesses are really diverse geographically, by client size from SMB to enterprise, lots of verticals we serve, obviously, lots of product or spending categories. We're by no means immune to some client segments, certain client segments being impacted by recession, for example, construction. And for sure, we'll reel in restrict credit in the event of a downturn and that, for sure, pressures revenue.
 So look, we plan to have a much clearer picture of 2023 when we speak again in 90 days, and we'll offer up our formal '23 guidance then? Okay. Let me transition to my last subject, which is to catch you up on a few recent developments. And let me begin with the FTC case. So the court held a 2-day hearing on the FTC matter that was on October 20 and 21. Importantly, the judge concluded that she would not enter the proposed FTC order and rather encouraged the parties to mediate to negotiate, so that we've agreed to engage with the FTC and see what we can work out. We do think that the face-to-face court hearing was really quite helpful.
 It gave us a chance to summarize the various disclosure and process enhancements that we have voluntarily made really over the last 4 or 5 years, all of them aimed at enhancing our customer experience. So some of the enhancements we called out were eliminating certain digital add claims and the language around that. We ceased selling add-on features via negative option and instead packaged up various features in the 3 packages and sell those affirmatively upfront.
 We designed and implemented much bigger, bolder Ts and Cs, including a [indiscernible] like fee box that's front and center. And lastly, we collected express or what we call affirmative consent from 96% of our fuel card client base to the specific terms of their card program. We've also proposed some new incremental enhancements going forward. That would include crediting client payments on the day we receive them versus the day they're posted along with some other items that comply with the CFPB consumer payment standards. Obviously, we're B2B, but are willing to do this.
 We've talked about combining our invoicing and reporting materials into a single consolidated package to make it easier for clients to review. And we said repeatedly, I think, throughout this FTC case that we're trying to cooperate trying to be transparent. We simply emphasize to the court that we need to know exactly what the practices are that we're being asked to implement. And if we can understand them, we'll implement, we'll comply with them.
 We're also saying again today that we don't believe that the disclosure enhancements that we've already made which we can see nor the additional ones that we're contemplating will have a material impact on the company's go-forward financial performance.
 Okay. Let me turn to our situation in Russia. We've made the decision to explore selling the Russia business. We've retained a local investment bank. We have formally launched the sales process, it is underway. The business does generate meaningful free cash flow. So that can potentially support acquisition financing, along with annual dividends. And we think that, that should provide a reasonable floor on the valuation.
 Additionally, we completed all of the isolation or separation steps necessary to carve the business away from FLEETCOR. This provides assurance that we can maintain compliance with the sanctions. And we do plan to move into this isolation or passive ownership phase beginning in early December. And obviously, we will keep you updated on the sale process.
 So lastly, on the acquisition and capital allocation front, we did complete 3 capability acquisitions since we spoke last. So corporate payments add-on called Accrualify on August 1; an important EV deal in Europe, Plugsurfing on September 1, and we closed literally yesterday an international workforce lodging deal called Roomex. And finally, we expect to complete the cross-border deal called Global Reach, which is a bolt-on around the end of the year. So as you can see, we focused really on capability acquisitions in this environment, choosing to strengthen, again, the positioning and setup of the company over the midterm.
 We do hope that M&A valuations reset a bit next year, higher interest rates will obviously take hold. And just maybe we can get back to larger accretive transactions. Additionally, we did repurchase $500 million of FLT in Q3 at what we think are quite attractive prices. So look, in closing today, again, very good Q3 results. Earnings grew 21%, maintaining our full year '22 cash EPS guidance at $15.95 despite a bit weakening macro that we're absorbing. This would represent a $0.70 higher number than the initial EPS guidance that we provided in February.
 We do expect '23 to be a challenging year, but see our overall organic growth rate in and around 10% our target. And again, our earnings turning mostly on the interest rate and FX environment. The FTC case, finally winding down. Again, we do not expect a material impact going forward. We have decided to explore the sale of our Russia business, again, underway and delighted with these handful of capability acquisitions this quarter.
 Lastly, many thanks to Alissa here for stepping in to the CFO role on an interim basis. So now over to you, Alissa. 
Alissa Vickery: Thanks, Ron. I'm happy to be here on my first earnings call as CFO, albeit on an interim basis. I look forward to meeting many of you on the conference circuit in the fourth quarter. But now let's look at some more detail on the quarter. As Ron mentioned, we posted 18% growth in revenue, driven by 13% organic growth or $96 million, which I'll delve into in a moment.
 The remaining growth was 4% or $27 million from macro tailwinds and 2% or $14 million from acquisitions made over the past year. Impacting our results were fuel prices of $4.46 per gallon for the quarter, higher than prior year of $3.15 which contributed $26 million of additional revenues versus prior year and lower than our $4.64 guidance assumption from August. Fuel spread revenue was also quite positive by about $21 million compared to the prior year as falling fuel prices during the quarter caused spreads to widen. Offsetting these tailwinds was a $21 million negative impact of lower foreign exchange rates primarily resulting from unfavorable movement in the British pound. 
 Now moving to organic growth. Corporate payments was up 21%, driven by continuing strong new sales across both direct and cross-border. Specifically, our direct corporate payments business, or nonpartner business grew 24% and continues to demonstrate very robust growth, especially for AP, which grew 44%. Cross-border was up 30%, another very good quarter as new sales remained strong and activity levels were again robust across nearly all geographies.
 Our channel partner business is just under 10% of the corporate payments category and declined 13% in the quarter as our focus is on growing our direct businesses. Fuel grew organically 5% as we did see some volume softness in our U.S. SMB businesses. However, our new sales growth was 13%, and we continue to see a normalized level of flat, same-store sales contributing to the performance. Overall transaction volumes remain positive and consistent with last quarter, although we continue to see slight moderation in new sales activity.
 Tolls was up 12% organically compared with last year as the business continues to perform. New sales are solid, driven by our expanded product utility and differentiated value proposition. As a reminder, our toll solution can be used to pay for multiple spend categories, such as parking and drive through retail, and we are now generating meaningful revenue from our Beyond Toll use cases.
 Lodging continued to show strength in Q3, up 28%. All 3 business lines: Workforce, Airlines and Insurance each had double-digit organic growth. With Airlines, again, leading the way at 55%. Growth was driven by a combination of higher year-over-year volume in Workforce and Airlines and a favorable rate environment across all 3 businesses. Gift had another good quarter, up 9% as customer card orders continue to be pulled forward from Q4.
 We estimate that approximately $6 million of revenue was pulled into Q3 due to early ordering in advance of the holiday season. In addition to the $10 million to $12 million we estimated was pulled forward into the second quarter. Looking further down the income statement, operating expenses of $504 million represented a 21% increase over $417 million in Q3 of the prior year due to increases tied to higher volumes across our businesses, incremental bad debt, stock compensation and new sales generation activities.
 Increases were also driven by the inclusion of the ALE and Plugsurfing acquisitions in addition to higher incentives and commissions as a result of strong new sales in certain of our businesses. Bad debt expense was $37 million or 8 basis points which was about $10 million higher than last quarter and more in line with prepandemic bad debt levels. In the third quarter of 2021, bad debt was $11 million or  3 basis points. This increase was driven primarily by higher loss severity as a result of higher fuel prices in the second quarter as well as increases in application volume and application fraud.
 Bad debt levels remain elevated as a result of strong sales to new customers who tend to have a higher loss rate than the existing book, higher fuel prices and the changing macroeconomic landscape, which puts pressure on our smaller customers. Interest expense increased 56% year-over-year, driven by higher rates on our floating rate debt with average LIBOR or SOFR in the current quarter of 2.2% compared to 0.09% in the same period prior year.
 As Ron noted, we'll provide guidance for 2023 in February when we report our full year earnings. I did want to make one comment on how to think about net interest expense all in for 2023. We currently estimate that our 2023 net interest expense is likely to be closer to double the 2022 level. This assumes that benchmark index rates peak next year between 4.5% and 5% and remain in that range for most of the year.
 While all of our debt instruments are floating rate, we do have $500 million of hedges that will be in place for almost all of 2023 at 2.56%. Also, we have over $1 billion in cash balances globally on which we earn interest. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.8% versus 24.1% last year, which is more of a normalized tax rate for the business.
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with over $1.3 billion in unrestricted cash and approximately $600 million available on our revolver. There was $5.7 billion outstanding on our credit facilities, and we had $1.5 billion borrowed in our securitization facility. As of September 30, our leverage ratio was 2.95x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement. 
 In the quarter, we upsized and extended our securitization facility by $100 million to $1.7 billion and extended the maturity by 1 year to August 2025. There were a number of minor changes to the agreement, which will be detailed in our 10-Q next week. We repurchased roughly 2.2 million shares at an average price of [ $2.24 ] per share for a total of $500 million during Q3. This includes the roughly 900,000 shares repurchased before our earnings call in August. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 5.6 million shares for $1.3 billion. The Board approved another $1 billion in repurchases under our program on October 25 and extended the program through February 2024.
 With this upsizing, we now have approximately $1.355 billion  available for future repurchases. As Ron has covered our full year guidance update, let me now share some thoughts on our guidance assumptions. We are assuming fuel prices of $4.25 in Q4. Market spreads favorable to the fourth quarter of 2021, total interest expense of $157 million to $167 million for 2022, which assumes average reference rates of 3.75% in Q4. The rest of our assumptions can be found in our press release and supplement. Thank you for your interest. And now operator, we'd like to open the line for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. 
Darrin Peller: Even looking on like a 2-year basis, the Fleet segment looks like it's high single digits or about 9%, 10% growth when just stacking it. It definitely looks like it's trending back to a normal rate or even better than a normal rate versus what I think you guys would have expected. So can you touch on that for a minute in terms of where we are in your view versus any type of recovery. And then obviously, again, going into a more uncertain macro environment, they're resilient to that business because it does look like it's gotten to a point where it's doing the right thing from a growth rate standpoint.
 And then just quickly, the add-ons, the follow-ons and the cross-sells that you've been really able to implement, how has that been going, Ron? And if you could just touch on that too. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Darrin, thanks. So on the first one, I think we're still kind of in the 5% to 8% kind of target range based on what we elect to invest. Some of the overperformance recently is literally the COVID recovery kind of [ climb ] back from the [ debts ] there in 2020. So I think we're probably mostly unchanged because we've got a lot of the businesses to feed and investments to make that we're kind of happy in that mid- to high single digits. So that's our target.
 On the add-ons, I'd still say still early days. We're still struggling with where in the base, right? We've got a couple of hundred thousand clients we should target. So I think I mentioned initially we were thinking, hey, we'll go to where the bulk is down market and then realize most of the spend is in the larger accounts there, which we get after different distribution.
 So I'd say we're still testing some different ways to do that but have the goal of the company to turn the fuel card business, as I said, into our corporate payments business. So work in process. 
Darrin Peller: Yes. No, that's helpful. And just one quick follow-up, if you don't mind, is on the -- your preliminary outlook for next year. When you talk about the different assumptions, I guess, first of all, the reported -- the revenue growth target you talked, I think you said 10% organic. Is that -- that's organic, I'm assuming? Is that reported or constant currency? I think it's -- and then also, when we think of the $17, just the assumptions on fuel and macro that go into that, again, it seems like the underlying core assumptions are sustainable and seem like they've really gotten to a point that's been strong. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. So on the first one, I'd say, we're kind of halfway through, Darrin, the '23 budget cycle. So we've worked on revenue, obviously, harder than the expense and the profit side. So as I said, it's a mix of the different business lines, fuel, lodging, Brazil and corporate payments have different growth rates to kind of weight themselves to 10%. That is an organic number, although the print at this point looks pretty similar because we have some pro forma revenue kind of rolling forward, right, from '22 to '23 offset by what we think could be some macro headwinds, particularly FX.
 So at this point, year-to-date, not a big difference between organic and print. And then on the bottom, again, I think the thing we can control is really the operating margin. So we're doing a lot of work on metering the OpEx so that we can grow kind of EBITDA margins, 200 or 300 bps next year. So call it, I don't know, we're coming on, I think, around 52-ish this year that we try to get that up a couple of points.
 And then the wild card is really the below the line after today's Fed call, I'm not sure how encouraged or not any of us should be. But wherever that number flies to and then descends and then obviously, the FX, particularly the pound. So that's really the wait and see. So we're just trying to give a rough super early days view, obviously, hopefully, all us will know a bunch more in 90 days. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. 
Ramsey El-Assal: I wanted to first ask about Russia. And maybe if you wouldn't mind updating us on the size of that business, so we kind of contemplate what it might mean to take it out of numbers. And also just -- I'm pretty sure the answer here is it's not contemplated in that preliminary read of next year, but the idea would be if you came to an agreement there to sell the business that we would then need to sort of get that out of our models next year? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Ramsey, it's Ron. So yes, both good questions. So on the first one, it obviously depends on the FX, the kind of ballpark gets $100 million-ish, little bit more in revenue at kind of a 75% EBITDA margin, again, kind of where the FX is today. And yes, we haven't done anything in terms of taking it out although, of course, we've looked at models where we sell it for X and we use that cash to buy back, which really manages obviously the dilution as we look into next year. So we'll certainly keep you guys apprised. We're kind of live out shopping the thing now. So we'll keep you posted. 
Alissa Vickery: And I'll just add. This is Alissa. The specifics around Russia have been included in our 10-Q disclosures previously as well in terms of sizing. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Great. Great. One quick follow-up for me. On the FTC matter, I guess, first, is there any sense of timing in terms of when this might be resolved? Is this the type of thing now where there's a relatively protracted negotiation? Or will it be resolved sort of in short order to the degree that you can tell?
 And then, Ron, you seem pretty confident there's no P&L impact here. Is there any best or worst case type of outcomes? Or is it really like no matter how the cookie crumbles here you guys are going to come out of it okay? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. On the first one, we're clearly on some kind of glide path, right, the things in the sense so a guess would be a couple of months -- 2, 3 months, depending on how the [ chitchat ] goes and when the court gets back involved if they do. So that would be my guess.
 On the impact, yes, there's nothing either in their order, which the judge said no to or really anything we're contemplating because it's disclosure based, again, Ramsey, right? It's not, hey, we can't charge something or we can't sign up a customer or whatever. And so the good news is, we've done a bunch of things and had a chance to see. And obviously, we're reporting those changes are embedded right in the results we're putting out.
 So again, there's nothing we can see that would have any material go-forward impact. So probably like you and others on the call, we mostly just want to get on the other side. We've repeatedly said just be specific, tell us what it is that makes everyone happy and we're happy to do it. And so we've done a lot of that. 
 And again, it's had little to no impact. I mean when you can sign up 96% of a couple of hundred thousand customers to say they want to continue affirmatively with your program, and you've given them the biggest Ts and Cs in boxes that you have, it makes me feel pretty confident that we've been straight ahead with people. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: I guess a question for you, Ron, just on the valuations for M&A. I mean it seems like there's been a pretty marked decline in fintech valuations. I'm just curious if you're seeing anything pop into your wheelhouse, how we should balance that relative to share repurchases? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Sanjay. I think to your point, there has been some -- a bit of a reset in the last few months. And you could see by what we've announced in this quarter that -- when we started the process, we focused on these capability things because no matter what the price is they're about capabilities, and they're not large amounts of absolute money. We do have a couple of, what I'll call, more traditional kind of FLEETCOR in the wheelhouse deals that seem to be in ranges that we like that we can transact at. 
 And then second, I think, let's see how the thing plays out. As you know, people move their valuation aspirations with time. And so to the extent that people wait and stuff doesn't trade, we think there could be even a further reset next year because right some people are getting squeezed these days. So we're optimistic that things will get better, and we can go back to targeting some larger deals. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Okay. Just a follow-up. Alissa, you mentioned the fuel price softness -- sorry, the fuel softness, volume softness. And I'm just curious, if we just dig underneath that, is there something going on there? Do you think it's macro driven? Or what's driving that? And then just a clarification on the interest expense. So we should target around $300 million of net interest expense. Just want to make sure I got that number right. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Sanjay, it's Ron. Why don't I take the first one and then let Alissa take the second one. So no, I'd say the fuel kind of volume and transactions, I think we reported, I think, 4% volume growth, transaction growth for the quarter. I would say it's pocketed. There's a couple of spots like SMB Trucking that are a bit softer than normal, although most of that's offset by enterprise, the big trucking firms.
 I think the biggest thing, Sanjay, is in some of the research we deal with kind of local SMB accounts is the higher price had a smidge of elasticity, kind of moved them back a little bit like, hey, we'll shrink the radius of where we do a plumbing call. We won't go 30 miles out of the city now, we'll only go 10 miles and stuff. And so I do think when the prices were at those peaks, whatever, 3, 4, 5 months ago, that, that also dialed it back a bit.
 But I'd say we're in the smidgy level. It's really nothing significant and it's really nothing across the board. Do you want to take on interest? 
Alissa Vickery: So Sanjay, it's Alissa. So on the interest side, I think you're asking about going into '23. So everybody in the world seems to know that Fed Funds target rates have just skyrocketed. We'll close out the year somewhere around 3.75%. As a reminder, we all started around 0. And then going into 2023, targeting somewhere around 4.5% to 5% for the year. And so we're really out looking at interest expense probably around $300 million plus. So maybe I would take our number and multiply it by 2 and you're probably in the ballpark. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, that's the net number, too, Sanjay, right? There's kind of gross interest expense, and then we've got a bunch of cash at high rates. So to Alissa's point, the gross numbers significantly larger, probably comes down 20% or 25% with the cash that we have offsetting it. But look, it is a total swag route. We're sitting here like you guys trying to guess what the next 14 months are going to be. And we don't know. So we just said, hey, we'll take what we're hearing. We'll kind of run the math that way, and will be a lot higher when we talk again. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. 
Andrew Jeffrey: I appreciate you taking the time to answer my question this afternoon. Ron, some pretty encouraging commentary on margin next year. Can you talk a little bit about how much of that is being driven by cloud migration and digital sales initiatives versus maybe being a little bit more selective in terms of the customers you sign up in the current macro environment? And then if we get a recovery, would we expect, say, in '24, would we expect the margin to sort of come back down a little bit as you lean in to new customer growth a bit more? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. That's a really good question, Andrew. So I'd say that the target that we like to see in the company is 55%. Again, I think we'll pencil around 52% this year. But that thing moves around based on things we buy, right, that run lower margins or weirdo stuff like COVID that crushes revenue quickly and stuff. But I'd say our running internal targets closer to 55%. 
 In terms of next year, I think the 2 things you picked up. One is, we knew this was going to be a half a year. I mean, we're going to, I think, be about $0.70 higher than we told in February. I don't know if anyone's applauding, but I consider that good news to do better than we said. And so because we saw that, we kind of opened the spicket. We let people work to your point on some additional projects. We tested some additional things. We staffed up in areas we spend, I'd say, money that we could afford to kind of make the targets that we run the company on.
 So when I see the world tightening, the answer is, we'll be a little bit more approval, a little bit more selective to use your word. And I think the big thing is really around our view of the economy and the credit environment, particularly around the digital side, like you said, because that's where the sales growth, if you will, versus the credit risk are supercorrelated. 
 So my guess is we'll kind of enter the thing a bit cautious, kind of cut a little bit of the tail at the bottom. I would initially maybe not try to grow that thing in the low to mid-20%, but maybe 3 to 5 points lower and see how it goes. So it would be just a little bit of a guide on kind of overall OpEx and a little bit of caution around the micro selling and related credit risk. 
Andrew Jeffrey: And in lodging, this is a business that you've been adamant, is awesome, and you've definitely been right in terms of the growth. What do you think that looks like as we lap some tougher compares. What's the normalized growth rate do you think for that lodging business? 
Ronald F. Clarke: I think it's high teens to 20%. To your point, we have some favorable comps. We've got a segment in there for airlines, which are obviously in the ditch. So some of it is that. But we're just -- all parts of that business are kind of going great. We're selling a lot in all 3 of them. We bought a new software front end for that airline business and airlines are looking to get added in-house work and stuff.
 So we have the best network, the best rates to offer the different clients that we have. And so between the scale and the selling machine that we have there and the product, they're pretty specialized offering. So there's not lots of other players that can offer really what we do both the convenience and the pricing. So I'd say it's in the high teens to 20% on a normalized basis. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Sheriq Sumar with Evercore ISI. 
Sheriq Sumar: I have a question on the cross-selling opportunities. I mean it's been a quarter -- it's been like a few quarters where you have talked about growing it a bit slow on that front just not to upset the customers and the process. But, a, what's the update on that process or on the cross-selling opportunities? And is there a potential for you to ramp up the cross-selling efforts going into 2023? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I think I kind of covered, Sheriq, this comment a bit before, but I'd say it's still a work in process. I think it's my summary that we went headlong into the thing targeting the smaller clients that we have because we have so many of them. And as we get into the thing, we got clear that corporate payments turns on spend, not on client count and that about 5,000 of our clients have about half of all the spend, all the purchasing.
 So we've gone back and targeted those. We have some of our blue-suited salespeople going into our biggest dual card accounts now and selling corporate payments, but we're still trying to figure out, is there a scene, is there a different place inside of our fuel card client base where we can bring corporate payments offerings. So I think a lot of this is like anything that's new. We're learning. We're trying to figure out what the sweet spot is among the super big base and what the product is that fits that sweet spot. So we haven't given up, still work in process. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Pete Christiansen with Citi. 
Peter Christiansen: Nice updates there, Ron. I've 2 questions. One, I wanted to go back to the 12% organic growth that you're seeing in the tolls business. Just wondering, if you could tease that out a little bit, the base tolls business versus some of the Beyond Tolls initiatives that you put forth, including the tag fueling stuff. Wondering if you can give us a sense of how is that contributing to segment growth at this point? And then I have a follow-up. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Pete, it's good to hear from me. So that one, I think, for Sheriq's question a minute ago was one that's working, I think we're at about 20% now of the revenue there and what we call Beyond Toll, parking, fuel. We've also gotten some super early traction on insurance right, where this vehicle mobility company with millions of customers and so offering insurance that centers around the vehicle and stuff has been a pretty good uptake.
 And so it's going well. The fuel number, which I said is exiting, we think around [ $10 million ] annualized exactly as we thought is kind of correlated to the number of sites. So as we add additional sites that basically can read the tag conveniently low and the old [ transgrow ] because more people use the thing. So we built a plan to continue that, take it up by another 25% or 30% next year.
 So look, the goal would be kind of over the next 2 or 3 years that, that stuff is in the 40% kind of range on top of the core business. And we continue to add -- I mean if there was -- it reminds me of coke here in the U.S. if there was another way to sell a toll tag in Brazil, we know it's like we sell it. In stores, we sell with hangs, things in stores. We sell it at toll booths. We sell it through car makers. We sell it through insurance guys. We sell literally every way that you can get a toll tag to market, we're doing -- selling way over 1 million new ones per year. And so it's a business that despite the competitive set up changing a lot is still performing great for us. Super happy with it. 
Peter Christiansen: Yes, that certainly sounds exciting. I'd like to pivot to fuel card sales a little bit here. I mean, obviously, when we had fuel prices starting to peak up earlier in the year, I'm sure that was helpful in driving new sales, maybe giving you some -- a good degree of inbound activity. Now gas prices come down, diesel is still holding up pretty strong. What's your sense for how fuel prices today are still driving fuel card sales. Is there a tailwind still there? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. No, that's a really good question. They're super related to your point, if you think about, particularly on the digital side, just raw demand, Google counting how many people key in fuel card. You hit it on the head back in the spring or early summer at the peak, that thing was up a lot, right, that inbound demand. But remember, we still sell, I don't know, 40%, 45% of the business nondigitally and some amount -- a decent amount of our digital is us targeting accounts.
 So I'd say it's down some from the peak although the peak reside than we've seen before at an [ edgy path ]. The only thing I'd said back is even at today's current price over the last, call it, whatever, 5 or 7 years, this is still at a super high level. So I'd say, yes, down a bit from the peak, but still -- is still pretty robust. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Jeff Cantwell with Wells Fargo Securities. 
Jeffrey Cantwell: And just wanted to follow up on some of the questions that are coming your way. One of them was, can you talk to us a little bit about some of the early underlying assumptions for fuel in 2023. And the way I wanted to frame the question is, if we're all looking at Exhibit 2 in your press release, which is fuel transactions, fuel revenue per transaction.
 Do you have any sense of what the growth rates there would look like for next year in order to get you to mid- to high single-digit revenue growth in fuel. 
 And then along the same lines, this is obviously a very dynamic macro environment that interest rate environment. The goalpost is clearly moving all the time. So my second question is, can you talk about what you think is a range, right, your confidence? And whether there's a wider range in that potential outlook for next year versus prior years? And like do you kind of feel that the upside, downside to the mid-high single digit is the same as in past years or maybe it's wider this year. I'd just love to hear your thoughts there. 
Alissa Vickery: All right. Jeff, it's Alissa. So in terms of fuel price assumptions going into next year, we basically left next year consistent with the current period. So we've assumed fuel prices in the range of $4.37 or so with a little bit of downside on the spreads. In terms of your question on rev per trans, I think our intent is generally to always have a nice balance between volume and rate to the extent that there's incremental products being offered. And so now I would say that we would continue to expect that to be a balanced approach. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Jeff, this is Ron. Let me just jump on what Alissa said, obviously, mix continues to help us right. We've overrotated to SMB. So we get sequential rate happy just from the mix because we get more rate on smaller accounts than big.
 But on the macro question, I'd say, who knows. I'd say it seems you guys are sitting on the planet with me, it's crazy kind of volatile, not only the things for us like fuel prices, but clearly, FX volatility is super high this year. I don't even want to mention interest rate volatility.
 And so the question is, in 90 days when we get to kind of locking down, finalizing our plan, will the forward view be any clearer, will there be messaging that, that thing is going to stabilize some. And so that's my answer to you to the extent that the big macro things seem like the volatility is slowing, we'll probably use kind of some traditional range. And to the extent that those macro things have a bigger bait around them, then yes, we probably would have something wider to let you know how those things affect us.
 But I said a million times, like we run the company here forever. And we're going to run the company to generate growing revenue and growing certainly EBITDA profits faster and the below the line stuff will come and go. No one's clapping that I can hear that the macro is at our back, and we have $0.70 more, $100 million -- $150 million more in revenue. No one's clapping, understand the other way. So we just -- our game is we just power through it. 
 And look, it can't go up forever. If interest rates go up, the cost goes up to $300 million -- and actually it was going to $500 million in '24, maybe they're going to add a $250 million. And so as long as we can keep compounding the top and the EBITDA line, [ 10 and 13 ] we're going to deliver mid- to high teens EPS over the forecast period. So I'd say we just don't see any of these variables continuing to rise sequentially year-over-year. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. 
Mihir Bhatia: Want to second the -- thanks for the updates on the FTC Russia and also the early look on 2023, very helpful. And maybe I did want to start on interest expense just for 2023. I apologize to go back to this, but I just want to make sure we have it right. The $300 million to $320-ish million that you've talked about. Does that include Russia? I think that if I recall correctly, there's a fairly high interest rate there, which you're getting and high cash balance, which helps that. So since it's a net number, does that include the Russia benefit, I guess? 
Alissa Vickery: Mihir, it's Alissa. So, yes, it would include any benefit that we're getting off of the deposits that are in Russia certainly on the income side. We don't really have any expense -- interest expense in that region. So it's really... 
Ronald F. Clarke: It's payments, Mihir, again. This number, I mean it's a rounding error in the business... 
Alissa Vickery: We do see rates going down in Russia. So hopefully, it's not too big for a loss. 
Mihir Bhatia: Right. And then the other question I wanted to ask was just in terms of lodging, I just wanted to understand a little bit more about the Roomex acquisition in terms of just expanding your workforce lodging business into Europe. Is that -- how much of the business was in Europe anyway? And is this like more of a beachhead where you grow from here? Or just trying to understand a little bit more about that. 
Ronald F. Clarke: That's a good question. Thanks for that. So the Roomex business, first of all, is really a copycat of our U.S., what we call workforce. If you think about a lot of the blue collar people to travel for work. That's kind of what that Roomex thing is. So we were delighted to identify someone that does kind of the same thing.
 So it's really a U.K. business today. It's got a little bit, I can't remember, 5% maybe of its business in Germany. So the majority of it is in the U.K., which is our second largest market, which was interesting to us. And so yes, the idea there is, hey, they've got assets that sit in the U.K., they've got a lodging network that's attractive. They have sales, they have ops, they have tech that runs there.
 And we have a ton of clients, as you can imagine, like tons of clients and actually a fair number of kind of midsized  and enterprise clients there. So the idea is, hey, we know this business super well. It's in a market that we've got a good position so we can accelerate it and it's a good business on its own. It's got a good group of people. 
 So it's really just like our fuel card business or other businesses. We're a global player. We have a business that looks exactly like a business we have, and it's in another country that we can understand then we go there. We liked the price back to someone's question earlier about M&A valuations, I think was a reasonable price for both sides, which is why the trade works. So yes, it will certainly accelerate and it kind of sets us up to make a business with bigger TAM that we can understand. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Bob Napoli with William Blair. 
Robert Napoli: Nice job on quarter. I appreciate the outlook for next year. Just I was hoping to get maybe a little bit more color on -- I appreciate the segment margins that you started giving us. But just with margin expansion next year, where are you most confident in margin expansion next year and then maybe over the long term? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Bob, it's good to hear your voice and that you're up and at 'em here, so good to hear from you. We don't really plan the margin expansion really by lines of business. The discretionary monies that are big in our company are sales and IT. And so that's how we think about it. For us to boost EBITDA margins 200 basis points will just kind of flatten out a little bit, not grow as fast some of the sales investment and IT.
 And people may say, "Oh, how is that going to work? Well, when you make a pretty big investment incrementally like we did this year, you pick up the productivity really in the forward years, right, because you've hired new people or you've got new leads in the pipeline. And so some of the investments -- incremental investments we made in '22 will kind of roll in, we'll pour into '23. So we've got a decent game plan of OpEx that will service the business we have and meet the growth targets. And again, because we spent a bit more this year, that's kind of helpful to us for next year. 
Robert Napoli: Great. And just like a big picture question. Which part of your business are you most excited about over the next 3 to 5 years, that's going to become a much bigger piece of your business, if you would? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Matt, like you, I know it's your favorite. I mean, it's hard not to like what we call our corporate payments business just because of the enormity. The market we -- if you guys -- you may get a kick out of the story, but I moved a guy that ran -- who still runs our international fleet business to run our old business.
 So he's here, and I'm talking to them the other night, so we get on the corporate payments, cheese he says, I never understood like what a mess the U.S. is, all this paper and trying to pay from. And so like I think as we live here, we don't even think about it, that it's just the opportunity there to make that just a gigantic business. It's -- in our prelims it's closing in on $1 billion next year, and we spent -- no one knows this better than you a couple of years getting all the puzzle pieces together so that we've got kind of a full suite of stuff.
 And so I just think that the potential is so big and the competition, even though you and others keep talking about -- [ friggin ] fintechs, I tell you the whole market is banks and Amex, and we're winning. That's where 90% of our business comes from. And so we -- we just like the chances to bring what we have at great sales again in Q3, record sales. And so that's the business that will be dramatically bigger in the next few years. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research. 
Kenneth Suchoski: I just had a clarification question on Russia. Does the $17 EPS figure include the EPS contribution from Russia. And I just -- can you talk a little bit about how you're able to actually access the proceeds from a sale of that Russia business. Just want to make sure that we have that right. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Ken, it's Ron. Yes, on the first one. We haven't sold a business, so it's still part of our planning, although again, the idea that we have would be to take the cash from the sale and obviously, the retained earnings that we have sitting there. And if our stock stays at this price, so obviously buy a lot of it, which will compress the dilution.
 In terms of the proceeds, it's how we're going to set it up with a buyer. The buyer is going to have to basically be able to pay us outside of there. So it's one of the kind of the conditions of the buyers that we're looking at. So we do have a way basically depending on who the buyer is for them to be able to pay us. 
Kenneth Suchoski: Okay. Great. That's really helpful, Ron. And then I appreciate all the continued disclosure on profitability by segment. I just had a follow-up question to Bob's question. I mean it looks like the corporate payments business has a 43% EBITDA margin. Is there an opportunity to bring that segment margin up closer to the corporate average over the long term? Or do you have to continue invest in that business to drive that high teens revenue growth? 
Ronald F. Clarke: That's another super good question. So kind of a 2-part question. The first one is really scale, right, trying to make that business in some of the pieces dramatically bigger. So like all of our businesses, it's got a lot of fixed cost, call it, 40% to 50% of the cost structure of that business is fixed. So clearly, the incremental margins are better.
 And then it's really just the trade for growth, like we -- it's not a hard math for you guys, if you want to grow something at 20% versus 10% or 8%, you have to spend more money, right, to grow it faster. And so that's really the second part of it is, given the TAM, given the size of the opportunity, we'll probably continue to overinvest and run, that EBITDA margin is a bit lower than the line average. But again, it's because we're setting it up to grow faster.
 It's not a reason -- just there's nothing structurally. In other words, if you said to me, that thing gets to $1.5 billion or $2 billion, and I want to take the growth rate down on the line average, there's nothing structurally that would stop us from having that business look an awful lot like the rest of our line average businesses. 
Operator: Our next question will come from John Davis with Raymond James. 
John Davis: Ron, I just wanted a little -- talk a little bit about bad debt expense and have you tightened the credit box at all? I know we've just kind of normalized, but given what most feel is some sort of macro softness coming at some point, have you contemplated that, especially when you talk about kind of mid- to high single-digit fuel growth next year? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Good question, John. Yes, is the short answer. So I think we hope we reported this, but I think we have to, call it, [ 25, 25, 35, 35 ] is kind of a guesstimate at the full year credit loss number. And so when we saw the thing the forwards, the roll rates get a bit worse, we did tighten the new account selling. So we have 2 kinds of credit; one is, hey, who are we going to take in. We used to take in 10 people, 10 companies, now we're going to take in 8, so we're going to cut the tail off. 
 And then the second one is really credit lines, right for customers that we have, right? If we're willing to give you more credit to buy more things, we can get more revenue. So that's the one that we're looking at pulling back selectively kind of in certain areas. So we've done it on new. We haven't done it yet on existing and partly because we have much better information, right? The underwriting is much better on our existing customers because we have all that payment history on them.
 So that's a key thing for us to watch is really the trade. Remember, probably about half of all of our credit losses, whatever 25, 25, 35, 35 as up to whatever, $120 million, $130 million, half of that, John, is basically tied to new business. right, which is a way high number versus the base. So that's the place that we always start. 
John Davis: Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow up on the margin commentary going into next year. As I think about fuel prices probably being flat to down a little bit higher, at least for the full year, bad debt expense, I'm penciling out that kind of OpEx is going to be kind of flat to down year-over-year to get to kind of 200 to 300 basis points of margin expansion? Just -- I know you said you spent a lot kind of given the outperformance this year on kind of the better COVID recovery. But I just want to kind of make sure that, that pencils and that you can kind of hold the line on OpEx in order to get back to kind of what you call it normalized profitability kind of in the mid-50s on an EBITDA margin basis. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Again, I want to make sure people clear. It's super early days. We're doing what we call the envelope work of framing what an envelope is. So we're far from done. But I think the biggest difference to what you said is that the sales investment and the nature of the sales investment has a huge impact on the bad debt on a forward basis. So the easiest way for us to improve profitability in 2023 would slow or cut the tail, certainly in the digital micro accounts and keep all that bad debt out of our P&L.
 So that's the most logical place. But yes, it's not far off what you're saying that the exit rate of our OpEx will obviously grow probably low single digits. And then what you said, it depends obviously were fuel prices. But remember, that also ties, it's correlated to bad debt. right? So one of the reasons our bad debt is higher again is our fuel price was higher here in 2022.
 If the fuel price is lower, by definition, the bad debt will be lower. So look, lots of these variables move together. And my messaging is just to tell everybody that we're going to run the business kind of macro constant and then open our eyes to what the macro is and make OpEx and capital allocation pivots based on what we see. And what we're seeing now is we're probably going to slow the OpEx. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Trevor Williams from Jefferies. 
Trevor Williams: I was hoping you guys could unpack the 4Q guidance a bit and some of the moving pieces because it implies revenues down more than $20 million Q3 to Q4. Typical seasonality for you guys is up $20 million plus in normal years, at least. I guess fuel prices are lower sequentially. You've got the pull forward in gift, some of the softness in U.S. SMB and Fleet, but anything else moving pieces-wise you'd call out organically for why you aren't seeing the same normal Q3 to Q4 step out? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I'll jump on that in to listen. I think you named kind of most of them. I'm sure it's -- whatever you're saying, kind of plus or minus $10 million on whatever, $900 million. So it's not a material kind of number. But those are it. It's kind of a flip flopping this year versus last. Back last year, there was some huge late gift orders because retailers are out of stock from being careful.
 And so that number was a pretty big whopper number, if I remember, in Q4 last year. And this year, they said, "hey, we getting ready sooner" and so put tons of orders in earlier. And then what you said, we're running at, I don't know, $4.30-or-something fuel price, which has ticked down, obviously, from Q2 to Q3 and then into Q4, which takes them off the talk. But then again, it helps expenses.
 As I said earlier, both borrowings and bad debt. So the biggest thing is just the normal seasonality. What you said if we look at the last, whatever years you cleaned up, pro forma acquisitions or stuff, 2 or 3 of our business is soft in a fair amount, which is less workdays in the fourth quarter, both here and abroad. And so it's just -- it's really just that, that Q4 and Q1 are just less workdays or softer. And Q2 and Q3 are higher. And so there's not -- there's really nothing like super-duper going on, like as we model the thing to embed the guidance here, I would say there's nothing else that sticks out. 
Alissa Vickery: It's Alissa. I'll just add on to that a little bit. We talked about it earlier in the call that interest expense really is significantly worse than where -- I think we all projected even from the Fed's perspective back in July when we were getting our previous guidance. And so that is a big headwind going into the fourth quarter. 
Ronald F. Clarke: I mean just for you guys, like I don't how you see this, but hey, we're kind of saying put in the second half, the revenue for second half is a bit higher than we said 90 days ago, and I guess the profits are the same. I said before, our macro was off by $8 million, the runway interest expenses, whatever, $20 million higher. So underneath the hood, we've been able to do some things to make the thing work.
 So the trend and the performance, again, separate from the macro, my message would be a pretty good kind of as good or better than we thought 90 days ago. So we're not seeing any kind of blinking red lights yet. And like all the questions on this call, the profitability a lot will turn on where those macro things land in glidepath next year.
 But I just do want to remind people that like to own stock for more than a week that what comes up, does come down and things don't keep going up for multiple years in a row. And so don't forget, the [ figure ] went up this year, right, in 2022, fuel prices went up, interest rates are going to be -- started obviously lower. And so these things will move again. I just don't think we've ever seen volatility like this, honestly. The amount of movement in some of these factors in the time frame that they've moved. That's what seems strange to us. 
Trevor Williams: Yes. Understood. And then just as a follow-up on corporate payments. Just thinking about the macro sensitivity there. If we go back to 2020, perfect storm of the stuff that worked against you. But I think some of the cyclical exposure there had been a bit of a surprise.
 Now today, you've got AFEX, Global Reach is going to close shortly. So you'll have more FX hedging and cross-border exposure than you did 2 years ago. I know you're saying high teens is a target for next year. But kind of with that pro forma revenue mix, any view just on how that segment should hold up in a recession kind of where you'd be most vulnerable, the pieces of revenue you think should be most durable? Any help there would be great. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Another good question. I'd say it will hold up well. And the reason is COVID is -- was a bizarre macro thing, right, keeping people at home. And so it picked off hard companies, cruise ships companies that made a living working, so we had some punishing set of clients. The great news about the corporate payments business is the majority of the payments are locked.
 I think rents in IT services companies mostly can't get out of the AP that's in front of them, even if their own situation softens some. And then, b, you heard again today, there's inflation, which rolled into obviously, company spend. And so I'd say of all the businesses, that went ought to hold up well because the spend is pretty fixed and will likely go up. And then on the cross-border side, I think you hit it, FX volatility, a little bit like high fuel prices creates greater interest in FX management. 
 And so  to the extent that different countries have differential plans on interest rates, which triggers FX volatility, that should be helpful to that business, which we're seeing now. So all in all, I'd say, we like the chances for the business next year. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Andrew Polkowitz with JPMorgan. 
Andrew Polkowitz: Just one, getting back to the M&A side. I know you mentioned that you feel increasingly good about your positioning of the company broadly and obviously, Global Reach further and the FX business, Roomex and Levarti on the lodging side. I was curious which areas are most interesting for you guys right now looking for incremental M&A next year? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Andrew, it's Ron. That's a good question. I would say that we've done a lot of the positioning work literally last year and this year. If you look at the beyond strategies of building out what segments we can play in like our Corpay One business for SMB and corporate payments or the lodging thing being international or the front end of our mid-market corporate payments business with a process AP automation tools. So I think we really assembled like a lot of products and a lot of capability so that those TAMs are bigger, and that's the sales and revenue we can chase are bigger.
 I think we're kind of ready to pivot back to more of the wheelhouse scale base, let's buy stuff, we can run better sets of businesses. I'm not saying that we won't do more if there's probably some more stuff around EV that we're snipping that's still in that kind of capability thing. We want to be super good there, already there. But that would be the thing. Any 1 of the 2 or 3 main businesses, corporate pay and lodging for sure, where we could get wheelhouse deals that are larger and accretive would be the #1 preference. 
Andrew Polkowitz: Got it. That's helpful. And one quick follow-up. You actually just mentioned the EV. I was going to ask on -- you mentioned your -- all your methods of toll distribution before and reaching consumers. So I wanted to ask if you could draw some parallel to your consumer side ambitions in the EV space and what you could share with us there? I know it's early still. 
Ronald F. Clarke: No, it's a good follow-up. It's one of the things, one of the models that we know well that caused us -- allowed us -- allowed me to pull the trigger on an EV business that it was consumer-centric. And what we realize there's no credit risk. It's really a network play, building a super duper EV network it's advantage it sounded a lot like the toll. So I think the biggest translation is partners could help.
 So if you think about the consumer business in Brazil, yes, there's a lot of direct capability, having hundreds of people stand at toll booths or in malls or kiosks and stuff. But the partner model that our Brazil guys have built, every Nissan car with a toll tag when you come in at 2 of the largest banks, reselling our stuff at a 40 million accounts that model of OEMs that make EV cars aren't going to be EV cars unless the existing or new EV manufacturers make them, and same with CPOs, there's not going to be any cars that people can't recharge them.
 And so those 2 partners, the light went on for us, "Oh my gosh, we can build a consumer business kind of B2B2C by working through these partners and they're going to embrace us. So that's kind of the thinking and that's the feedback we've had from talking to those various groups. So it allows us to basically getting in our gun sites, a new extension for our company without doing some were Super Bowl ad, right, to try to get to consumers. So that's the thing that we like about it. 
Andrew Polkowitz: Got it. I know [indiscernible] Super Bowl ad. So I'll leave it there and congrats on the result. 
Operator: Our next question will come from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. 
James Faucette: Thanks a lot for all the color and perspective. Just a couple of quick follow-up questions from me. You guys have been really active in buying back your own shares, obviously. But at the same time, you have started to pick up the acquisition activity as valuations have come down. How should we be thinking about like capital allocation priorities and where you're seeing opportunities? And should we -- that kind of offer continuation of the current mix? Or what are your expectations there right now? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, James, it's Ron. The answer is it depends, right? Our capital allocation priorities, I think, are unchanged. We start with deals because they position the company and most of the ones we do create accretion. So that's been obviously number one. But it depends really on our stock price. Obviously, the stock price were buyers with a better company to buy than people shop and be companies for higher multiples.
 And so if our price is at these levels, I think we're probably leading to buying more stock back mostly because of what I said that we've gotten so many of the positioning or extension, the strategic deals, if you will, kind of behind us. We kind of have the set of things we need to run the company. So at today's stock price, I'd say, we're probably more buyers of our stock than something else. At higher stock prices probably, the pendulum swings back a bit the other way. 
James Faucette: I appreciate that. And then just a quick follow-up on kind of the fraud and debt issues. How much of that is just purely function of fuel prices. And as those come down, that self-resolves? Or are you seeing anything different in the current cycles than you have previously that could indicate it could be kind of an ongoing issue even if fuel prices do come down next year? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. That's a super good point. It's most of it, right? So higher fuel prices, right, create more total spend. So the loss event is higher, right, 100 gallons at $5 instead of 100 gallons of $3. And then second it attracts more fraud, right? You get targeted more by criminals, again, when the price is higher. 
 So really, the question is, if that normalizes, those 2 things should improve. And then it really swings over to just the economic health, right, of clients and prospects for us. Do they remain healthy and able to repay and stuff? And so that's the open question, I think. We're not seeing a lot of that. If we look at our distributions, the higher quality accounts are repaying, the roll rate problems like always are in the more credit challenged group. So it should reset if fuel prices stay at this level or smidge down, both fraud and overall loss levels will decline. 
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session as well as the conference. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-08-03 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to Paymentus' Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]
 At this time, I would like to hand the call over to Paul Seamon, Vice President, Financial and Strategy for some introductory comments. Please go ahead. 
Paul Seamon: Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Paymentus' Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today are Dushyant Sharma, our Founder and CEO; and Matt Parson, our CFO. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take questions.
 Our press release was issued after the close of market today and is posted on our website, where this call is being simultaneously webcast. The webcast replay of this call and the supplemental slides accompanying this presentation will be available on our company's website under the Investor Relations link at ir.paymentus.com.
 Statements made on this webcast include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements use words such as will, believe, expect, anticipate and similar phrases that denote future expectation or intent regarding our financial results and guidance. The impact of continued economic uncertainty and inflation, our market opportunities, business strategy, implementation timing, product enhancements, impacts from acquisitions and other matters. These forward-looking statements speak as of today and we undertake no obligation to update them.
 These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements, including the risks and uncertainties set forth under the captions, special note regarding forward-looking statements, and risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which we filed with the SEC on March 3rd, 2022. Our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, which we expect to file with the SEC in early August 2022 and elsewhere in our filings with the SEC. We encourage you to review these detailed safe harbor and risk factor disclosures.
 In addition, during today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, specifically contribution profit, adjusted gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful in measuring our performance and liquidity, should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP results.
 We encourage you to review additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our earnings press release issued today and the supplemental slides for this webcast, each available on the Investor Relations page of our website and in our filings with the SEC.
 With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dushyant Sharma, our Founder and CEO. 
Dushyant Sharma: Thanks, Paul. We believe the business performed well in the second quarter, with momentum in both sales and revenues. The revenue increased $26.5 million or 28.3% to $120 million. Contribution profit in the quarter grew 30.2% to $48.7 million, driven by a 39.4% increase in transactions. Our sales engine continue to be strong with signings of more than 60 deals again this quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to over 125. This number of signings is more than 50% higher versus the same period last year.
 Notwithstanding the challenging economic environment, including inflationary pressures and the session, these results illustrate why we believe our business is resilient. In spite of the current headwinds, we are seeing around client-based implementation delays and inflation, which we will talk more about later in these prepared remarks. We remain excited about our fundamental business operations and long-term prospects.
 We continue to drive implementations forward and had a number of client implementation success stories in the quarter. One example is the implementation of one of the largest utilities in the country. This client serves a very large footprint across the country and selected us to handle the complexity of the nationwide implementation. We also completed the migration of a large municipality with JPMorgan support. A third client we implemented in the quarter was a top 20 credit union with over $10 billion in assets.
 As we continue to move up market, this is our third financial services client with over $10 billion in assets launched on our banking IPN platform. As you know, the pricing model for banking bill payments is not affected by interchange. Also in the quarter, we received the Pacesetter Awards for 2022 from a large enterprise software company utilities user group, recognizing Paymentus for its leadership in billing and payment innovation. We are proud of this award and believe it exemplifies the strength of our billing and payments product and innovation.
 We also completed integration with one of the leading providers of electronic health care records in the quarter along with adding advanced payment functionality for the health care vertical to our product. Although we believe we had a solid financial performance this quarter, the difficult economic climate is not without impact on us. Implementation and onboarding is one of the primary areas we are seeing impacted by these difficult economic times.
 A few of our larger deployments, which were originally slated to go live in Q2 and the back half of 2022 have been stressed out due to lack of client IT resource availability. Due primarily to these client-based slowdowns, we are changing our full year 2022 guidance. However, I'd like to make it clear that in better economic climate with normal implementation time lines, it specifically relate to these clients, I believe we would be meeting or beating existing guidance for 2022.
 If you take a long-term view of the business as we do, these delays are not particularly significant, especially considering that the anticipated financial benefits from these clients are merely delayed to future quarters, not lost. Matt will cover the details as he discusses our financial results and revised guidance. Matt? 
Matt Parson: Thanks, Dushyant. As a reminder, today's discussion includes non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the tables in our press release and supplemental slides for a reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
 In the second quarter, we processed 89.5 million transactions, which is a 39.4% increase over the same period last year. Transaction volume was driven by Biller Direct with tailwinds from IPN, Payveris and B2B transactions. The transaction growth led to a revenue increase of 28.3% in the quarter, which resulted in revenue of a $120 million. Contribution profit was $48.7 million, representing a 30.1% increase over Q2 last year.
 Consistent with the last several quarters, contribution profit grew a little faster than revenue, primarily due to an increased mix of transactions without interchange, specifically IPN transactions and B2B transactions. Contribution profit per transaction was $0.54, which was consistent with the past 2 quarters and our expectations. As we said multiple times in the past, fluctuations in areas outside our control like average payments or payment mix can impact contribution profit on a quarter-to-quarter basis.
 Historically, we have seen these things even out on a full year basis. However, given the ongoing economic uncertainty, we will continue to monitor these things very closely in the back half of the year. Adjusted gross profit increased $8.6 million or 28.6% in the quarter to $38.7 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $5 million for the second quarter, which represents a 10.3% adjusted EBITDA margin, which was a little softer than we expected primarily due to wage inflation.
 Operating expenses rose $13.2 million to $38.1 million for Q2 of 2022 from the same period last year. Overall, the increase in operating expenses from last year was driven by investments in staffing as well as additional operating expenses associated with Payveris and Finovera, the amortization of identified intangible assets from the acquisitions and stock-based compensation.
 Specifically R&D expense increased $2.3 million from the second quarter in 2021 to $10.2 million. Sales and marketing increased $8.3 million, driven by the Payveris acquisition, continued expansion of the sales team, adding partnerships to capture our sizable market opportunity and an increase in stock-based compensation.
 We experienced an increase in G&A expense of $2.6 million via our acquisition, multifold increases in the cost of corporate insurance and ongoing investment in public company infrastructure. Our GAAP net loss was $2.5 million and EPS for Q2 was negative $0.02. Non-GAAP net loss was $400,000 and non-GAAP EPS was 0 for the quarter.
 As of June 30, 2022, we had a $158.3 million of cash and cash equivalents for our balance sheet. Cash decreased primarily due to the timing of certain customer payments as well as increased operating expenses due to the acquisitions. At quarter end, we had approximately 122.6 million shares of common stock outstanding.
 Now turning to our 2022 full year outlook. Coming into Q2, we were comfortable with the guidance we gave. As Dushyant mentioned earlier, elongated implementation of onboarding times and this economic environment has created slower-than-expected net revenue recognition for the second half of 2022 of approximately $6 million to $8 million. But this revenue is not lost. It's just shifted into future quarters with the contract terms and TCV remaining the same.
 The inflationary environment has also compressed our contribution profit by a couple of million dollars. We were able to recapture some of the inflationary impact with price adjustments, some of which is already in process, but it takes a bit of time to recognize the impact.
 Based on these factors, we're changing our 2022 revenue outlook to the range of $485 million to $492 million. We're also changing our contribution profit guidance to be between $200 million and $204 million for the year, which is approximately 26% to 29% growth. We broadened the range due to the economic uncertainty, specifically the uncertain timing on implementation and potential for ongoing inflation.
 Just to provide some context on the stretched out implementation, in our Q3 call last year, we told you about a large new client win that would add 400 basis points to our then revenue run rate. It was our expectation that this client would go live in Q3 of this year. However, that client has now rescheduled to go live to 2023. We also have one other large implementation that has done the same. To be clear, we aren't expecting any loss of revenue associated with these clients. It's simply starting later than was originally anticipated, and we expect to start recognizing this revenue in 2023.
 We expect these delays to have a bigger impact on Q3, combined with the fact that Q3 is a lower contribution margin quarter seasonally. As a result, we anticipate little to no sequential contribution profit growth over Q2. Our adjusted EBITDA outlook is now in the range of $25 million to $29 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 13% to 14%. We are seeing ongoing wage pressure in our current workforce due to the levels of inflation, which is also putting some short-term pressure on our EBITDA margins.
 In addition, after seeing the current sales momentum, we expect to make additional investments in our sales and marketing efforts. Our current guidance reflects some assumptions around continued inflation and potential for increasing wage pressure, further expected delays in implementations could also impact our ability to meet our guidance. To be clear about our guidance, we widened our range to provide a better view on the spectrum of scenarios given the increased economic uncertainty. We expect to finish the year in the ranges we've laid out.
 Finally, as we said last quarter, we would anticipate our full year effective tax rate to be around 30%. However, due to the amortization of intangibles associated with the acquisition, the closer we are to breakeven on pretax book income, the more variation we could see on our tax rate. In addition, the permanent tax benefit from stock-based compensation continues to impact the rate.
 I'll now turn the call back over to Dushyant for some closing comments. 
Dushyant Sharma: Thanks, Matt. Before taking questions, I'd like to spend a little bit more time talking about the economy.
 In the quarter we experienced solid growth in the same-store sales. For example, in utilities, we saw close to 10% growth compared to second quarter of 2021. We believe the business can weather unusual level of inflation though, contribution profit growth would have been a little bit better without it. We have and will continue to manage through this environment by closely working with our clients as our contracts provide some flexibility to make changes over the medium term when the average transaction increases at the rate we have recently seen.
 We plan to maintain our responsible growth philosophy by keeping a balance between investing for future growth while continuing to look for ways to increase profitability in the near term. The vast majority of our expenses outside of interchange are people related. So we have the flexibility to add or pause hiring based on market conditions or the opportunities. And look, we have been in business for a long time, and the bottom line is, I don't like to lower guidance.
 But for client delays of this magnitude where the TCV, the total contract value, is over $100 million, any quarter they end up going live in is a good quarter, whether that is in 2022 or 2023. That's why it is not a big concern of ours, especially since these delays are related to the economic climate we are in. Therefore we believe our fundamental business is strong, sales momentum continues, water, insurance and tax bills continue to get paid, and we remain excited about the remainder of the year and the future.
 With that, I'd like to thank our over 1,000 employees for their commitment to serve our clients. And I'll now turn the call over to the operator for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Andrew Bauch with SMBC. 
Andrew Bauch: Just trying to square the commentary you made about the large client that decided to push it into first quarter '23. I mean part of it was the way I think about it is that in an environment where your customers are trying to maximize the amount of receipt of collections from consumers that may be facing financial difficulty. I could see a need for your solution in this time, more than others. But any additional color would be helpful. 
Dushyant Sharma: Andrew, first of all, good question. Actually, that's a great point. And frankly, as you can see from our signings in the bookings, if that trend continues to be strong. What's happening is it is when the operational aspect of implementation comes into play due to this post-pandemic inflationary environment, what we're observing is that clients are having difficulty finding IT resources. In fact, this remains a #1 topic.
 I was talking to our Head of Sales and he mentioned to me that almost every client please and with, they're talking about and thinking about how are they going to get it implemented and so on. So we are able to overcome a lot of those challenges because of the ease of implementation on our side. It takes because of the highly configurability nature -- configurable nature of our platform. But then it comes down to still you require some testing, some support, and that's where the declines are unfortunately struggling.
 And this, again, the point about the size of the customer we talked about and the total contract value in aggregate we mentioned. When you have a client -- group of clients of that size, you're always going to be open if they say hey, we're going to be delayed by a couple of quarters because our contracts allow us to recognize the entire value from the contract over the period the term, which starts on the day they go live. It's not when they start implementing. So from that perspective, that's what is really going on.
 Matt, do you want to add any? 
Matt Parson: Yes. I'd just say very good question. And the last part Dushyant was talking about the key point, which is it's really at least in what we've seen at this point limited to very large clients for the most part. Because your point is valid and we're still seeing small and medium-sized clients and some large ones too. Dushyant pointed out in the prepared remarks that are going live, it's just certain large organizations, I think, struggle more than others. 
Andrew Bauch: And then just a comment on the 125 deals closed year-to-date, I mean, I think that would be indicative that the sales pipeline is still relatively sound. And could you give us additional insight on to what kind of clients those kind of make up? Is the traditional verticals that you guys have been strong in? Are you experiencing is more in the B2B side? And maybe a sense of the sizing of those potential deals? 
Dushyant Sharma: Actually, the new signings tend to be a lot more diverse than historically our historical vertical. So we have customers in real estate, we have customers in commercial enterprises. Government entities tend to be a big factor as well now. And then obviously, our bread and butter implementations of the verticals. So it is more diverse than -- and obviously, some B2B as well there. 
Matt Parson: And then size wise, I think it was the second part of your question. It spans the spectrum honestly. I mean we're still being seeing a lot of success in the SMB space and then also still having great success at the very large and as we've said multiple times, we're continuing to focus on both of them. And we've got teams internally that are focused on both the SMB space as well as large enterprise space. And so the success we've seen so far this year on the signing side really spanning the spectrum of small to large. 
Operator: The next question is from the line of John Davis with Raymond James. 
John Davis: I just want to start talking a little bit about inflation and what kind of lag, obviously, when you're -- some of your costs and interchange in basis points, do you have to give 30, 60, 90 days' notice to raise price on a per transaction basis? Just trying to understand, I think when we talked in the IPO, the thought was that inflation would be relatively flat minus some timing differences as far as the impact on your P&L. So just curious kind of what that timing delay looks like for your ability to raise price to offset inflation. 
Dushyant Sharma: We are actually very surgical in how we are approaching our clients because these are long-term relationship, long-term partnerships, we view our clients and our partners and many of these clients have been with us for a long period of time. So from that perspective, we are always looking at -- contractually, we have -- at the time you talked about, the 60, 90 days is pretty much the top end of the time it takes us to make the changes from a contractual standpoint, but we are being very surgical as to how we talk to our clients about it.
 And what we are seeing is clients are very empathetic and very understanding because they're dealing with this, not just with us, but the whole economy is right now dealing with this. So we generally have a better traction than typical that would be the case. But your assumption is correct that we do have ability to make changes, and it does take 60, 90 days. 
John Davis: And then I just want to touch on profitability. Obviously, some near-term headwinds from the push out and then kind of wage inflation. I wanted just on, maybe for a minute, talk a little bit about longer-term profitability. If you go back pre-IPO, this is a mid-20s EBITDA margin business. And maybe just talk about the ramp back to that, how you think about profitability over the kind of the medium to long term. 
Dushyant Sharma: I think that's our -- that remains our goal, and I'll let Matt jump in as well, but that remains our goal. And what we are seeing is, right now, the tremendous momentum in the market. So we're trying to take a look at, can we lean in even more from a sales and marketing perspective to go in more aggressive to continue to accelerate the growth here. So we'll continue to look at that. But our long-term perspective is in coming years is to be in that EBITDA margin profile.
 Matt, do you want to add anything. 
Matt Parson: Yes. I don't -- I wouldn't say there's been any change in kind of our mantra around how we think about growth and profitability and ultimately, what we want to achieve on that front. We obviously are a little bit under where we'd like to be for this year, given the things we talked about in the prepared remarks. But our overall kind of philosophy and medium- and long-term view in mantra is still the same as it was. And there continues to be leverage in the business.
 I think it's -- to Dushyant's point, continual reevaluation of the management team of the trade-off between growth and profitability and making sure that we're not constraining future growth simply because of an extra -- the cost of an extra point, couple points of profitability. So -- but I think just to sum it up, nothing has changed in kind of our medium- to long-term view or mantra world fundamentally in the business. I mean the business is still strong as evidenced by the signings. And so we're still executing accordingly. 
Operator: The next question is from the line of Jeff Cantwell with Wells Fargo. 
Jeffrey Cantwell: I wanted to circle back on the pushback and the timing that you're talking about in the 2023 because I can already hear the follow-up question that we'll be answering for the next few months until we speak again, which is was this an isolated incident?
 And I guess I'd have to kind of phrase it that way because the question would then be, why would there not be others. And so we have to try to work our way through that. So I was curious if you can give us a little more detail on and just get a little comfort around what you're discussing as far as pushing back revenue in 2023. 
Dushyant Sharma: Thank you, Jeff. Look, first of all, I think -- first of all, very, very good question, very reasonable question and very understandable. And let me just talk about from the -- from 2 perspectives. One is the economic climate itself you're dealing with. The overall the sentiment is the clients are just taking a little bit longer than they usually do to get live on our platform. I mean historically speaking, we are implementation machine actually.
 I mean we do a great job. We get customers live. And that is in our platform, our capabilities are better today at getting customers live than they have ever been. And the reason for that is the investments we have been making over the years. The challenge is that the readiness of the client to just whatever little support, which is a fractional support relative to the other efforts, which are required to get them launched. That fractional support is required by clients getting their technology team engaged. There are some IT resources to just QA that test the platform and so on.
 And because of the environment we are in, it is stretching a little bit. But I want to tie it back to the guidance and this year, if all of that aside is a couple of declines we're talking about, they would have actually maintained their time line. We would be perfectly fine with our guide, as I shared earlier. So it's an interesting scenario meaning that couple of clients made an impact, which we were counting on for this year. But other delays, some of them were actually -- we were already factoring in. 
Matt Parson: Yes. I think Dushyant is an right and I'll just add, of course, that our planning modeling as we go through it, we don't assume best case scenario for client go live. We, of course, look at history and assume some amount of buffer on when they would go live typically, depending on the size of the client and various things as you would expect. I think the challenge with these 2 in particular were they were very large that we referenced on the call.
 The 2 we referred on the call was very large and kind of hit at the same time. And so I think as we look into the rest of the year, we've -- in our guidance, we've assumed appropriate, again or what we think is appropriate levels of buffer and delay. And these are 2 of the biggest ones that were kind of slated for the back half of the year. So yes, I think we -- as I said on the call, we fully expect that we'll land within the revised range.
 But actually, to Andrew's point earlier on that question earlier, I just do want to say Jeff to you and others that the demand for the product remains very strong because it is -- the markets we are in are actually the right conditions for a platform like ours. However, once the business executives make the decision to get it launched, they still need a support from their IT partners and other priorities which might be going on. And some of them are right now stretched just because of the climate we are in. 
Jeffrey Cantwell: And if I can ask one follow-up. On the financial outlook for this year, I'd like to ask this question, but I guess it depends on how to level set expectations for going forward. What would be the factors in your own minds right now that would drive revenue, for example, to the lower end of the range? And what would be the factors that would drive it to the upper end of the range? I just want to make sure we're all clear on that. Same with contribution profit. I'm just trying to get a feel of what you think are the swing factors in your guidance as it stands right now. 
Dushyant Sharma: I think there are 2 or 3 and all of them we have talked about, I mean client go-lives. If they all go live as we are planning to and if they -- and some of the inflationary environment that we are operating in and if our assumptions hold true in terms of being able to make adjustments and which we have been making. Then I think we'll be at the top end and if they don't then we'll be closer to the bottom line. 
Matt Parson: Yes, I agree that. I think that's the 2 main factors as we kind of think about the ranges, timing of go lives, implementation go lives and our continued ability to improve the pricing profile in certain situations based on what we're seeing with inflation. 
Operator: The next question is from the line of Dave Koning with Baird. 
David Koning: And maybe I can ask a numbers question. Just if -- I think you said that you expected these clients have delayed to be about 4% of this year, and they were going to come out in Q3. Does that mean that they collectively are about 8% of total revenue? And I guess the corollary to that is if your wound rates are still the same, does that mean next year will be an outsized good growth year, just you'll get the full impact of this plus just the normal wins coming on? 
Matt Parson: Yes. Thanks, Dave. So on the first question, it was 400 basis points on our then revenue growth rate, i.e., Q3 of last year. So just to make sure the multiplier is the right number but your concept is correct. The other client was not quite as large, but it was in that same ballpark. And it was 400 basis points on then revenue growth rate at that point last year.
 So I think that also raises another good point, which is we -- because of the other momentum we've seen in the business, if you sort of do the math on what our previous guide was versus what this guide is when you take the numbers that I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've also -- there's also been some good things that have happened that have helped offset some of these negatives during the year as well. It's not just a one-way kind of move. There's definitely been some other positives that have helped offset the negatives.
 On next year, I think we'll see. We'll give our next year guidance when the time is appropriate. I think as we said, they are pushing in 2023 and the revenue is not lost. So to your point, we do expect them to come live and start getting that revenue in '23. It would have -- from a raw dollar perspective, it would have already been in the number anyway, had it gone live later this year. So it's not necessarily new revenue into 2023. But to your point, on a percentage basis, it has an impact there.
 So we will -- like I said, we'll give our 2023 guidance at the times appropriate, but I think the way you're thinking about it is in the right direction. 
David Koning: And then the second one, I think this was very, very clear, but I think inflation, basically, you're saying has 2 impacts. One is just wages to the expenses. But 2 is inflation has a network fee impact that hurts the contribution profit, right, because you pay a higher volume to pay network fees. Those are the 2 main things, right? 
Dushyant Sharma: That's correct. That's correct. And as we shared earlier, one of which the -- our contracts already allow us to talk to our clients and discuss and partner with our clients to solve for that, which, as Matt mentioned, we are already in the process in some cases already. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] There are no additional questions at this time. I will pass it back to the management team for closing remarks. 
Dushyant Sharma: Thank you so much. Really appreciate your time. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter, and have a great summer. 
Operator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-05-05 17:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the FLEETCOR First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to your speaker today, Mr. Ron Clarke. Please go ahead. 
James Eglseder: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our first quarter 2022 earnings call. With me today are Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO; and Charles Freund, our CFO. Following the prepared comments, the operator will announce that the queue will open for the Q&A session. It is only then that you can get in line for questions. Please note, our earnings release and supplement can be found under the Investor Relations section of our website at fleetcor.com.
 Throughout this call, we will be covering organic revenue growth. As a reminder, this metric neutralizes the impact of year-over-year changes of foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and fuel spreads. It also includes pro forma results for acquisitions closed during the 2 years being compared.
 We will also be covering non-GAAP financial metrics, including revenues, net income and net income per diluted share, all on an adjusted basis. These measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than in other companies.
 Reconciliations of the historical non-GAAP to the most directly comparable GAAP information can be found in today's press release and on our website.
 I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today may include forward-looking statements. These statements reflect the best information we have as of today. All statements about our outlook, new products and expectations regarding business development and future acquisitions are based on that information.

 Now with that out of the way, I will turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay, Jim. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q1 2022 earnings call. Upfront here, I'll plan to cover 4 subjects: so first, give you my take on Q1; second, lay out our updated rest of year 2022 guidance; third, and I'll give you a brief update on our Russia business; and then lastly, I'll share some new things, some good things happening in the company.
 Okay. Let me make the turn to our Q1 results. Terrific. Really, really great performance. We reported revenue of $789 million, up 30%, and cash EPS of $365 million, up 29%.
 Revenue came in very strong, about $40 million above our Q1 midpoint guide, with only $12 million of that beat macro-related. So a lot of very good fundamental overperformance in the quarter.
 Organic growth overall, 15% for Q1, and each of our 4 major lines of business, all growing organically double-digits. Trends in Q1, excellent. Sales, up 39% versus last year. We added about 50,000 new clients to the fold, sold in Q1, and over 50% of all of our new global fuel card clients came to us digitally. So a terrific sales quarter.
 A steady revenue retention of 93% and healthy same-store sales for the quarter at plus 7%. So Q1, really one of the best quarterly performances that I can recall.
 All right. Let me shift to our updated rest of year 2022 guidance. So first off, we're expecting a bit of a mixed macro rest of year. So on the positive side, our clients are healthier, spending more, which we can see in the volumes. Fuel prices are at record levels. And the Brazil currency has rebounded some since the start of the year.
 On the not-so-good side, we're outlooking higher interest expense, really depending on the pace of the rate hikes and likely higher bad debt expense. The real wildcard, we think, for rest of year is the Brazil FX, as it's continued to be quite volatile year-to-date.
 Fortunately, we're enjoying pretty strong fundamentals exiting Q1. We've got healthy volumes. We've got record sales. We've got steady retention, so all the things that set up well for us for the rest of year.
 So with that, we're revising our 2022 full year guidance today up as follows. So revenue to $3.360 billion at the midpoint. That's up $140 million. And cash EPS of $15.60. That's up $0.35 from our initial guide. So a much stronger full year 2022 outlook today than we had 90 days ago.
 Assuming we achieve today's guidance, it would imply full year '22 revenue growth of 19% and full year '22 cash EPS growth of 18%. So that would be back-to-back years post-COVID, 2021 and 2022, in which FLEETCOR would compound earnings by 18%.
 I do want to remind everyone, we are outlooking still meaningful sequential improvement in the guide as we run through the year, with our Q4 revenue expected to be up about $90 million versus our Q1 print.
 Okay. Let me shift gears and give you just a brief update on our Russia business. So I'll start by reminding you that Russia represents a very small part of the company, about 3% of revenue. So on a 2022 annualized basis, Russia will contribute about $85 million in revenue and approximately $0.77 in cash EPS.
 The Russia business is really a pure fleet card business. It runs very stand-alone. And we employ about 600 local employees. As you can imagine, we've been quite busy since the start of the conflict. We've been taking actions to derisk the business. We've been complying with the ever-evolving sanctions. And we've continued to weigh the various options that we have.
 We're certainly being super cautious to take care of the well-being of our employees. So look, we'll continue to keep you updated as the situation evolves.
 Okay. So last up today, I would like to run through some good things that are happening in the company. So first, some new wins. So we've got a fair number of notable new wins and client renewals in the quarter. So just a couple of examples. Speedway, one of our largest North America retail partners, recently extended their relationship with us, delighted with that.
 Amazon awarded us their middle-mile trucking fleet, which has grown like a weed. We won the Eclipx fleet leasing business contract in Australia, a pretty big piece of business for us in the region.
 Second, cross-sell, we really like the cross-sell opportunity in front of us. We're still exploring selling our Corporate Payment products into our fuel card base. And we're progressing selling our add-ons to our toll customers. You've heard us talk about selling fueling. We're also testing now selling insurance and even lodging. We did reach 1.7 million add-on fueling transactions in the quarter to our total customer base, so progressing quite well.
 Third, EV, we're going on offense. We've talked previously about building capabilities to serve our fleet use case and protect the customers we have and the revenue we have. We've now identified a couple of new customer segments that we can repurpose, we think, our EV assets, like our network too, and generate incremental revenue beyond the fleet business. So potentially here, some incremental revenue upside to the energy transition.
 And lastly, we had our off-site, growth off-site meeting, last month and set the internal goal of selling 1 billion of new business annually within the forecast period. So pretty excited to aspire to $1 billion in new business. We've concluded we have the product set now and the TAM to do it, and we think we've built the marketing, credit and digital underlying capabilities to do it. So super excited about chasing a bigger number.
 So look, taken together, new wins, cross-sell opportunities, EV on offense and selling more, pretty exciting for us.
 So look, in conclusion, today, just a few final thoughts. So one, our Q1 results were terrific, clearly better than we had expected. Our rest of year or full year 2022 performance, expected to be much better than we envisioned 90 days ago, and lots of good things, new things happening in the company. So all in all, we're in a pretty good place. So with that, let me turn the call back over to Chuck to provide some additional details on the quarter. Chuck? 
Charles Freund: Yes. Thanks, Ron. So before digging into the financial results, I would like to make sure that you were all aware of the new investor deck we posted on our website a few weeks ago. In there, we tried to simplify how we talk about the company.
 At its core, FLEETCOR provides a set of corporate payment solutions to help businesses reduce spend. Now we do it in 2 ways, one, by enabling and controlling what's purchased. We call this expense management, and it comes in a few flavors, like fuel, tolls and lodging.
 Or two, by enabling controls after the purchase, but before the payments have been made. We call this AP payments, where we provide the options businesses have to make their payments, such as online bill pay, full AP outsourcing, virtual cards and cross-border. So when you think of it this way, the company really does only 2 things, expense management and AP payments in a couple different ways.
 So with that context, let's look at some more detail on the quarter. As Ron mentioned, we posted an impressive 30% growth quarter, including 15% organic growth, which I'll get into in more detail in a moment. About 10% or $58 million of the growth was due to acquisitions we made last year, and about 3% or $21 million came from macro tailwinds.
 Speaking of macro, fuel prices were $3.88 per gallon for the quarter, higher than our $3.40 guidance assumption based on January levels. Higher fuel prices contributed about $22 million of additional revenues versus prior year.
 Now we exited the quarter with fuel prices at around $4.50 per gallon.  We do think this will moderate some over the balance of the year. Fuel spreads in the quarter had a positive impact of about $5 million. And we had a $6 million negative impact due to lower foreign exchange rates as unfavorable movements in European currencies, which affect our cross-border and fuel business, more than offset the strength of the Brazilian reals that helps our toll revenue.
 Now moving to organic growth, starting with AP payments. Our corporate payables were up 23%, and that was led by full AP outsourcing, which was up over 50% yet again driven by continuing strong new sales. Cross-border was up 17%, and that's normalized for the AFEX acquisition. The cross-border team had a great quarter as new sales remained strong and activity recovered in Australia.
 And moving on to our expense management solutions. Fuel was up organically, 14%, as new sales growth of 25% and higher same-store sales of 3% to 4% continued to drive the performance. I may sound like a broken record on this, but we continue to see fantastic results from our digital marketing and customer acquisition efforts across this business.
 Tolls were up 18% compared with last year as the business just continues to perform. New sales are solid and retention initiatives are showing to be quite effective as we highlight the differentiated value proposition we offer versus our competitors.
 Lodging continued to perform well too, up 22%. Our workforce lodging business has improved with higher new sales and better volumes. Airlines again outperformed, with organic growth over 65%. In the quarter, we did announce the purchase of Levarti, an airline software platform company. The deal is immaterial to our financials, but we believe the software, combined with our lodging solution, will drive more sales in the airline vertical.
 Now looking further down the income statement. Operating expenses of $472 million represented a 38% increase over prior year primarily due to the addition of the AFEX and ALE operations, increases tied to higher volumes across our businesses, incremental bad debt, stock compensation and new sales generation activities and investments to drive future growth.
 Bad debt expense was $25.5 million or 6 basis points as bad debt levels have returned to more historical levels as customer spend increases with higher fuel prices and as a result of much stronger new sales, which tend to have a higher loss rate.
 The EBITDA margin in the quarter was 50% as higher stock comp and bad debt expenses negatively impacted the margin. This was largely expected as the company took actions to stimulate growth coming out of the COVID environment. We still expect our full year EBITDA margin to be in line with our original expectations of 52% as margins expand throughout the year, along with revenue growth and the increased benefit of synergy realization from acquisitions.
 Interest expense decreased 23% year-over-year driven by the effect of a $1 billion fixed rate swap that matured in January and the benefit of higher interest income earned on customer deposits and cash balances in certain foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26% versus 22% last year, with the increase driven primarily by less excess tax benefit on stock option exercises and higher interest income on foreign deposits, which are taxed at a higher rate.
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with over $1.3 billion in unrestricted cash. And we had $969 million available on our revolver. There was $4.9 billion outstanding on our credit facilities. And we had $1.4 billion borrowed in our securitization facility.
 As of March 31, our leverage ratio was 2.72x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement.
 In the quarter, we upsized our securitization facility to $1.6 billion in order to accommodate higher receivables balances due to higher fuel prices. We intend to maximize the use of the facility given that it is the lowest cost of capital funding instrument that we have.
 We repurchased roughly 1.8 million shares, 1.1 million of which were completed under our 10b5 plan that we had in place in January, and which were included in our original guidance. We still have $1.23 billion authorized for repurchase. And we believe we have ample liquidity to pursue any near-term M&A opportunities and continue to buy back shares when it makes sense.
 Ron has covered our full year guidance updates. So now, let me share some thoughts on our Q2 outlook and our assumptions.
 For Q2, we're expecting revenue to be between $805 million and $825 million and adjusted net income per share to be between $3.80 and $3.90, which, at the midpoint, is approximately $0.70 or 22% higher than what we reported in Q2 of 2021.
 Regarding our guidance assumptions, we are using $3.90 as our fuel price assumption for the rest of the year. This reflects fuel prices of $4.25, $3.85 and $3.65 for the next 3 quarters, respectively. Clearly, we don't expect fuel prices to remain at the current elevated levels, so we're using this forward curve as the basis of our forecast.
 Our interest expense guidance of $105 million to $115 million is based off of a LIBOR average of 154 basis points for April through December. Our original assumption had LIBOR of 54 basis points for that same period. The rest of our assumptions can be found in our press release and supplement.
 I would note that our rest of year guidance expectations do still include revenue and adjusted earnings per share from our fuel business in Russia, which are $67 million and $0.63, respectively, for the remainder of the year.
 Moving away from the results and outlook, I would like to thank our circa 10,000 employees around the world who helped us deliver a fantastic start to 2022 and who will be the driving force as we continue to grow our company. Thank you for your interest in FLEETCOR.
 And now, operator, we'll open the line for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: It's nice to speak to you guys, and the results look really great here. I'll ask maybe, I think, Ron, you talked about the guidance change, and it looks like it's well above the beat, both macro and fundamentally as well. So is there a way to maybe break that up for us just to better understand what the $140 million, whatever the revision is, for the full year, how much of that is macro, fuel, et cetera, versus underlying performance being better? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Hey, Tien-Tsin, good to hear your voice, too. So simplistically, the $140 million would be $40 million in Q1, $100 million rest of year and called out: 1/3, real performance; 2/3, macro health. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Got it. And then from a new sales perspective, I think you said up 39%. I know you've always stressed to us the importance of driving new sales. How about for the rest of the year? Have you sort of upgraded your thinking on sales productivity and targets? I heard the billion comment earlier, but just thinking about the next 2 to 3 quarters, have you changed your thinking [ on that basis ]? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, really good question. So yes, particularly on the fuel, fleet side. And the thing that's interesting is that you think the higher fuel prices obviously help us from a revenue perspective, right, in terms of MDR, but they actually help in sales. So literally, there was a period the digital guys came down and we had said that, I think it was in March, the volumes, the search volumes were running about 2x kind of our normalized level of kind of inbound. So our sales in that business were super good in Q1, and we had taken up the forecast rest of year.
 So again, I said it repeatedly, it's the single best indicator, [ tension ] for the business, right? If we can grow compound sales somewhere in the 20s, right, when we're trying to compound revenue double-digit, obviously, that improves, right? If we get to that number and don't have COVID again, obviously, the revenue will accelerate. 
Operator: Your next question is from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. 
Jeffrey Goldstein: This is Jeff Goldstein on for James. You were talking about, in your prepared remarks, about possibly seeing revenue upside to energy transition given repurposing some of your EV assets. Can you just expand on that a little and talk about what needs to go right for you to actually see that revenue upside from the ongoing transition? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Hey, Jeff, it's Ron. So I don't want to give too much away, but I would say there was an a-ha moment where we were taking stock of the assets that we're building, particularly the ability to capture, right, the EV data and then the network, the public network, getting acceptance, and the ability to settle there.
 And up until very recently, our whole focus has been, hey, serving basically our card fleet customers or prospective fleet customers with this. And all of a sudden, 2 or 3 other interesting customer segments liked what we have. And so that's the headline. They're non-fleet kinds of customers that need help in EV. And so the assets that we built for one purpose, we think, are pretty transferable to the other.
 And then, b, we've actually got a pretty interesting target sitting in our M&A pipeline that would be supportive of that, that would accelerate our move there. So the real headline is we've just opened our eyes to how to basically serve a greater set of people in the ecosystem and hopefully generate incremental revenue. 
Jeffrey Goldstein: Got it. That's helpful. And then I wanted to ask about the competitive landscape within Corporate Payments. How are you thinking about competition and investment in that space just given the range of new competitors increasingly attacking that opportunity set? Just anything in particular to call out there. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean the headline on that one is it's just so nascent. I know that you guys have some theme of, hey, the disruptor theory and there's lots of new people doing lots of new things, which is true. But I try to remind people, Jeff, that's us. We're the new guys that have less than 1% of that TAM. And it's fundamentally the banks that have most of what we call the Corporate Payments business.
 So it is a -- it's a massive set of payables basically to get digitized, and it's held adversely with the banks. And so it's, I think, it's a food frenzy really for all of us that are bringing something new, and I'm hopeful the other guys that are new can get something, too. But the real competition for us is the -- are the current people, the current providers. So it's super wide open for us. 
Operator: Your next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: I know, Ron, you mentioned there's a number of ways Russia can go.  What's the likelihood we see a meaningful negative hit from that region, whether it's related to sort of discontinuing operations or other macro-specific factors in the country? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Hey, Sanjay, it's Ron. I would say really uncertain, right, how that ball is going to bounce. We're doing lots of things, as you can imagine, exploring everything, right, selling it, transferring it, doing all kinds of things. So ballpark, I think we're carrying circa around $300 million on our books. So to the extent that the thing were shuttered and there was now complete loss, that's kind of ballparking what the number is.
 So look, I don't know where it's going to go. We've obviously got some ideas of how we're running the thing differently and cutting ties obviously with the business a bit back here to the mother ship. And so it's really more of a wait and see. We're going to obviously continue to explore whether there's buyers that are interested in the business and honestly, just see how the conflict steps along here. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Okay. Great. And I can't help but not ask the M&A question, just because valuations have come in so significantly. I mean how do you feel about the backdrop now? And what's really interesting in terms of areas you would want to add to? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I think it's mixed, is what I would say. Obviously, we're always working a pipeline, no different today. We've got 3 or 4 things. And I would say, as I run through those, some of them are later-stage. Some of the sellers haven't moved a lot. We point out, [ hey, you watching ] like even today some of the comp groups.
 And so I would say some people are just, I think, kind of staying put, maybe going to wait to see if things come back. And then I would say, [ there's ] a couple of newer things that we've negotiated, let's say, in the last couple of months. We've been able to agree to prices that we like, that work for us. So I would say, it's interesting, but it's kind of mixed. Not everybody has reset, but I think some people have. 
Operator: Your next question is from Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays. 
Ramsey El-Assal: I wanted to ask just a general question about Corporate Payments. It came in a lot higher than our number and I think The Street number as well. What kind of outperformed in the quarter even versus your own expectations? What do you see in that business as just really working right now? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Hey, Ramsey, it's Ron. I would say everything in there worked. The sales were good. We did get a bit of recovery in the base in that business. We talked about some of the clients getting healthier. And for sure, I don't know if we called it out before, but we have a bit of a, what we call, a multi-card business in there that's not only purchasing, but it does pick up some travel. So like others, we got some decent amount of add-back.
 The full AP thing is warring, was still 50%-plus up in the quarter. And despite eating a giant cross-border business, not that long ago, the cross-border business was also better than we thought. Mostly Australia, so that business originates really in 4 markets for us, but one of which is Australia. And it was, when I say in the ditch, I mean, it was super in the ditch in '21.
 So it's really, I would say, some fair amount of underlying health in Australia cross-border, in the multi-card business and then really just, again, super-duper sales. So kind of all working there. 
Ramsey El-Assal: All working. Okay. And I wanted to ask you too about your comment on the EV strategy and sort of going on the offensive there. This is a bit of a nuance, but I think it's important. Is this sort of in response to what you're seeing in the marketplace in terms of fleet starting to shift in this direction?
 Or is this more you're seizing an opportunity because you see well the opportunity to kind of shape the market and create a customer and drive revenue in a new way in a market that looks like it's about to sort of evolve in the right direction? Is it kind of reactive or the opposite, is kind of -- is the question? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I think it's b, it's the opportunity side. Look, it's still super-duper early days, as you guys know. I think it's just one of those a-ha things, where you look at everything we've been doing for a couple of years. We've made a bunch of investments. We've reworked our system so that they can combine EV and combustion. And we've worked on network-building and contracts and all those kind of stuff.
 So we're doing all this stuff, right, in preparation of serving our clients. And then kind of out of the woodwork, a couple of non-fleet customers kind of poke their heads up and go, "Hey, we need help on this stuff." We're like, wait a minute here, why are we just trying to make a good fleet transition, why don't we take advantage of the new needs that are being created given we have these new assets and stuff?
 So I think it was, honestly, like shame on me, shame on us. It was a bit of a-ha moment. But as I mentioned, we've also got a deal once we had that idea a few months ago. We've found someone that's been chasing that a bit, too. And so it's a super-duper way of hedging however this goes, right?
 If it goes slow, which is my bet, hey, so go slow. If it goes faster, we could have something that actually goes up. In the event that our other thing ticks down, which, again, we don't think much early days, but instead of people calling in, hey, look, it's sad times for fleet. Or maybe they go, holy moly, they're going to hold on to most or all of their fleet business and they're going to be beneficiaries of something new because of what they built. So maybe people are like, wow, are you saying it could be literally a net positive?
 Yes. That's what I'm trying say today is. And we're obviously going to provide way more info here when it's appropriate of who those customers are and what we're going to do and why it can be upside. But I'm telling you, we're super excited about it. 
Ramsey El-Assal: That's great. So still quite early days, but you're laying the groundwork for whichever way it goes. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. And we're hearing from the people. I mean the other thing I want to make out is this isn't just Ron Clarke's brain turning alone in the night. There's actual prospective customers out there talking to us and taking on some of these things. So it's real, which is the other thing I want to make sure you hear. 
Operator: Your next question is from Andrew Jeffrey of Truist Securities. 
Gus Galá: It's Gus stepping on for Andrew. Just as we look at the cycle and you're kind of starting to see rising bad debt expense, is that safe to assume you reflect some late fees and overdue balances? And you commented that, that kind of happens with the higher new sales. Are you seeing the bad debt expense go up because of the existing client base as well? Just parsing that out would be very helpful. 
Charles Freund: Yes. This is Charles. So yes, bad debt came in higher, and part of that is due to fuel prices, right? So you have higher fuel prices equal higher customer balances. If they default, that's unfortunate.
 And then, yes, new sales tend to default at a much higher rate, right? So once we underwrite someone, if they stick with us for a couple of years, they tend to be okay. The first year though, we do see higher losses. So record sales last year and continued record sales in Q1 of this year are driving some of that.
 We do think as fuel prices will normalize throughout the course of the year, that bad debt will also normalize a bit down. But for this quarter, at $25.5 million, it came in a little hot. 
Gus Galá: Okay. Helpful. And following up, I want to ask about the efforts to drive sales force productivity and where we are in terms of the glide path of driving cross-sell Corpay into fuel. 
Ronald F. Clarke: What was the first part? I missed the first part of the question. Can you just repeat the question again? I missed the first part of it. 
Gus Galá: Yes, sorry. I just wanted to ask you guys to talk a little bit about sales force productivity and kind of where we are in the glide path of driving cross-sell Corpay into fleet. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Got it. So let me take the first part first, which is just sales productivity. It's numbers 1, 2 and 3 on my list and our list, right? The more we can sell from an absolute perspective and the more efficiently we can sell it obviously leads to profitable sales, profitable business. So it's a huge focus.
 I would say the 2 things that really help our aging, right, of our people-based assets, so as we have people in seats and people in territories long, they get more productive. So we've made huge strides with increasing the headcount in the last couple of years. So now, we're getting some benefit basically from that aging of the people side.
 And then on the digital side, it's a bit of a breeder reactor, right? The bigger the business gets, the smarter we get of how to match and who to put at in front of and how to bid and everything else. And so that business keeps getting better basically. We keep getting more effective at it because we keep getting smarter. As well, as you know, the Googles and stuff, index people that have successful things. So to the extent that we get better our organic portion or free portion, the digital selling gets higher.
 And so all of that, other than the inflation of people bidding more, is super positive. So not only are we in record production-of-sales land, we're also in a super attractive cost of sales as well.
 On the second part of the question, the Corpay cross-sell, I think I mentioned it in the last 90 days, we kind of paused selling the Corpay payable solution until we put the platform in. So what we started out doing, when we put the first couple thousand accounts, is we went to a Ron Clarke fuel card guy and said, "Hey, we're giving you a new way to pay us, pay your bill to us. And here it is. Oh, you like it. And oh, by the way, you can pay some other bills."
 And we found out it was maybe a bit too much, hey, you're moving my cheese and now I pay the bills, now you're pitching me something else. And so we decided basically to do the first thing, put the platform in, make sure people are comfortable being able to pay us on this new platform, and then go back, which we plan to do in this quarter, in Q2. So I'm hoping to have a better update for you in terms of demand and stuff when we speak next time. 
Operator: Your next question is from Mihir Bhatia of Bank of America. 
Mihir Bhatia: And maybe I'll just start with on the fuel -- in the fuel card and fleet business. Can you talk a little bit about just April trends? Obviously, there's been some chatter around freight recession and things like that. But what are you seeing in terms of freight miles driven? Are those holding up nicely? Any commentary about just what April looked like? 
Charles Freund: Yes. This is Charles. So in our over-the-road business, which would deal with big trucking, like you mentioned, we see a little bit of softness in that business. When I say a little bit of, in single -- low single digits. But it's -- what we hear is related to both driver shortages as well as now, the supply chain issues, some truck and/or trailer shortages. So yes, a little bit of softness there, but nothing material. 
Mihir Bhatia: Got it. Okay. And then just in terms of -- I wanted to go back to your comments just about the guidance increasing. And I think if I followed it right, the fundamental improvement in the guide is, other than the first quarter beat, obviously, and excluding the macro and fuel, is like, what, [ $20 million, $25 million ].
 Are there particular segments that are driving that increase in terms of your expectations that maybe just growing -- grew faster than you had expected? Or do you think that they are going to be growing faster than you did at the start of the year? 
Charles Freund: Okay. Sure. So obviously, the benefit from the fuel pricing side, so most of the macro, you would see there. And also, in terms of the comeback in terms of COVID, we've seen a lot of that in the lodging space, which we expect will continue as pent-up demand for travel will help our airline lodging business. So we have a lot of sequential improvement expected in that business in particular. 
Mihir Bhatia: Okay. And then just my last question. Just in terms of -- you mentioned sales force productivity or the inquiries increasing because of higher fuel prices. But just can you talk a little bit about just how you're managing the credit side of that, right?
 I mean some of the folks probably are coming to you just because of the stretch, they might have used up their other existing line on their other card or whatever method they use to pay, just looking to increase their available to borrow. So just can you talk about how you're managing the credit side of that? 
Charles Freund: Yes. So we are taking a look at policies and such. Generally, we'll underwrite to a full amount. And then as prices go up, folks will come and ask for increases in what we underwrite them. When we're underwriting someone new, we're looking at an amount, and if we can't cover all their volume, we do lose a bit of share of wallet in that regard.
 So we do watch it closely. It is an area where you can quite quickly monitor spending levels and such. So we get a good sense when someone comes on, are they good, are they performing, their fuel volumes tend to be pretty stable. And so as long as they're with us for a while, we'll feel more comfortable to kind of ride the prices up with them. But for new clients, it's pretty strict straight off the bat. There's an amount, if I can cover what you've got, great; if I can't, then we will have to share the wallet stuff in the early days. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Hey, it's Ron. Let me just add on one other trick that works in the fuel card business, which is we change the payment cycle. So to your point, if we're getting a lot of digital stuff and it's not screening out as well, our approval rates aren't as good, one of the things we can do is effectively, like in trucking, move it to daily, daily, or in a local business, move it to weekly, weekly, net-5.
 So because of the turn in that kind of business and the usage and stuff, we do have a fair number of clients that are [ unsure of ] payment terms. So obviously, that's a way to Chuck's point, to still basically bring on customers but basically minimize, if you will, to limit the losses that we could incur. 
Charles Freund: In certain segments, where we don't feel comfortable, we'll push in the prepaid. 
Operator: Your next question is from Jeff Cantwell of Wells Fargo. 
Jeffrey Cantwell: Maybe could you dig in somewhere in the cross-sell, meaning you were sort of talking about this earlier, but where are those opportunities developing, why are they developing? And maybe could you segment those out [ where I can ] dimensionalize them?
 [ I think I feel like a ] goal would be to have some sort of framework for thinking about how cross-sell revenue fits into our model. So I just want to see if we can think about cross-sell appropriately as it certainly seems like a nice opportunity for you. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I'm not sure, this is Ron, by the way, I catch the thing that you're saying, hey, how do we as a company think about and measure the cross-sell opportunity. I think we kind of run through it that we go area by area. So in fuel cards, our idea is Corporate Payments, so we sell companion cards in there. We're selling bill pay in there. In our toll business, I mentioned before, we're selling fueling. I mentioned we sold -- generated 1.7 million transactions in the quarter. We're now starting to sell insurance.
 In our lodging business, obviously, we've added cards that allow the same client that buys lodging to buy air or other kinds of travel. It's not lodging. And so in every -- virtually in every business we have, because we've gotten bigger and we have more products now, we're taking those related products back to the group that we have. And I guess, we could report out, Jim, if it's interesting, kind of what those sales or revenues add up to, where people are interested.
 But I would say we're making pretty good progress on most of them. I did say we paused the Corpay payables one to get people on the platform first. But look, we have 800,000 customers now spending hundreds of millions with us, so obviously -- hundreds of billions. So we got plenty of opportunity to sell products back. 
Jeffrey Cantwell: Okay. That's great color. And then might I ask if you could do the same for your new wins, how many new card wins did you see you had this quarter? And could you provide any color on what you think is driving them?
 I guess if you think back to the last year, the year before, does anything stand out about now, about why you're winning versus previously? Just curious if you could give us some color. And I guess, the follow-up would be, are they sizable? Any sort of dimensions to that would be great as well. 
Charles Freund: Yes. This is Charles. So I think you're on the new client wins. I think Ron mentioned we had 50,000 in the quarter, new clients. A lot of them tend to be small, digitally acquired, a lot of them in our fuel base. When we get to the Corporate Payments arena, we do sell more in the mid-market, so as they are larger clients and such. So it does really depend on the business that you're in. In Brazil, we sell, lots of consumers, tags and such. So it depends.
 We are still in the main, selling individual products to a prospect. We're not really bundling yet. And that's one of the big opportunities, that Ron was mentioning it before, as around the platform.
 So as we build out the platform, and it has multiple products in it, once we sell it in, then people can then turn on that additional functionality. But we haven't been doing that as of late. So a lot of the new wins that you're seeing is really a function of just better sales performance and a lot coming through digital channels. 
Jeffrey Cantwell: Okay. And congrats on the results. 
Operator: Your next question is from Pete Christiansen of Citi. 
Peter Christiansen: I wanted to ask, Ron, you called out some really nice wins in the fuel card space here, some large deals. Just wondering if you could provide some color on how you're seeing RFP activity these days, maybe looking out the next quarter or so, looking for large deals. Are you seeing healthy activity in that area? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I don't think it's anything, Pete, out of the ordinary. I would say, in the larger accounts, which we call out because we had 50,000 new accounts, that -- [ with our Board to take the rest of the call ] to run through those names. I would say that enterprise and partners, they run on cycles, they're under contract with us or someone else, and they come up.
 And so no, no super change, I think, in that rate. I do think there's some kind of newish or different kinds of stuff, like that Amazon thing that I mentioned, so there's some different kinds of players a bit, the same a little bit on the EV side. So that would be the one difference. I think some of the new business that's out there is just a little bit different in terms of the type of business it is. 
Peter Christiansen: Interesting. And then I was just curious how you're thinking about utilizing some of the macro upside that you've been enjoying. Obviously, you're getting a lot more inbound activity with higher fuel prices, just in general. But in terms of dedicating more spend, variable spend to digital marketing, things like that, versus perhaps letting some of that flow to the bottom line, just wondering if your calculus has changed there, if you're thinking about anything differently at this juncture. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, that's a good question. So I would say not a lot. So a couple of reasons. One is we already fed the army here a bit, if you will. I think we said at the beginning that we gave -- because we could get a profit target this year, more expense growth than normal, particularly in sales and IT, so one, I think our initial guide [ and other guides still a ] decent amount in it.
 Two is I don't love the uncertainty of 2/3 of the upside being the planet. The planet can shift around and refactor on us some. And so I don't like to spend money that I can 100% count on, so that would be number two. But with that, I would say you hit the one area.
 If there was one area where we would and do plan to spend a bit more, it would be in digital selling. And the reason is, you can. Unlike some of the other things that take way longer to build, right, and prepare and to get into the market, the head digital guy can walk down to my office and say, "Look, we're getting twice the things. Do you want to spend another $2 million, $3 million this month?" So because it's sales, which is great for the future, and because you can do it quickly, that would be the one area, Pete, that we would step on the gas. 
Operator: Your next question is from David Togut of Evercore ISI. 
David Togut: I have 2. First up, Ron, when looking at the 19% growth in Corporate Payments, could you talk through what were the strongest growth verticals in the quarter? And then based on the new business signings that you saw, what would you expect to be kind of the highest growth verticals within Corporate Payments going forward?
 And then the second question, looking at the 18% revenue growth in the tolls business, is it possible to break down the growth contribution of that 18% between toll tags and transaction growth? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. So let me -- anyway, good to hear from you, David. So let me take the first thing. So when you refer to verticals, I don't know if you're referring to the customer verticals or the products, but let me try to answer both. So on the kind of product line side, what we call the full AP or full outsourcing, is obviously going, right, great. It's grown over 50%. So obviously, well above the line average. And the good news, which you implied, is it also represented half of our sales, so a much larger part of our new sales than it does of our revenue, obviously, which is why it's growing faster.
 And then on the customer side, I would say we're just going gangbusters in the construction vertical. That vertical has come back. It's super healthy, at least here in the United States. We've got a  super great position in terms of partners, the accounting and ERP partners. We've got a great merchant network. And so the sales and the interest from that channel is just at record levels for us.  Doesn't mean we're not selling in other places too, but that one's going great. Do you, Chuck, want to take the -- David's second question? 
Charles Freund: Yes. I think if you were to look at even in our exhibits to the financials, you'll see the 18% growth in tolls, 5% tag growth, and then our revenue per tag is up 12. And so part of that is pricing adjustments we make. Some of that is inflation in the country, which we can pass on to the cardholders. And a little bit of it is some of the MDR that we're getting from some of these non-toll-related purchases, like parking or fast food or fuel.
 It's still a fairly small piece. But as we build out, particularly the fuel network, we expect it to be much more in the next couple of years. 
Ronald F. Clarke: But David, hey, I know you've been excited with this one. So I'll share a little bit of the forward view. So I called out 1.7 million transactions. So the guy that runs that business has a bet with me, that it will be 10 million-plus for the year.
 And so the thing has gone from, hey, it's an idea here, let's see how we go, to really exiting, [ even really, they're growing like weed ] during this year and exiting at some kind of crazy level. And we plan to double again next year the accepting sites. We have the same 6 million vehicles or tag holders. So it's a little too early to say mission accomplished, but that thing is really working now. 
Operator: Your next question is from George Mihalos of Cowen. 
Georgios Mihalos: Let me add my congrats on the quarter. I guess first question, Charles, if we just look at the updated guidance, you're taking revenues up 5% higher than where they were previously. The adjusted net income, that's going up about 2 points, so there's a bit of a differential.
 Can you just kind of bridge that gap for us? I assume one of them had -- or part of that is going to be interest expense, but maybe what else is maybe weighing down some of the growth in the adjusted net income relative to the better revenue outlook? 
Charles Freund: Yes, so you hit the nail in the head. Definitely, interest expense will be going up. The other one is our tax rate. So in the first half of this year, we are still getting some benefit from stock option exercises of some very low-priced stock options that are actually expiring in Q2. So we don't see that we'll get that benefit in the second half. And so that, of course, changed the flow-through. 
Ronald F. Clarke: And George, it's Ron. Let me just add to that. It's all below the line, so the $100 million of kind of upside from our initial guide, right, rest of year, hey, why isn't it flowing through. At the EBITDA line, our rest of year will be up a couple of points from our Q1 print. So we will get operating leverage down there. It's all the 2 things Chuck just said. I mean it's a [ whopper ] forecast we have on interest expense. I mean who knows.
 But we put in, I think chuck has it in the back up there, some obviously massive increase as we run through the year in interest expense, and then a tax rate, again, that's high, I mean, on $1.3 billion or $1.4 billion of cash, PBT, every point or 2 is big. And so we're losing it in just in those 2 things. But I want to make sure with people here, that the operating leverage line, that thing is flowing through. It's going to be way better than Q1. 
Georgios Mihalos: Okay. That's great. That's exactly what I was getting at. So I really appreciate that color. And then... 
Ronald F. Clarke: [ And if you can work on even the ] interest rates down, that would help us, too. 
Georgios Mihalos: Fair point. That might be a bit tough to do. Just to close out that point, how many rate increases are you factoring in now to this increased interest expense guidance? Congrats on the quarter. 
Charles Freund: Yes. So we gave kind of a forward curve on fuel prices. Let me give you the forward curve that we're using for the interest expense. We're looking at LIBOR equivalent of 83 bps in Q2, 159 bps in Q3 and 221 bps in Q4. 
Operator: Your next question is from Trevor Williams of Jefferies. 
Trevor Williams: And I had another question on the guide as well and more just on the macro assumptions you have underpinning and particularly in fuel. Just in terms of underlying volumes, are you guys assuming the rest of the year follows kind of normal pre-COVID seasonal trends? And then is there any notable callouts just on what you're assuming? Any differences between the U.S. and Europe and then the U.K. within Europe, in particular? 
Charles Freund: I would say, in terms of volumes, we've seen more of a recovery in Europe because they were more in the ditch, and we've seen a bit of a bounce back also in Australia with fuel volumes. But going forward, we don't have a lot of COVID-related recovery, so it would follow kind of normal seasonality.
 And the fuel prices assumptions as we outlined them, they really don't change anything in terms of our volume. It will change demand for the product, as Ron mentioned, digitally. But our customers have to drive for work or they have to make the deliveries, they have to make the service calls, et cetera, et cetera. So the pricing doesn't really matter. But yes, volumes should fall kind of in a normal seasonal course. 
Trevor Williams: Okay. Perfect. And then on capital allocation, it looks like the updated full year guide isn't embedding anything additional on buybacks. Just, Ron, any update just in terms of how you're thinking about capital allocation priorities between buybacks, I mean, the debt paydown potentially with where rates are going, M&A? Any help there just on your framework for how you're thinking about it. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. You got it. So no is the answer to the first question. We provide guidance basically with a 100% delevering assumption because unless we do something, that is what we do. It's the default. So that's what's in the forward guide.
 I would say really unchanged. Our first course is always M&A. If we have assets that we can dramatically improve or add meaningful capabilities, that's our first and highest use of capital. But looking at the FLT stock price today, you can imagine that my interest in buying FLT stock is high. So clearly, I don't know if Chuck has put it out there, we've got $1 billion-something in our current facilities generating, whatever, a few hundred million more a quarter.
 So we've got, obviously, a lot of liquidity to spend. So my guess is both will happen. There will be some transactions we'll try to get done. At these prices, we are buyers of our stock. And so it's likely, if we're sitting here 9 months from today, they will have done some of both of those things. 
Operator: And your next question is from Ken Suchoski of Autonomous Research. 
Kenneth Suchoski: I wanted to ask about the lodging segment because I don't think we've touched on it yet, and there were some decent growth there. There's a lot of noise trying to track the recovery relative to pre-COVID levels, just given the acquisitions over the last few years. But I was wondering how -- if things fully normalize to pre-COVID levels, where would that lodging business be in terms of revenue and/or room nights? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Hey, Ken, it's Ron. It's a good question. So you're right, whatever it is, the 60% print is happiness everywhere, right? It's a deal getting into the insurance vertical. It's the recovery of our airline segment there, right, as airline travel and flights have come back. And it's also our core workforce space. Our clients have gotten healthier and done more driving kinds of travel. So all 3 happy things are happening in the base.
 I would say that that's, again, a high-teens business for us. If you said, "Hey, you get through this and you get to kind of some normal baseline or normal comp, the market potential is enormous in all 3 of those."
 Obviously, the airline business is global. We just bought a little software company that we think is going to be incredibly helpful to some of those global airline sales. So the prospects we look way harder now in taking the core workforce product and launching it in Europe. We finally have an idea of how to do that to increase the TAM. So the prospects for that thing are great. It's the lowest as [ MMC ] in the company, which means we sell new business more efficiently there than any other line of business in the company. The margins in the business are super-duper good. So we love the business. 
Kenneth Suchoski: Great. That's really helpful. And maybe just as my follow-up question. There's a lot of competitors on the AP automation side of the business. Your full AP business continues to grow really quickly. Can you just talk about what you're seeing on the RFP side? Are they getting more crowded? Or are we still early days of that adoption curve? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I think it's mostly b. You're right. There's more people and more products. But as you laid out, the game is distribution. And the game is networks. Just to remind everybody, the products don't work if you can't monetize, if the cards don't monetize. Otherwise, you're relegated to a software fee.
 And so we just love -- I've said this a million times, is we -- maybe we don't have the world's greatest, but we got a pretty good product. And we have a couple of things that the new guys, right, don't, which is kind of proven, aged, distribution, that can create pressure on the marketplace. And we've got a 10-year-old merchant network, right, that accepts these purchasing and virtual cards.
 And so we're able to actually process and create economics. So we still -- I still feel like we've got a big advantage in the offer, but mostly, what you said, that it's just kind of -- it's just white space. It's just lots of companies are on kind of an old, just join a kind of clunky model. And what we and other people have is certainly way better than what they're doing. And so that group will win some share. But as I mentioned, we're selling a lot. So we're winning share.
 So again, I hope I can make this point, but we want to be in the disruptor. We're kind of the new guy, still taking the business from kind of the old method, so we want to join these other people, basically that you guys see as disrupting, and put us in the bucket of trying to go get that business. So that's our view of it. 
Operator: No more questions. Please continue. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Thanks for joining us today. Let us know if you need anything else. So have a nice evening. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference call, and thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-08 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, welcome to the FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. 
 I will now turn the conference over to your host, Jim Eglseder, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. 
James Eglseder: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings call. With me today are Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO; and Charles Freund, our CFO. Following their prepared comments, the operator will announce the queue will open for the Q&A session. It is only then that you can get in line for questions. 
 Please note that our earnings release and supplement can be found under the Investor Relations section of our website at fleetcor.com. 
 Now throughout this call, we will be discussing organic growth. As a reminder, organic revenue growth neutralizes the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and fuel spreads, and includes pro forma results for acquisitions closed during the 2 years being compared. We will also be discussing non-GAAP financial metrics, including revenues, net income and net income per diluted share, all on an adjusted basis. These measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than at other companies. Reconciliations of the historical non-GAAP to the most directly comparable GAAP information can be found in today's press release and on our website. 
 I do need to remind everybody that part of our discussion today may include forward-looking statements. These statements reflect the best information we have as of today. All statements about our outlook, new products and expectations regarding business development and future acquisitions are based on that information. They are not guarantees of future performance and you should not put undue reliance upon them. We undertake no obligation to update any of these statements. These expected results are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K and in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available on our website and at sec.gov. 
 Now with that out of the way, I will turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay. Jim, thanks. 
 Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q4 earnings call. So upfront here, I plan to cover 3 subjects. So first, provide my view of Q4, along with full year '21 results; second, lay out our 2022 guidance and priorities for the year; and then lastly, I'll share my thoughts on the company's midterm imperatives. 
 Okay. Let me make the turn to our Q4 results, which were quite good. So we reported revenue of $802 million, up 30% and cash EPS of $3.72 , that's up 24%, both record-highs for the company. Revenue came in quite hot, almost $40 million higher than the revenue guidance we provided 90 days ago. Organic revenue growth for Q4, good. Up 17%, also up 7% against Q4 of '19. Every line of business, double-digit organic revenue growth in the quarter. Our Q4 trends continued quite good. Record sales in the quarter, up 40% versus prior year. Steady revenue retention at 93%. Same-store sales, healthy at plus 6%. 
 We have had some notable callout since we spoke last. We formalized our partnership with the largest bank in Brazil which will help distribute our toll products, so we expect a lift there. We launched formally our Corpay One SMB platform business, so getting our corporate payments business into the SMB space. We just completed another investment in an EV software company. We upsized our term loan of $750 million. We repurchased over 3 million FLT shares in Q4 and in January. And we completed the rebranding of our corporate payments business. All the brands now under Corpay. So in summary, really a good finish to the year better than we expected and the trends helpful as we look into 2022. 
 Okay. Let me turn to 2021 full year. I think we characterize 2021 really as a comeback year, where we moved ahead of our 2019 pre-pandemic baseline. Really good financial results. '21 revenue of $2.8 billion, up 19%. Cash EPS of $13.21, also up 19%. Both of those results, record-highs for the company. We did open 2021 with an initial guide of $12.31 of cash EPS at the midpoint, so now finishing $0.90 better than that in initial guide. So clearly a better year than expected. 
 Organic revenue growth for 2021, up 12%. That's the highest organic revenue growth that we've ever reported. 2021 sales, super good. Record levels, up 46% versus 2020 and up 19% versus 2019. We've added 175,000 new clients. 175,000 new clients to our books in '21 across the world. So strong demand for our services. We did close 2 accretive acquisitions in '21 and expect together those to deliver $0.50 to $0.60 of incremental cash EPS here in '22. So all in all, a meaningful recovery from 2020. 
 All right. Let me cover now our initial thoughts on 2022 guidance along with the priorities for the year. We've mentioned before our stated midterm objectives for the company are to grow sales 20% plus, to grow organic revenue 10% plus, and to grow cash EPS 15% to 20%. Good news, our '22 guidance meets all 3 of these objectives, so here it goes. 
 For revenue in 2022, at the midpoint, $3.22 billion, that's up 14%; cash EPS of $15.25 at the midpoint, up 15%; organic revenue growth overall, up 10%; and sales growth just over 20%. This guidance does not include any forward capital allocation beyond deleveraging. 
 There is no real macro help in these numbers. We're basically outlooking the macro to be neutral. Yes, higher fuel prices, but really offset by some weaker FX. We have assumed about a 1% COVID recovery in our same-store sales client base coming back this year in '22. 
 Confidence, pretty high in these numbers. About half of the expected year-over-year performance improvement is already in our exit rate or run rate coming into the year so that helps. Our recent sales and retention trends support the forecast. Most of the synergies for the 2 big acquisitions are really already baked so we expect to get that accretion. And we have repurchased about 6.5 million shares from a year ago, so obviously going to be quite accretive. 
 In terms of priorities, we have picked a few things that we'll invest in incrementally this year. So digital sales. We're expecting a big increase in digital sales production in '22 and are making, thus, incremental investments in digital advertising and staff. IT. Big investments in IT transformation to accelerate our move to the cloud. And this platform business that I spoke of, where we're joining up our walk-around services with our central AP services. Going to push those platforms pretty hard and get a read on demand. So all in all, a pretty ambitious year. 
 Okay. So last up today, I'd like to talk about our midterm prospects and the imperatives for the company. I thought it might be helpful to rewind just a bit for anyone new on the call, just remind everyone who FLEETCOR is and what we're trying to do. 
 So in a nutshell, FLEETCOR provides B2B specialty payment solutions, really all intended to do one thing, which is to help businesses, our clients, spend less, primarily by controlling what they buy and what they pay for. Our differentiation kind of really comes in 2 forms. 
 First, our products are highly specialized. We target certain kinds of clients with very specialized needs. So our products would look different for trucking firms than they would look for plumbing firms. Our travel services would look different for blue collar travelers than they would for white collar travelers. So very dialed-in kind of product line. 
 And second, we operate more than 15 proprietary acceptance networks. That allows us to capture very unique data at the point of sale. We also enjoy very favorable economics, which we share with our clients. So this focused or specialized approach, coupled with a two-sided business model has allowed us to deliver consistent growth over a long period of time. 
 So let me turn to the 3 imperatives, the big things that we're on that we think are critical to driving sustained growth over the long term. So first up is EV. We're working EV and the energy transition hard. We do feel like we've made a lot of progress so far. 
 So both here and in Europe, we've added public acceptance networks for EV, so public charge points or recharge points. We've invested in EV software companies that facilitate at-home recharging and reimbursement. We signed up a few hundred clients to our EV service to get feedback on the service. And initially here, we're seeing the revenue or the economics from our service, EV service, roughly in line with our more traditional refueling services. So look, we're on this EV. We'll manage along with the transition and continue to report out. 
 Second imperative is digital, where company's working super hard to make the digital transition, accelerated by COVID. So the first thing I'd say is sales has really made a pivot. So last year, over 50% of our global fuel card sales came in digitally and over half of those processing end-to-end with no human intervention. On the marketing front, we've moved our focus to top of the funnel. So we're using digital advertising, ABM technology to identify prospects interested in our services. 
 On the client experience front, we've really advanced our UIs and their capability to allow our clients to do more themselves. So faster and easier than ever before. And at the point of sale, we've added new ways to transact with us beyond cards. So including mobile phones, RFID technology, even connected cars. So a lot of progress on the digital front. 
 So last up is diversification, transitioning our portfolio to bigger TAMs, into higher-growth segments. So you've heard us speak of beyond -- going beyond, in which we extend each of our existing businesses into adjacent market segments to create more opportunity. 
 So just a few examples there. So our corporate payments business, traditionally a middle markets business, now entering the SMB space. Our traveler lodging business, really a workforce, a blue collar-focused business has recently added airline or lodging for crews, and displaced homeowners or homeowners' insurance companies really to extend the potential of that business. In Brazil, historically, a toll-centric, highway-centric client base, we're now adding hundreds of thousands of urban or city dwellers to our expanded offering. So look, over time, we do expect these adjacencies to increase the opportunity for each of our businesses. 
 Platform business. I mentioned we will join up our specialized payment solutions into one comprehensive platform in which a single business or client could use, for example, our smart business cards, our travel solutions and our online billpay services all from the same UI and all from us. So this platform concept really combines our capabilities for employee walk-around kinds of purchases along with central billpay. So we think the platform idea has big potential and can be quite additive to the specialized payment services that we offer now. 
 As a result of these extensions, we are expecting our global fleet card business to account for about 40% of the company's revenue this year. That's down from about 50% 5 years ago. So again, repositioning for faster growth. So we do plan to work these 3 midterm imperatives hard: EV, digital and diversification. Of course, we'll report progress as we go. 
 So in conclusion today, back to Q4. Again, better than we expected and good trends coming into this year. 2021, really, again, a comeback year, finishing much, much better than we thought at the outset. This year, 2022, another guide to growth. Organic growth of expected at 10%, earnings expected to be up 15%, so a lot of distance from our pre-pandemic baseline. And the midterm, again, we're pretty focused on these 3 imperatives that I just outlined, key to sustainable growth for the company. 
 So with that, let me turn the call back over to Chuck to provide some additional details on the quarter. Chuck? 
Charles Freund: Thanks, Ron. 
 So jumping into the product category details behind our 17% organic revenue growth in Q4, corporate payments was up 18%, with another quarter of strong performance in full AP, which was up over 50% yet again. Our card products, virtual and multicard, were up 16%, and cross-border was up 14%, which is normalized for the AFEX acquisition we closed in June. In cross-border, we completed the final customer migrations from AFEX' systems to our Corpay cross-border platform in December. And we'll continue with the integration of back-office systems and processes throughout this year. Our thesis are holding, with synergies and accretion in line with our expectations. 
 I'd like to give a big shout out to our integration team as it's due to their hard work and dedication that the conversion has been so seamless and successful. 
 Fuel was up organically 12%, with growth in every geography largely as a result of our digital sales efforts and strong retention rates. Our ability to sell and retain fuel card customers around the world demonstrates the attractiveness of our offers, the competitiveness of our products and the effectiveness of our technology. 
 We continue to make good progress in developing and marketing our EV charge management solutions, particularly in Europe, where we now have over 5,000 clients with EV-enabled cards or fobs. We've also been actively expanding the on-road network acceptance of our EV solutions, with approximately 6,500 charge points in the U.K. now accepting our products. This represents about 22% coverage of all publicly available charge points in the country. 
 On the continent, we've got around 85% coverage as our products are accepted at roughly 190,000 charge points. We've built a dedicated organization to advance our EV efforts and will continue to support our fuel card customers as they slowly migrate to EVs. 
 Tolls was up 17% compared with last year as strong new, sales up 20%, and some new retention initiatives are really paying off. We made tremendous progress to expand our toll business this year. We doubled our fuel locations year-over-year to nearly 1,200, and we had nearly 0.5 million active fuel users as of year-end. 
 We recently signed Mitsubishi, Hyundai, Toyota and Kia to install our tags on vehicles before they leave the factories. And as Ron mentioned earlier, we completed our joint venture with Caixa, Brazil's largest bank.
 Our lodging business continued to perform well, up 39%. Workforce lodging has improved with higher volume, and airlines especially outperformed, with organic growth over 100% as domestic air travel rebounded from COVID lows. The integration of ALE Solutions, a provider of lodging services to displaced policyholders of major insurance companies, is going quite smoothly, and we're increasingly confident in the value it will deliver. 
 Gift organic growth was 19% year-over-year as the new efforts we've discussed on the last several calls continue to produce results, especially the retailer online sales channel. We also saw a pick-up in card replenishment orders, which had been delayed due to COVID concerns. 
 Now looking further down the income statement, operating expenses of $462 million represented an increase over prior year, primarily due to the addition of the AFEX and ALE operations as well as higher deal and integration-related costs, increases tied to higher volumes across our businesses, stock compensation, and new sales generation activities and investments to drive future growth. 
 Bad debt expense was $18.5 million or 5 basis points as credit losses have returned to more historical levels. Interest expense decreased 9% year-over-year due to a slight decline in LIBOR rates and the offset of higher interest rates applied to customer deposits and cash balances in certain foreign jurisdictions. We incurred $9.9 million of cost during the quarter associated with the incremental $750 million in Term B debt we added in December. 
 On the Term B increase, the rate was the same as our existing facility at LIBOR plus 175 basis points and matures in April 2028. Our ratings and leverage remained effectively unchanged, reflecting the strength and earnings power of our company. 
 Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.6% versus 20.3% last year, with the increase driven primarily by the lack of excess tax benefit on stock option exercises. 
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with over $1.5 billion in unrestricted cash, and we had $1.1 billion available on our revolver. There was $4.9 billion outstanding on our credit facilities, which included the incremental $750 million Term B debt I just mentioned. Finally, we had $1.1 billion borrowed in our securitization facility. All in, as of December 31, our leverage ratio was 2.71x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement. 
 As Ron mentioned, in the quarter, we repurchased roughly 2.3 million shares. And in total, we repurchased about 5.5 million shares during 2021. We also bought 1.1 million shares in January under our 10b5-1 plan. You may have seen in our press release that our Board authorized another $1 billion in repurchases. So taking all of that into account, we still have almost $1.4 billion authorized for repurchases as of today. 
 We believe we have ample liquidity to pursue any near-term M&A opportunities and continue to buy back shares when it makes sense. I think it's important to remind everyone of the power that our earnings and cash flow gives us. Recapping 2021, we repurchased 5.5 million shares for $1.36 billion. Our guidance for share count for 2022 is down 7 million shares from what we guided a year ago. We spent $950 million on deals, which will generate incremental earnings of $0.50 to $0.60 per share next year and continue to provide growth in future years. 
 We also raised an additional $1.55 billion of Term B debt, $800 million in Q2 and $750 million in Q4, at very attractive rates and terms. And our leverage barely changed. 
 We believe the combination of our strong position, the structure of our business model and high recurring revenues will enable us to deliver consistent quality growth year after year after year. 
 Now let me share some thoughts on our Q1 outlook and our full-year assumptions. Looking ahead, we're expecting Q1 2022 revenue to be between $740 million and $760 million, and adjusted net income per share to be between $3.45 and $3.55, which at the midpoint is approximately $0.68 and or 24% higher than what we reported in Q1 of 2021. 
 You may notice the midpoint of our Q1 guide is also approximately $0.22 or 6% lower than what we reported in Q4 of 2021. This is largely due to revenue seasonality, where certain businesses, such as gift and tolls, have strong fourth quarters while fuel and lodging tend to have soft first quarters due to weather and holidays. As such, the first quarter tends to be the lowest in terms of both revenue and profit for our company. 
 I'd like to note a few assumptions underlying the full year 2022 guidance Ron provided earlier. We expect bad debt to be about $30 million higher than 2021 levels as we see a return to more normalized credit losses, due in part to increasing sales production. Our interest expense guidance of $90 million to $100 million assumes 3 25 basis point rate increases throughout the year. And our tax rate is also expected to be higher, at between 24% and 26%, as we expect any excess tax benefit from stock option exercises to remain low relative to the last few years. 
 The effects of these higher expenses will be partially offset by the lower share count resulting from our repurchase activity over the past 13 months. The rest of our assumptions can be found in our press release and supplement. 
 Now let's move beyond the results and the outlook. Since we last spoke, our new ESG report was published and is available in the Investor Relations section of our website. Some highlights you will find in the document are: more details around our workforce advantage, including our comprehensive employee development and training programs; and our adoption of the Rooney Rule for all vice-president-and-above positions; as well as some reporting on our global data centers, including the significant reduction in power usage and footprint which are down 40% and 62%, respectively, over the last 5 years. 
 Finally, I would like to thank our nearly 10,000 employees around the world who helped us deliver a strong finish to a great year and who will be the driving force to even greater heights in 2022. Thank you for your interest in FLEETCOR. 
 And now, operator, we'd like to open the line for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Pete Christiansen with Citi. 
Peter Christiansen: [Technical Difficulty] 
 which is good to see. Ron, looking at the outlook, which... 
Ronald F. Clarke: Pete, we're struggling to hear you. 
Peter Christiansen: I'm sorry, can you hear me? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. We -- I can, now. 
Peter Christiansen: [indiscernible] 
Ronald F. Clarke: If you could dial back in. We can take the next question. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Congratulations on solid results in the fourth quarter here. I wanted to ask about CapEx as a percentage of revenue. It looks like it moved up to 4% from 3% where it's been for quite some time. Now I know Ron called out a lot of critical business investment. 
 But I'm just wondering, should we view the investment you're making as more kind of cyclical in nature? And meaning, you'll kind of finish with this investment cycle and maybe CapEx as a percentage of revenue will tick back down again? Or is this sort of what we should expect in terms of a new level of business investment going forward? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Ramsey, it's Ron. I'd say probably the latter. Probably think about this level, this 4%-ish level. And the 2 drivers, kind of new things in the last couple of years, would be that Brazil network buildout that we've referenced before. So a fair amount of cost in getting those incremental few thousand stations up. And then two, we've earmarked a fair amount of kind of incremental money through the IT transformation. So not just enhancing, obviously, the systems we have, but effectively building new ones in parallel. So I'd say those couple of things would have at least probably a couple more years to run and then it may bottom back down a bit. 
Ramsey El-Assal: And on capital deployment or balance sheet deployment, more generally, maybe Ron, if you could give us your view on the appetite for sort of, A, first, buybacks versus M&A? And then on the M&A side, I'm really curious to see whether you're seeing more opportunities emerge or the deal pipeline increasing just because the valuation environment seems to have shifted down quite a bit. It might be a little too soon, but I'm just curious what you're seeing out there. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Good question. So I'd say that our priorities are unchanged, Ramsey,right? We're first M&A, if we like it, for capabilities and/or it's accretive. But as you can tell from Chuck's comments earlier, we -- what did we say, 6.5 million shares we bought back in the last 12 months. So we've had a bit of an appetite for our own stock, which we think is appropriate. 
 In terms of the M&A, we did press the pause button, call it, 3 months ago when we saw the volatility, both in our own stock and in some of the others in our category. And so literally post this, we're going to kind of reach back out to some of those things that are super late in the pipeline and test where sellers are basically. We've got a view of where we are now. So I'd say ask me again in 30 days whether sellers have got the message that things are volatile and maybe at a lower price that they'll take. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. 
Darrin Peller: When we look forward on the fuel segment, on a stack basis, you're running in the low single-digit range now, but I think embedded in your outlook is definitely an acceleration. Can you talk through that a bit in terms of the OTR side versus the fleet -- the local fleets, and really how you're going to bridging from the run rate now to a higher level of growth? And then I just have a quick follow-up on the corporate payments side. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Darrin, hey, it's Ron. Yes. I'd say the guide embedded in the guide for '22 would be high single digits for fuel cards, so off of obviously more normalized comps this year. And Part B, yes, the OTR, which is, I don't know, call it, 30% of our business globally across Europe and Brazil continues to run softer, right? The COVID impact, getting drivers to soften that business more. So I think inside of our high single digit, that thing would be a smidge softer than the local or partner business. 
Darrin Peller: Okay. And you've had decent sales [ flow ] that's probably flowing through, too, right now? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. This -- you kind of cut out a bit. But if you said we had decent sales, I mean we've had literally record sales in the fuel card business. 
Darrin Peller: Right. Yes, I figure that's flowing through starting now. 
 Just a quick follow-up on the corporate payments side. I mean, really, I'm trying to figure out when the cross-sell, you think, is going to really kick into full gear for Corpay, right. When we think about the opportunity in really the software in Nvoicepay side versus the virtual car alone, but really the holistic offering, where do you think we're going to be? When do you think we're going to be in a full-scale effort around that initiative? Which sounds like -- I know there's been a lot of good industry chatter on it, but that could probably flow through to some meaningful trends. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, another good question. I'd say probably another quarter or so, and let me tell you why. So we started out, call it, in the second half testing, going out to, call it, 1,000 clients, 2,000 clients, putting them on a new payment platform, seeing if they had an interest in our new platform, billpay solution, saw some decent reaction to it. And so what we've decided to do is kind of be careful in changing the payment platform and basically presenting a new service at the same time. 
 We want to be super cautious around not upsetting, if you will, the golden goose of these fuel card clients. So we're moving to put that platform in against a broader set of clients, get them comfortable using that and then effectively present harder this add-on for them. So my guess is probably somewhere in Q2, we'll be able to report out on it. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Just a question on the expense growth. Obviously, very strong coming out of the pandemic, sort of deflationary there. Could you just talk about how much is driven by inflationary pressure versus more investments you're making? And kind of what you're assuming that's going to translate to in terms of top line growth? 
Charles Freund: Yes, Sanjay, this is Charles. So the expense growth you're seeing comes from a couple of different areas. One, we've got the AFEX and ALE acquisitions that are rolling in, so that's number one. Two, we've got the normalization of credit losses. We expect that to be quite a bit higher, some [ start comp ] in there. Also related to the deals, we've got ongoing integration costs. The AFEX integration is probably the most advanced we'll have taken as a company, so to really move them off their systems, close redundant offices, et cetera. It's a multiyear journey there and we're spending money to basically create synergies for the future. So that's also kind of baked in, both in the fourth quarter here as well as into our guide for next year. 
 We are seeing some inflationary pressure predominantly around staffing. So wages in some of the call centers and such, we've taken measures to remedy that. As it relates to vendors, a little bit. But I'd say that, that will help us eventually as it flows through to vendor payments in, say, our corporate payments arena. So it's a tale of two cities, right? We're going to have some additional costs from inflation, but we'll also get some benefit from it on the revenue side. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Sanjay, it's Ron. Let just jump on the last thing Chuck said, which would be some of the increment is really directed by us, choice that we made around EV capabilities and sales. And again, some testing and advertising things and even in IT to really better position the business. We like the profit number we got to. So in addition to the factors that Chuck just laid out, I do want you to hear that we've chosen to chase some things that help the company on a forward basis. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Understood. And I actually have a follow-up question on the EV point. I'm just curious, Ron, like how you think the distribution channels are going to look like in the future, some payment processors that partnered with like the auto manufacturers? And I'm just curious how unconventional the partnerships that you're trying to forge are going forward. I know you have some of them, but maybe you can just speak to what you're targeting. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I think it's actually been the other way so far. I think that we announced again a follow-on in kind of a new investment in software companies. I think companies that are working on software see people like us, leasing companies, as the best distribution pipe in the fleet, particularly as they're mixing stuff. And so we continue to like our chances, both offering that back to our client base because we're first to see if they're moving off of a fuel -- of internal combustion approach to something else so we could spot it in our client base. And then B, we've got obviously lots of coverage generally, right, to bring new clients into the fold. And so I'd say, for sure, our distribution capabilities are probably as good as any. 
 With that said, we did mention the Brazil thing, which is a bit of a case study where we've now basically put tags -- effectively, toll tags in with 3 or 4 partners literally as those cars come off the line. So when you buy your new Kia or whatever the heck it is, Nissan, in Brazil, it's got a Sem Parar tag when you come out. 
 So look, we think over time, these cars will be coming off the line connected, where they're sending data every couple of seconds. And so we mostly want to be set up just to grab that, relationships where we have access to that connected car information and can then help, again, the client, whether he's at a public location or road location or at home basically pay for the thing. So I would say -- I said earlier in the office, we are just so much smarter on this transition now and how to play and how we're advantaged or not and what help we need. So I don't know if we're communicating it well, but we are just in a way better spot than we were. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Trevor Williams with Jefferies. 
Trevor Williams: I wanted to ask another one on expenses, kind of similar to what Sanjay was getting after. But so margins in Q4 were down about 300 basis points from the third quarter despite all the revenue upside. I mean is this kind of a new stepped-up level of spend that's just kind of rebased higher that we should just expect to run through 2022? 
 Just kind of as we're thinking about how much leverage you can get from -- you're guiding to 14% revenue growth next year, if you do better than that, if we get kind of another light back just on some of the piece of the revenue pie that are still kind of lagging versus '19. So just give us a sense for kind of what your -- for how we should be thinking about operating leverage going forward, given that you've already -- it seems like in the last couple of quarters, there's been a stepped-up level of investment to kind of prepare for the new go-to-market strategy. 
Charles Freund: Yes. Trevor, it's Charles. I'd say that it is a bit of a reset. So some of the acquisitions that we bought do operate at slightly lower margins. So they're dealing with big airlines or insurance companies, right? These are very, very focused on the rates they pay, and then also require a very, very high levels of service. And so we need to make investments. And as the airline volumes of revenue is pouring back, we need to staff up to accommodate those service level requirements. 
 So I think the 54% is probably a good assumption going for next year. And as Ron mentioned, we are continuing to make investments for future growth. And so I'd say, operating margin should hold at that level for the remainder of this year. 
Trevor Williams: Okay. Got it. And then, Charles, just a follow up on interest expense. It sounds like you guys have 3 hikes built into what you're guiding to for '22. Can you give us a sense just -- and even if it's not an exact number, that's fine. But if we end up at 5 or 6 hikes what the interest expense sensitivity could look like in that scenario? 
Charles Freund: We've got about $5.9 billion that would flow with LIBOR. So for every 25 basis points, you're looking at kind of $14 million to $15 million of incremental annualized expense, so you got to layer that in over time. On the flip side, we do have customer deposits and cash balances that sit around the world, and we're earning pretty good interest on those. And so if interest rates continue to rise around the world, we might actually see enough benefit. 
James Eglseder: Alex? 
 [Technical Difficulty] 
 Okay. Thanks, Trevor. I apologize for any technical difficulties. It looks like we're going to take Tien-Tsin next. Except I can't promote him. Alex, can we take Tien-Tsin? All right, guys, let's see if we can do the next one. 
 Alex, can you hear us? Okay, he can hear us, but I don't know where the operator was. Guys, give us just a minute, okay, to get this sorted. 
 Okay. Well, while we wait for -- that's getting squared away, Pete's questions from earlier were, how should we think about expectations on the Corpay One SMB initiative factoring into the guide? Trying to understand if there's upside opportunity versus normalized corporate payments growth expectations. 
 I don't know if... 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Can people hear us? 
James Eglseder: Yes, they can hear us. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Pete, I don't think you can hear, but it's Ron. So I kind of answered a bit of this earlier that we're going a bit slower to be cautious on the cross-sell, and we are obviously selling to new prospects in the market. So I'd say it would be pretty minimal. So if you look at our overall corporate payments guide for the year, the SMB piece would still be relatively small, again, mostly because we're trying to be careful and make sure we have the acquisition economics, right? 
 So in terms of upside, I think, yes, since we don't have scalable views of that yet, I'd say as we get into the second half and get through some of the testing that's going to go on, there could be some upside. We could step on the gas there a bit if we like what we're seeing, and maybe lift the growth rate in the second half. 
James Eglseder: Okay. And then another question is, can you flesh out the Brazilian banking relationship a bit, how you see this impacting the value prop, and how could this impact future revenue growth going forward? 
Charles Freund: Yes. So we completed the joint venture with Caixa Bank. It's the largest bank in Brazil, tends to focus a bit more downmarket. So if you look at our historic Sem Parar business, we've tend to focus a bit more on -- I won't say, affluent, but kind of more middle class users and such. And with Caixa, we'll be able to, one, move a bit downmarket and leverage all of the distribution capabilities, so all the branches, their ATMs, et cetera. And so we view it as extensive distribution, but also reaching slightly different segments around the country that we just weren't as focused on historically. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Let me just jump on, Jim, and talk about it. Hey, it's Ron. I would just add to it that we love how incremental different distribution channels are. So when we bought the business, I can't remember, 70% or 80% of all new sales came through the stores, kiosks -- the [ 500 ] stores and in toll booths, where people were waiting in line, and we diversified that into digital hanging things at retail, outbound sales, et cetera, and then a whole slew of partners, including the manufacturers that Chuck referenced. 
 So what I'd say most is we just love the incremental nature of a bank and those accounts and those relationships and being in that channel. So we haven't put a ton into the guide yet because that thing just lifted off, I think, a couple of months -- 2, 3 months ago. But we are super excited about it because it is the single largest bank, largest set of account holders in the entire country. And so we're super hopeful again that, that will be additive. And to Chuck's point, because it targets a slightly different set of user than the traditional one. 
James Eglseder: And I think we have Alex back. Alex? 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize for the technical difficulties. We will now take our next question. 
 Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. 
Andrew Polkowitz: Hey, Ron, Charles, Jim. It's Andrew, actually, on for Tien-Tsin. Congrats on the quarter. 
 I wanted to ask a question on retention. So obviously, still running strong compared to pre-pandemic, a little bit of a slide quarter-over-quarter. But what I wanted to ask was, as you guys started to sell more services in bundled, with the Corpay integration, could there be any lift in terms of retention as you sell potentially stickier products? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Andrew, it's Ron. Yes, we actually have statistics on that. So we look at different cohorts, similar sets of clients and look at whether they have 1, 2, 3 kinds of services. And your thesis is absolutely right that as you move beyond one service, you're stickier with clients, have a deeper relationship, yes. So to the extent that we get what we call our platform or bundle to work and someone had walk-around products and then we were able to get their central billpay, we do think we'll get a lift. And particularly when the bundle could include smart business cards or fuel cards, which is the predominant walk-around. 
Andrew Polkowitz: Great. Just one more quick follow-up. I was just curious, were there any hiring pressures or wage pressures that impacted your clients, whether it be in the fuel or corporate payment side that might have been a little bit of a headwind as a result of this quarter that we could expect to normalize over time? 
Ronald F. Clarke: We had a little bit, actually. Chuck referred to this earlier in our lodging business, where we have a decent-sized servicing group which is one of the lowest wage groups kind of in the company. And so I'd say that's the place that we felt some pressure and responded to that in the fall, both to retain people that we were losing and to add additional people. I think like the rest of corporations in America, we're seeing some pressures in different areas, in IT, digital, certain pockets. But we basically have built that in again to the guide. I think it's been going on for, call it, 3 to 6 months. So I think we're comfortable with what we plan. 
Charles Freund: And Andrew, just to pick up on that, I think you were talking maybe wage pressure on some of our customers. And what I'd say there is we have seen that in lodging, in particular. And so our workforce lodging business, which has recovered, which is not to the extent that we -- where it could, is that they've had actually small businesses turn down jobs. And I can't travel there and do the work because I can't hire the people. 
 And so it will be interesting to see, as government subsidies and other things fall aside and see what happens to the employment market, but we think there is some upside opportunity there. Having built a whole lot into the plan a little bit, but not a whole lot. But wait and see, maybe truck drivers, too. Yes. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. 
Robert Napoli: Ron, I guess, could you give some color on your expectations for the growth of the corporate payments business in 2022 and I guess, over the medium term? And maybe the various pieces, full AP versus cross-border versus other? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Sure, Bob. I'd say the guide for that business in totality is in the high teens. And again, to your point, there's different pieces. The payables portion of that, virtual cards, full AP. Chuck mentioned the full AP, I think, grew 50% last quarter, so that will grow a bit faster. The partner business that we called out will grow slower than that and probably the cross-border business would be closer to the mid-teens. So there'll be those different pieces in it. 
 And you ask me this every time, "Hey, can you grow it faster?" Well, obviously, if we could spend more money. But we -- again, we try to balance what we spend to kind of growth target and a profit target and spend wisely so that we don't again have 50% new people or advertising that doesn't work. So we try again to be disciplined in terms of -- productive in terms of the monies that we spend. 
Robert Napoli: Then a follow-up question. Ron, as you called out at the beginning of the call, I mean, FLEETCOR has 15 proprietary acceptance networks, I think, for your fuel card business. Are that many necessary? Is there -- how do you think about those proprietary acceptance networks versus leveraging an open-loop network? What benefits are you getting out of that? Is there an opportunity to optimize? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, that's a great question. So the answer is it's not only our fuel cards business, it's kind of the underlying core of the company. So it's the same thing in lodging. We've got 15,000 hotels here in the U.S. out of, call it, 45,000 or 50,000. We have super economics again and unique data. We've got a toll network, for example, in Brazil. We have fuel networks in, I don't know, 10 countries, where it's impossible for you or someone to go try to create a proprietary network today. 
 So I call it out really just to remind new people that those networks and the volume that we run through them and the data that we collect and the economics that we collect are just massively advantageous to us when we turn around to the client side, to the business account side and pitch our offer to them. So I was really just trying to let people know that it's not some plain vanilla, jumping on someone else's network that everyone else basically has access to. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. 
David Togut: The lodging business did nicely, exceeded our forecast for revenue in the quarter. Could you walk through what your forecast is for lodging revenue growth in 2022? And if you could discuss some of the underlying drivers, kind of the domestic business versus the international business. And then talk a little bit about Travelliance which you acquired a couple of years ago, and are you seeing a nice recovery there. 
Charles Freund: Yes, David, this is Charles. So lodging performing extremely well. We do have some continued recovery to go there, particularly in the airline space. So a lot of the performance you're seeing here is reflective of the domestic air travel. International has still been way, way down versus historic norms. [ So seeing ] that kind of swinging back a bit next year. 
 Workforce has a bit of room to recover, but it's also just chugging along and doing pretty well. ALE business, which was a recent acquisition, accretive, a good buy for us. Still work to do to realize those synergies, but I'd say we're confident that the plans come together, so that looks pretty good. In terms of that specific line of business or product category, I have it in front of me. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Hey, David, it's Ron. I leave it here, as Chuck has talked, and so the guide on that thing is plus 20% organically and obviously crazy high in the 40s on a print basis because we bought something, I guess, closed in September. And the drivers to get to that are the sales plan is way up. I think the sales plan is up 35% or 40%. It's our plan for '22. And then what Chuck said that there's super sensitivity in that one, particularly the airline, for example, about 1/4 of that segment historically of our revenue came from international flights, which in Q4 was still effectively 0. 
 And so to the extent that the world opens and airlines go back crossing borders, again, let's say, in Q2, we have the contracts, and we're already serving the airlines on the domestic legs. And so we've assumed a little bit of kind of bounce back in that kind of in the second half. So it's big sales. It's bounce back in the airline thing. It's synergies that are baked into the recent acquisition, it's big sales plan. There's just a lot of things going right in that business. 
David Togut: Just a quick final question on capital allocation priorities for 2022. You've been very opportunistic with the stock at the current price, you've also been able to make some solid acquisitions. What's your thought process for the year ahead when you look at your stock at the current price versus what you have in the acquisition pipeline? 
Ronald F. Clarke: We're still buyers. I mean, I guess, I mentioned in my opening comments, that not only did we buy a couple of million shares in Q4, but we made the decision with the Board to keep buying at the price into January, right, through a 10b5. And so I don't know where the stock is going to be, but at this price, we're buyers. 
 And I think Chuck said it super well, Dave, earlier that with the liquidity we have, $1.5 billion, $1.7 billion, depending on what cash we elect to use, we can do a lot of things, right? At this kind of stock price, we can buy back still a lot more of the company. And as I mentioned, we're going to un-pause a set of deals that we worked on in the summer into the fall. And so my guess, if you said to me, "Hey, we talk in 6 months," is you see us do both. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Mihalos with Cowen. 
Georgios Mihalos: I guess, first, just to build off David's, the last one, can you sort of break down for us now the composition of revenue within lodging from your traditional blue collar business and the airlines business now? Just trying to get a sense of how they are in terms of size and how we should be thinking about that bounce back in airlines going forward if it materializes. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, that's a good question. So I think we probably get the details of that, but we do think of it in 3 pieces or 3 verticals. So we have what we call workforce, which is the original business we've owned for 10 years, which targets blue collar, travelers, a tree-cutting firm that goes when the power lines are down. And then a couple of verticals that we've gotten into the last couple of years of airline crew. So the airlines, again, it's a global business. 10% of the lodging rooms, I think, are crew around the world. So a nice segment for us to be in. 
 And then this newest one for us of homeowner insurers basically put people when you have water damage or a fire or something like that, they're putting people up and then put them into longer-term housing. So there's super unique things in terms of the systems that we integrate into -- right into the crew management system or into the claims system in the case of the insurer. The networks are a little bit different than we try to put together depending on who the traveler is. 
 And so I'd say that the 2 newest things would be circa 40%, just to give you kind of a number relative to the workforce [ figure ]. And the good news is all 3 of those, again, are growing for the reasons that I outlined a bit ago. 
Georgios Mihalos: Okay. Just a quick follow-up on the expense side. I know it's something that's been talked about here. But if we look at '22, I mean, certainly, it sounds like there are some expenses that are somewhat more transitory, right? You've got a big increase as the bad debt normalizes and starts to come back. Obviously, you've got some integration costs. But could you just help us think about how much of those are transitory specific to '22 versus sort of structural over the next several years as you accelerate investments to the cloud into your tech transformation? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, George, let me -- it's Ron. Let me take a swing and then Chuck can maybe provide a bit more detail. The way that I think about it, we think about it is what I'll call kind of discretionary expense so that we think about the business sitting there to operate and run the book of business we have, we need a set of expenses, right? We need IT to run and com and people and credit and things like that. And then the big incremental expenses are really sales and IT and then a little bit of management to figure out the way. And so those are gigantic. 
 They're -- call those things I'm talking about $600 million to $700 million of our total expense plan in '22. So the call for us is really just how much do we spend in those things, which, again, are 50% or more helping 2023 and 2024, right? Because by the time you sell the thing and get it on board and you do it by next Thanksgiving, you don't get the business until the following year, you build an IT thing, you don't roll it out until Christmas. 
 So that's the message I think that you ought to hear is we made the call when we like the revenue and profit guide that we can get to, to basically chase some things that we like, that we think are additive and incremental in the future years. And so the answer is it depends. If those things go well, we'll double down on it more. If they don't, we'll probably back off. If we need a different profit target, we may back off if we don't. 
 So I'd say that those are the ones we kind of keep in our hand on the steering wheel and decide kind of how much we want to do with it. Unless investors told me, "Hey, they don't care about what our profits are," and then we might do more of it. I haven't heard that yet, so -- but we're still balancing it. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with Truist. 
Andrew Jeffrey: Ron, lots of pretty interesting initiatives, I think, first, digital, which you noted is now half of fuel sales and the progress towards a platform selling motion. I'm trying to wrap my head around a little bit, and I don't expect you to speak to anything beyond '22, but is there anything that we should be thinking about as sort of leaking out of the bottom of the funnel if you're having success with more value-added solutions, maybe expanded spend on fuel cards. 
 I'm not sure you called that out this quarter in particular, but all this stuff collectively, should we think that maybe this business can grow faster at the current margin? Or is there -- I just want to make sure I'm not missing any puts and takes here that you'd want us to focus on. 
Ronald F. Clarke: It's a super good question, Andrew. And my answer, a little lawfully, would be it depends. So what I would say to you is this direction we're going of effectively repackaging and integrating a bunch of the products that we have has enormous incremental potential for the company because it will be served up differently, and it will appeal to different businesses than we're targeting today. 
 So the first message I'm trying to get everybody to say is we're on to something that leverages the capabilities we've built over 20 years, that it's a 10x kind of opportunity for the company. The process that we could make is going to be a function of the selling economics of that, which we're just getting into. 
 So if you said to me, "Hey, how do you think the profit margins will look in 2 or 3 years?" My answer is probably pretty similar of the set of businesses that we have because we've got great experience and history and statistics, and we know the curves. We kind of know what we can produce. 
 I would say we don't know that answer for some of these platform things. And so if those things sell kind of at a line average or even a smidge worse, I think you'll continue to see growth with similar kinds of margins. And if not, then we'll fight that fight when we get there and ask people, "Hey, would you rather see accelerated revenue with slightly lower margins?" If that's the conclusion. But it's really just a bit too -- it's a bit too early to call. 
Andrew Jeffrey: Okay. That's helpful. And then just philosophically or theoretically as a follow-up, is this a business that at some point you'd like to be simpler? Or do you feel really good about all the businesses you're in? I know gift has sort of been kind of a mixed bag over the years. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I think we -- it's a great question. I think that it's the oldest vantage point, like we made the great idea of talking to you guys and buy-side people about the way we run the company and we have these different things and stuff. When we sit around in the company, it's really pretty simple. I tried to say in my opening remarks of basically, we just work for businesses and we work on their expenses or their spend and we try to reduce it. Then the programs that we created control what they buy and what they pay for. So for us, whether it's the lodging room piece of spend or fuel or business card piece of spend or a vendor, it all looks like a business expense that we're trying to help control. 
 And the reason that it seems complicated is we've made like super specialized ways to do it. So we ended up like talking to everybody, "Hey, let me tell you about the super secret sauce I use in lodging versus whatever." And I think we're going to start to talk to the marketplace, to your point, a little simpler and just say, "Hey, look, we're about trying to help you spend less on kind of nonpayroll expenses, and we've got super special stuff and we've got kind of more generalized stuff. And what's your need, and we've got a product line. Let's see if we can help you." And maybe get a back off a little bit of all the detail that we provide everybody on how we make the sausage, I think. 
Andrew Jeffrey: Yes. I think that could help a lot. Very helpful, thanks. 
Ronald F. Clarke: The selling is a perfect example or whatever. Like we use this pivot we've made to digital. We use it everywhere in the company. We figured out how to build the tech stack. We figured out how to advertise. We figured out how to automate bidding. We figured out how to get applications processed through the system. We figured how to make credit instant. We've done like so many things that we can basically print and copy into the other businesses that we have. 
 And so I think you'll see more of that. As we launch this platform line, you'll see us tucking the things that we have into the platform. And they may seem more of the same to people than different. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research. 
Kenneth Suchoski: Ron, I wanted to follow up on some of the questions on EV. I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that the EV economics are roughly in line with traditional fueling services. So can you provide some insight on what the unit economics might look like for the EV offering? It's impressive that the transition to EV is revenue neutral. So I'm just curious what's driving that. 
Charles Freund: Ken, this is Charles. Good question. And I actually had our analyst pull data from the Netherlands, a country that's a little bit further ahead in terms of EV migration than the U.K., which is further ahead than the U.S. And there, we have about 18,000 clients. And we said, "Okay, let's split those clients into 2 categories: a group that only buys fuel. It has no EV. So IC, internal combustion engine-only; and then mixed fleets." And what I'd tell you is about 14% of the clients, about 2,500 clients are mixed fleets. So they've got both types of vehicles. And they tend to be larger, so the enterprise-level clients are moving faster. So the mixed fleets average about 20 cards per account or vehicles per account, whereas on the fuel-only fleet, say IC-only fleets, there are about 5 cars per account. 
 When I look at those mixed fleets, the actual revenue per vehicle that we receive on EVs versus fuel, it's actually slightly higher. And part of the reason is that these enterprise-level clients get rebates when they go out in the fuel networks, which we provide to them, which we don't see on the EV reporting side. And so the economics turn out to be neutral to actually slightly favorable on the EV side. And so without now getting into specifics, client-level type of revenue per, I would tell you that EV is about 20% higher for these mixed fleets. 
 Now of their cards, they've got about 15% to 20% over to EV already. So we're seeing some real data points here. But that just gives you enough sense of who's moving, the size of accounts that are moving, how far they moved and the economic kind of relationship there and why it is comparable. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Hey, Ken, it's Ron. It's a super important question so let me -- it's Ron, just chip on to what Chuck said. So to me, there was and is maybe a massive misconception that, "Hey, when a business moves to EV, you plug in and everything is free." So goodbye, FLEETCOR, tough day. So the 2 things that I can't not admit that somewhere years ago, I was worried when I was dumber. But the 2 things that are clear are: one, it costs way more to recharge an EV vehicle than people thought. Certainly, when you do it publicly. There's a huge markup on the electricity, obviously, because the charge point versus trying to make money and there's way higher MDR for people like us because they're trying to build up volume. 
 So the first misconception is, "Oh, it costs $50 to fill up a van and only $5 to recharge a van." So that's not true. And then the second thing, which I think we all missed is, most of the recharging is going to happen at home. So there's millions of charge points that we're not in the business today. We only do stuff at gas stations. And so, to me, those are the 2 things where you go, "Oh my God, most of the recharging is going to happen at home and it's got to be measured and reimbursed. So who's going to do it?" 
 So I just discovered from the math that Chuck ran through, I just want to stick those concepts in people's heads that it is different than all of us thought coming into the thing. There's more money helping businesses in this thing, and it's going to cost them more than they think when they think about their golf cards. 
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. 
James Faucette: I wanted to kind of follow up on that question and just ask on these minority investments that you've made, I think, at least in my mind, the case to be made for managing those expenses and the costs associated with it, as you just highlighted are probably more significant than people may have imagined. 
 But can you talk about strategically why -- or under what conditions you do the minority investment versus acquisition, what you're expecting that to lead to down the road, and how we should think about that trajectory of relationships and potential contribution directly to FLEETCOR? 
Ronald F. Clarke: James, hey, it's Ron. It's a good question. It's kind of "try before you buy". So the category is new. There's a couple of partners that we called out today that have been working on software pretty hard and stuff. So for us, it's kind of a no-brainer to be supportive to them, give them money to keep kind of bill. And we have, obviously, commercial agreements that state the economics and the roles of the 2 companies. And so we like it. 
 We kind of get -- some people have been working on it here in the U.S. and some people have been working on it in Europe. We integrated it into the stuff we have and off we go. We've got a product that works, and so we can focus on trying to sell those stuff, which is what those 2 partners are looking for. Honestly, to the extent the thing is a super big deal and we want to get more of the value chain, we would clearly look at other options and stuff down the road and obviously in other geographies. 
 But initially, we're super pleased with these partners. We screened a lot of them. We like the offerings that we have. And we're still in the mode that I said we can. We're still trying to learn exactly what the clients want and need and to make sure that the products, including the software, are dialed into that. So we didn't want to get out over our skis before we were clearer. 
James Faucette: That makes sense. And then just as a quick follow-up. You've talked a lot about the strength we're seeing in things like hotel and recovery in travel. Can you just give us a little bit of color on what we -- you saw as we went through the Omicron wave and where you're at on a run rate trajectory, if there was any impact there? Just trying to measure near-term sensitivity to recent events. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Another good question. I'd say a smidge. We, Chuck and I, obviously did a reconnaissance of January with our folks, and I think we had a bit more in Europe, again. Exiting December and a bit into January, I'd say, it's a pretty soft month change for us anyway. So a smidgy impact. Obviously, we've rolled that into our guidance yesterday. We've had our eyes open the whole time. And I'd say the most recent stop, call it, the last week or 2 that smidgy thing is kind of going away. 
 So it's -- I don't want to get over my hopes easier, but it's sure feeling like we're coming out a bit into a clearing, finally. And again, I just want to reaffirm that the forward numbers we've given for '22, we're pretty confident sitting here, beginning of February. 
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. This concludes today's conference, and you may... 
James Eglseder: Hey, Alex, can we make just a quick comment? We just want to apologize to those on the call for the technical whiteout. Hopefully, it wasn't super confusing. So as always, appreciate the interest and the support. 
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-11-03 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings. Welcome to the FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call.
  [Operator Instructions] 
 Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Jim Eglseder, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. 
James Eglseder: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our third quarter 2021 earnings call. With me today are Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO; and Charles Freund, our CFO.  
 Following the prepared comments, the operator will announce that queue will open for the Q&A session. It is only then that you can get in line for questions. Please note, our earnings release and supplement can be found under the Investor Relations section of our website at fleetcor.com.  
 Now throughout this call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than non-GAAP information at other companies. Reconciliation of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today's press release and on our website as previously described.  
 I do need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today may include forward-looking statements. These statements reflect the best information we have as of today. All statements about our recovery, outlook, new products and acquisitions and expectations regarding business development and future acquisitions are based on that information. They are not guarantees of future performance, and you should not put undue reliance upon them. We do not undertake any obligation to update any of these statements. These expected results are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release and on Form 8-K and in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Committee. These documents are available on our website and at sec.gov.  
 So with that out of the way, I will turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay, Jim, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q3 earnings call. So up-front here, I'd like to run through 4 subjects: first, I'll give you my take on our Q3 results  along with the rest of your outlook; second, take you into a bit deeper dive into our sales results; third, give you an update on the 3 acquisitions that we've completed year-to-date; and then lastly, an early preview of 2022 and beyond.  
 All right. So let me make the turn to our Q3 results. We reported Q3 revenue of $755 million, up 29% and cash EPS of $3.52, up 25%, so both of those all-time record highs for the company. Also, the Q3 results annualized, finally above $3 billion, so past the $3 billion mark in revenue and $14 in cash EPS. Organic revenue for the quarter, up 17%. And inside of that, Corporate Payments business grew 22% organically.  
 The trends in Q3 are quite good. Sales finishing at record levels, up over 50% versus Q3 last year and over 30% against the baseline of Q3 '19. Retention, steady as she goes at 93% for the quarter. And again, our global fuel card business inside of that also coming at 93%. Same-store sales strengthened plus 5% for the quarter, which further adds to the same-store sales rebound we saw in Q2. Credit losses low again at 3 basis points, continuing to run below historic levels. You may notice our tax rate kind of 4 points higher than last year. That did shave about $0.20 off the $3.52 that we reported for the quarter. So look, overall, kind of pretty pleased with the quarter.  
 So in terms of rest of the year, we're raising guidance today. So revenue guidance at the midpoint now, $2.795 billion, that's up $30 million from August. Cash EPS at the midpoint to $13.05, that's up $0.15 from August. This raise versus last time reflects, obviously, these Q3 results are beat the ALE acquisition, which closed September 1 and a bit more favorable fuel prices, all of those offset just a bit by slower-than-planned COVID recovery. If you look at the Q4 on its own, it anticipates revenue and profit growth up about 20% versus Q4 last year and about 10% against Q4 2019.  
 All right. Let me make the transition into a bit deeper dive into our sales results. So as I mentioned, new sales or bookings reached record levels in the quarter and are up sequentially, significantly and up dramatically over the prior periods. So as I'm sure you're aware, sales reflect the market demand for our solutions but are also really the best leading indicator of future prospects. And so crazy record this quarter. We signed up almost 50,000 new business clients globally in Q3. So 50,000 new accounts joined the fold, so a record.  
 Over 50% of all of our global fuel card sales now come to us through our digital channels. So great because it's very low cost. We continue to increase our digital advertising spend, and we're enjoying record levels of prospects visiting our websites. Interest in EV solutions increasing, so a number of large accounts signing on to our EV solution. So that included Hertz, Volkswagen USA, Union Pacific, LeasePlan Europe and Siemens.  
 Brazil toll sales rocked in the quarter. Our urban sales or kind of the city dwellers that are lower frequency toll users represented 23% of all new sales in the quarter. So programs, whatever, 2 or 3 years old now, almost a quarter. And the active tags for the quarter reached a new milestone, 6 million, so 6 million active paying tags now in Brazil. We are planning to launch our new bank JV this month with the largest bank in Brazil, who will be helping to promote our products.  
 We don't talk about it much, but our customer acquisition cost is really quite attractive, runs about 65% of the sales new revenue, so really super important for profitable growth. So let me shift gears and talk a little bit about the 3 acquisitions that we've closed year-to-date and how they're doing. So Roger, first up. We've now rebranded Roger to be Corpay One, which is our entry into the Corporate Payments SMB space. So we're underway now adding new SMB bill pay clients through digital channels and accounting channels, and have some early returns on cross-selling bill pay into our fuel card base. So super early, but it looks like about 10% of our fuel card clients that pay their bills with our new Corpay One platform are choosing to pay a second non-fleet Cor bill with us, so effectively becoming bill pay customers.  
 We're looking at somewhere around 10,000 to 20,000 SMB bill pay clients coming online in 2022. And also interesting, we plan to launch what we call our 2-in-1 solution before year-end that will combine our smart business cards with our bill pay platform into one interface. So an SMB client could potentially pay all of their nonpayroll expenses with us on a single platform.  
 Second deal this year, AFEX, which is a cross-border provide, very similar to our Cambridge business. Super performance in '21. Pro forma revenue growing mid-teens. EBITDA up almost 50% versus prior year. Well along on integration, we've already combined the management teams into one group, and are about halfway through migrating the AFEX customers onto the Cambridge IT platform. So I hope to retire most of the AFEX IT system by year-end.  
 Last deal up is ALE. That's the lodging extension for the insurance vertical. It helps homeowner insurance place policyholders into hotels and temporary housing. So we closed at September 1 about 3.5 million incremental annual hotel rooms, will be added to our lodging business. Underway with the synergy work. And early view is about $0.20 accretive to 2022. So, so far, so good really across all 3 transactions this year.  
 All right. So lastly, let me share our view, early view of 2022, and speak a little bit to the beyond '22 prospects for the company. So for next year, encouraged by a few things. First, the run rate, we're exiting '21 with about $3 billion of annualized revenue and $14 of cash EPS. So nose of the plane is up. Sales again, running at record levels, which will drive incremental revenue into '22. We also expect sales to grow again next year about 20%.  
 Macro is on our side, helping us. Obviously, fuel prices are high. FX is generally holding, so setting up well there. And then I mentioned the acquisitions, particularly AFEX and ALE, together contributing probably about $0.50 of incremental accretion next year. So look, taken together, the early 2022 set up is quite good.  
 If we look just a little farther out into the midterm, we're kind of also encouraged there for a couple of reasons. So first, we've expanded, via our Beyond strategy, the market segments or the served market segments in each of our 5 major lines of business. So that's laid out on, I think, Page 14 of the earnings supplement. So for example, in Corpay, our Corporate Payments business, we've added cloud-based AP solutions to our original virtual card business. So we did that a couple of years ago in the middle market with Nvoicepay, and then obviously, this year, in the SMB market with Roger. So look, much, much better positioned now to attack the Corporate Payments TAM.  
 And then again, if you look at our lodging business initially focused only on workforce or blue collar travelers going to economy hotels. Since we've added 2 new segments, the airline crew business and now the insurance policyholder business of the fold, that really triples the opportunity in terms of room nights for the lodging business.  
 A second thing is we're on a path, as I mentioned, to combine our card business with our payables business into a single platform, which would do two things: first, give us differentiation in the marketplace, where we can help clients pay all their nonpayroll expenses with us, both walk-around purchases and supplier payables from a single account; and second, could help us turn our fuel card business into a Corporate Payments business by cross-selling our bill pay services to our hundreds of thousands of fuel card clients. So as I mentioned, underway there. So look, the combination of expanding our served market segments in our existing 5 businesses along with this idea of joining up our cards and bill pay onto a single platform is encouraging for us.  
 So look, in closing, just a few final wrap-up thoughts. So again, a really good quarter, record revenue and profits for Q3, good trends, same-store sales up -- sales -- new sales up and retention steady, again, record sales and very attractive cost of acquisition of new accounts. 3 acquisitions on track against our thesis, and our early '22 set up attractive. So look, all-in-all, it feels like we're in a pretty good place.  
 So with that, let me turn the call back over to Chuck to provide some additional details on the quarter. Chuck? 
Charles Freund: Thanks, Ron. I'm delighted to share with you some more color on a very solid clean quarter. For Q3 of 2021, we reported revenue of $755 million, up 29%; GAAP net income of $234 million, up 24%; and GAAP net income per diluted share of $2.80, up 28%. Adjusted net income for the quarter, or ANI, increased 22% to $294 million or roughly $1.2 billion annualized. ANI per diluted share increased 25% to $3.52.  
 Organic revenue growth was 17%, driven by continued strong sales, solid retention levels and same-store sales recovery. Looking at organic growth across product categories. Corporate Payments was up 22% in the third quarter, highlighted by full AP, which grew over 50% again this quarter. Corpay One, our small business-focused full AP offering, grew 78%. So our full AP solutions continue to sell well in the market.  
 Cross-border revenue was up 19%, which showed some softness from the lockdowns down under in Australia. We do believe much of this softness is recoverable, but the timing is hard to predict. The AFEX integration is progressing quite well, and we've converted more than half of its customers onto our existing cross-border payment systems. We expect to convert the remaining customers before year-end. I'd like to thank our cross-border team as they've worked tirelessly to complete these customer migrations seamlessly, while simultaneously operating a growing, thriving business.  
 And within B2B, a lot of attention has been paid to new small entrants, several of which we enable with our partner program using our best-in-class virtual card. The partners we enable own the customer relationship, do the marketing and take the credit risk, so they keep most of the economics. We're more of a processor to them. So our take rate is meaningfully lower than when we go direct to customers, which is really where we tend to focus most of our sales and marketing efforts. So while these partners drive some volume growth, they still only represent about 13% of our Corporate Payments revenue.  
 Fuel was up organically 13% year-over-year, with strong retention trends and record digital sales continuing to drive the performance. We're seeing some softness in same-store sales as Australia, New Zealand and parts of Continental Europe are still grappling with COVID-related lockdowns, and over-the-road trucking is facing the driver supply shortage that's been all over the news. But despite these headwinds, our fuel businesses continued to grow in every geography as a result of our sales efforts and strong retention rates.  
 Tolls was up 14% compared with last year and showed impressive performance again this quarter, growing to above 6 million total tag holders, with 5 million consumer tags and 1 million business tags. Now just for context, the business had approximately 4.5 million total tag holders when we acquired it back in 2016.  
 Economic and business activity has returned to relatively normal levels in Brazil, which has increased customer mobility and sales traffic through retail and toll locations, helping us to achieve record Q3 sales. Lodging was particularly strong, up 40%, with airline lodging up 61% on the back of the recovery in domestic air travel. We hope to see more recovery in international airline lodging as borders reopen. Gift organic growth was 25% year-over-year, benefiting from continued retailer embrace of the online sales channel.  
 Now looking further down the income statement. Operating expenses were up 30% to $417 million and were 55% of revenue, stable with last year. The increase was primarily due to higher levels of business activity, the effect of currency translation impact on international expenses and acquisitions. Interest expense decreased 7% to $29 million, primarily due to higher interest income earned on cash balances and lower LIBOR rates more than offsetting higher debt and securitization balances.  
 As Ron mentioned, our effective tax rate for the third quarter was higher than expected, coming in at 24.1%. This was due to fewer stock option exercises during the quarter likely due to the low share price, which resulted in minimal excess tax benefits. We currently expect our tax rate in Q4 to be back within our full year guidance range.  
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of unrestricted cash, and we also had approximately $650 million of undrawn availability on our revolver. In total, we had $4.6 billion outstanding on our credit facilities and $1.1 billion borrowed on our securitization facility. As of September 30, our leverage ratio was 2.76x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement.  
 We used $406 million to repurchase approximately 1.6 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $260 per share. We still have $1.18 billion of share buyback capacity in our program. So far this year, we've bought back 3.1 million shares and we've closed 3 deals, putting $1.7 billion of capital to work. On top of that, we still have low leverage and ample liquidity for additional deals and/or buybacks, clearly demonstrating the earnings power and attractiveness of our high-margin, high-cash flow business.  
 Looking ahead, I would note that you can see our full updated guidance and assumptions in both our press release and supplement. But before we open it up for questions, I would like to inform you that at the most recent Board meeting, FLEETCOR adopted the Rooney Rule for all future Board positions. I would also like to mention that we expect to publish our latest ESG report to our Investor Relations website within the next few weeks, and we'd be happy to take your feedback on our ESG efforts after you've had a chance to review that report.  
 With that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]
 Our first question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. 
Darrin Peller: Look, it's great to see the macro recovery and you guys benefiting there as well as the initiatives you've made, especially on the Corpay side. And I just want to hone in on that segment, primarily, given all the acquisitions and the rebranding and the efforts on sales focused on really software now. So can you just touch on that in terms of what the different assets are going to contribute where you saw the opportunity for growth most profound in the next few quarters? 
 And then maybe just quickly, I saw in the quarter, we're hoping for a little more acceleration now, but I think some of this may just be coming over time as the sales free navigates its focus. But can you just touch on the current trends? I think it decelerated on a 2-year stack a little bit, but what it could be going forward? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Darrin, it's Ron here. We're pretty happy with it. I'd say, the sales continued to remain quite good in the corporate pay segment. And of the 3 areas, our direct business where we go to end clients and our FX business, cross-border business, super good growth in Q3. I think one was the direct business, was 30%. I think it's in the earnings supplement, and the cross-border, I think, high teens [ 19 ]  all the while we're digesting that AFEX acquisitions are pretty busy on that. So I think those two pieces are of the business. And so they're growing good. The sales are good. To your point, if we get any COVID recovery, there's still some fair amount to get back next year. We're -- I think we're bullish. I think our early view, again, is high teens for that segment for '22. 
Darrin Peller: Okay. That's really helpful. And I mean, just Ron, this is -- should we think about it being much more of a software-focused approach going forward in terms of sales versus more pure-play virtual card, I guess, more rolling together all the assets? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. So that's a great question. Yes, we started that. I think a couple of years ago, we bought kind of the full AP software front-end and plug it into our back-end execution stuff. And so we've moved the mix, Darrin, dramatically here in 2021. So we're selling, I don't know, I think almost [indiscernible] what we call full AP where we take 100% of the clients' payables versus virtual card. But obviously, the great news is it's still all virtual guard, right?  
 When we sell that, full AP, underneath that, basically is the same engine to your point, the same merchant database, the same ability to earn interchange, if you will, on that portion. So it sells better. We think it has more value to the client. We generally retain more of the economics there and yet we still have a bunch of virtual cards. So you'll see more of that. I think we'll probably move even more of the business as you roll forward that way. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with Truist. 
Andrew Jeffrey: Ron, the commentary on the digital go-to-market, I think, is particularly intriguing. Can you talk a little bit about what the LTV to CAC looks like in your fuel business? I think you said 50% of the sales are going through digital channels. And how we might expect that to inform your consolidated profitability over time? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I think the call out, Andrew, was for our whole global -- our entire sales for Q3, we run around 65%, okay? So some businesses are better than that. Obviously, some are worse, and same with channels. So it's referencing that the digital channel, which is growing as a percent, is lower than that 65% line average. So the good news is as the mix of our total sales moves more and more to digital, that should improve basically our cost of acquisition. And so, obviously, we're delighted that more and more of the business is moving there.  
 And then second thing I'd say about that is things that are less dependent on people, right, hiring, training and retaining lots of people, slows company's ability right to staff and grow that way. So on the digital side, we're getting pretty good at increasing digital advertising spend now and seeing the payback in terms of visitors and flow through to conversions. So that's something that we can step on a bit faster and get returns faster. So I'd say this whole shift basically to digital sets up super well.  
 As it relates to the corporate pay economics long term, I think you're right. I mean, I think the big, big idea we have is we've got this giant fuel card client base. I don't know, 500,000, I think, or more active clients. And they generally are small, right? We get a couple thousand in revenues. We don't get a lot from them. So the idea of being able to go to that group and cross-sell them something else that has the same or more value, obviously, could accelerate revenue growth, but to your point, it's a way lower cost of acquisition than prospecting for new business, like going back to all the UIs and all the ways that we talk to our existing clients. So now when I say it's super early, we just started, but that would have an opportunity one, to make our fuel card business and the synergy, the assets of 20 years of building that payout. And then second, drive again the cost of acquisition down if that cross-sell component becomes big. 
Charles Freund: Andrew, I can clarify this. This is Charles. I'd just like to clarify Ron's comment regarding 65% in terms of an acquisition cost. We define that as what we call NSC or net sales expense. It's basically cost of acquisition divided by the annual revenue from that client for prospect. So if I -- if someone is going to generate 1,000 on revenue for me annually and cost me $650 to acquire that account, that's the 65% metric that we use internally. 
Andrew Jeffrey: Okay. And how does that compare to the traditional sales channels? 
Charles Freund: I'd say that we've been fairly stable through time. Some of it does shift as you have more field-based selling. But in the main, we've been around 50%, 60% for years. 
Ronald F. Clarke: And, Andrew, I love with the spotlight on it because lots of other people spend lots of money. They generate some sales, but you can't ever make a return, right? So if you sell $100 million and spend $65 million, you're underwater on the first year. But then you've got, call it, $90 million of the $100 million you sold the second year with 80% flow through, you got $80 million flowing through for 8 more years with no sales expense. So that's the key to profitability in our kind of business is basically this acquisition cost and the retention rate. So we call it out because that's how the business actually makes money. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Pete Christiansen with Citi. 
Peter Christiansen: Nice results. Just wanted to dig a little bit into the lodging business this quarter. I know there was a bunch of natural disasters in the last couple of months, wildfires, Ida, so on and so forth. Just wondering, to what degree that was a contribution factor to some of the outsized growth in lodging? How should we think about the ALE business during periods of natural disasters? How does that business, I guess, from a revenue perspective, how should we think about it ranging in these types of periods? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Pete, thanks for the question. It's Ron. So in the first part of the question, hey, how did bad weather and stuff help the lodging business some is Q3? Some is the answer. So we picked up some decent amount of incremental volume when that happens kind of almost unexpected volume, but the rate on that is like super-duper low. We sign up with contracts with people like FEMA and stuff. And so lots of volume and a little bit of revenue contribution.  
 On the ALE side, I'd say, it helps again a little bit. The diligence that we did in that business is surprisingly over incredibly long cycle. I don't know, 90% plus, I guess, over the 5 or 10 years we looked at is not hurricane or natural disaster-related. It's your pipe ranks and your house floods, and you left the candle on of the bathroom and the house burned down. And so it's what we think of as just way more common kind of every day, which is why we went ahead with the business. It's just way more ratably, you take all the hundreds of millions of homes or apartments. Stuff goes wrong, with them that displaces people. And so that business, obviously, it's insurance, so the statistics on it are pretty good. So I'd say for both businesses, it helps really just at the margin. 
Peter Christiansen: That's helpful. And then your comments on the fuel card business seeing a little bit of incremental softness, which is understandable what's going on abroad in some areas. But I was just wondering if you could characterize the competitive market perhaps for larger fleet type deals and how that's kind of evolving, I guess, as we come out of COVID. Are you seeing competition intensify? Or are there big opportunities ahead? Do you think -- just wondering if you could put a frame on that. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I'd say probably if anything, it's lessened during COVID. I mean I think we've called out for at least a few quarters now the overall fuel card retention rate, which is up. I think it's up -- I don't have it in front of me, but it's certainly up dramatically in the last couple of years versus where it was a couple of years ago. And I think I called out that it remained at 93% for the quarter. And so I would say, the COVID basically people shifted to other priorities, and doing RFPs for fuel cards probably wasn't the top one.  
 So the other thing I'd say, because I think it's missed is, the real competition for us. We study wins and losses in fuel cards. So where do we get the 35,000 new accounts that came on board this quarter and where the 10,000 that we lost? And the answer is not our friends WEX. It's basically business cards and other forms of payment, both in business cards, for example. So that's -- so the real competition for us globally in the fuel card business is really other means of payment. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. 
Ramsey El-Assal: I wanted to ask about the new sales bookings growth, which was an impressive number. Was this the result of any kind of changes you've made in your approach in terms of the sales organization, or -- and also, could you help us think through, or maybe even remind us of the algorithm by which those bookings will eventually convert to revenue, maybe something about timing, or how that actually operates? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Ramsey. So we agree. I tried to put a bit of a spotlight on it for the quarter because it's in record territory, right? There weren't 50,000 accounts when I started with the platform 20 years ago. So to sign up 50,000 new businesses in a quarter is good. And then second, against the '19 baseline, I think I called out our bookings dollars were up 30%. So forget the weak comp against the normal quarter. A couple of years ago, it's way up. So the headline is our company sales were way up, that's headline 1. 
 And Part B is so why they weigh up? I think it's the location we made into digital, So start, I don't know, 4 or 5 years ago, we did a bunch of things to get way better at digital marketing and selling, obviously, not the least of which is the whole tech stack that we build to be able to follow businesses and everywhere they crawl around and then what they do to advertising, figuring out where to spend and who to target money against to get them to visit our sites to optimizing our sites to get conversion rates and sales at the bottom end to applications going end-to-end where someone could go on our site and literally order the program and get cards in a couple of days and not have to talk to people.  
 So the reengineering, I'd say, of the whole digital machinery has been, first of all, it was massive, but we're getting the returns of it now. It's obviously ramped way the heck up. And I think it's another huge step-up in our early plans for '22. So I would say that's the main, main driver, and we're doing that everywhere. We're just way smarter in how we target and how we study where prospects go and what they're looking at instead of trying to make up who we think might be interested in our products.  
 So on your second question on bookings, the answer to it is, let's say, we said, hey, we sold, pick a number, $100 million of new business in this core. To Chuck's point, what that means is as you roll forward and that all gets implemented, it's obviously an annualized amount of $100 million. It wouldn't be $100 million in this year, like we sold it throughout the year, it'd be $50 million, for example, in that case. And so we have very different timings.  
 In our Brazil business, we sell, and it's almost instamatic. In our fuel card business, we sell and we get it pretty soon. In our Corporate Payments business, which are bigger accounts, it takes longer. So our -- we basically know our sales, if you will, our new business for '22 because it's all sitting in our pipeline to be implemented. So the bookings number turns into an annualized revenue number, which is how we build our plans, and then the timing or what we call the in-year amount varies across the various businesses we have.  
 But the main thing I want to make sure people are clear is it's working. I don't want to get lost in the details here that the company, our company, is selling more of everything than it's ever sold before ever. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Great. It sounds like it's not a fluke but by design, so encouraging. Ron, I wanted to ask you about your new compensation contract, which is structured in more of pay-for-performance kind of style. Can you talk about why you pivoted in that direction in terms of structuring your comp, and sort of what gives you confidence about hitting those sort of future hurdle rates? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, that's interesting question. I'd say basically that the first 10 years of the company's life was in a PE form with the alignment between investors and managers were super clear. If value gets created, the proceeds get split versus this kind of, "Hey, I just give you money for showing up." And so it's in kind of the DNA. I like it. I like it, the people that put capital in alongside of me get returns, and I give returns. And if we don't, we don't. And obviously, there's more leverage than that. I've got, as you know, a lot of money. And so getting some money with our current tax structure is not super interesting. So it's a motivating way to keep me at the grindstone for a couple of years here to try to get the thing to a place.  
 And how do I feel about the confidence other than the way people rate our stock? I feel good. We have models that come off of the sales and retention math that we run all the time for your models, and I see what the revenue and cash EPS looks like running through our machine. And if it's valued fairly reasonably, it gets to those targets that are there. So I look at it and go -- if someone priced our earnings reasonably, I think we can make the targets and then I could get paid. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. 
Mihir Bhatia: Maybe just to start, I just wanted to ask about the gift card business. Given all we're hearing about supply chain issues, could that be a tailwind in 4Q? Maybe a little bit of a unique opportunity there. Anything you're hearing if you could just talk about that? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Mihir, it's Ron again. So yes, there are a bit on the card side and just the retailers ordering cycle. So I would say it looks kind of like it's going to come in on our plan, just talking to our gift head not long ago. But I'd say the upside for us is probably not so much that, that the card orders would go up. It's really -- finally, the guy running it, and we finally found a way to grow the business. So -- and how long we followed our company, but I've been trying to sell a business since I bought it. And all the guys turned it into a business now that we think that can compound a double digit. 
 So the way they've done it is instead of just being an administrator, an accountant for the Macy's gift card and count them $100 down, they help our clients now sell online. So they've moved over to helping sell online digital gift cards because they know a lot about it. They're getting paid extra for wallet provisioning. Half the gift cards, there's breakage where people can't find them anymore. They're in a drawer. 
 And so super technically hard to move private label cards into wallets, but our guys came up with a way to do it. So we get paid money from a number of the brands to basically provision those electronically. And then the guy came up with the idea of selling the content. We have, I don't know, 300 or 400 pretty good brands. So we're taking them back to businesses because we're in the B2B business. So they've built a bit of a revenue and sales stream now taking them for rewards like companies like ours, for example, for employees.  
 So these 2 or 3 new ideas on top of the kind of old chugging along kind of low single-digit business has propped that thing up now to being north of 10%. So -- and I went through the guys plan a couple of weeks ago. So I think finally have a set of ideas that are more sustainable to keep growing that business now. 
Mihir Bhatia: All right. Great. And then If I could ask about the, just about Brazil. You mentioned things are getting back to normal there. You've obviously had very good momentum in selling more tags. So is there an argument there that you might see a little bit of an exponential step-function growth in the revenues per tag? Because those are still meaningfully below like where you were in 2019, and you've obviously added a lot of capabilities where you can use those tags too. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, that must be -- you're looking, I think, at the FX. So we're way the heck up. The sales there in constant currency in real are way, way up. I don't have it in front of me versus '19. Chuck is going to pull it out, but these should record levels. Whatever we sold in Q3 would have been an all-time record number of sales. And what I said about the recovery is Brazil is in a complete ditch COVID-wise in the spring and into the summer, and somehow has come out the other side. They are in a better price than we are here. 
 So what that's done is it's opened the stores there where we sell a lot. We have kiosks and hundreds and hundreds of stores. So stores are open. People are walking. Mobility's back and more people are running through the tolls where we also sell. So the place is basically where we conduct business to try to make sales are kind of reactivated again, which is helping drive it.  
 And then second, I think we said before, we've come up with a number of super new partner or channel ideas there. The newest one is we've got a couple of the big car manufacturers to put the tags now on the vehicles. So when you go in and get your new Volkswagen and drive it out of the dealership there, you look up and there's a sticker already there with a little POS thing that says, "Hey, call this number go to this website." We're getting like 50% or something conversion on adoption of these new vehicles rolling out of the dealership. So it's really -- I can't even tell you how good of a sales story that team has put together.  
 But the -- as you said, the big, big idea for us and we poured a lot of capital into it this year in '21 is to double or triple the fueling locations, and the fueling transactions are up huge over a year ago now as we take the 6 million vehicles. So we had tags and given more places to use the tags. So that is the one said to me, where could the free money and real acceleration come. It could come from this massive group of people basically just having more places to use the tag and the accounts already on their vehicle. 
Mihir Bhatia: And you get paid per transaction, right? 
Ronald F. Clarke: We get paid MDR pretty attractive MDR on the fueling in that example, yes. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: I wanted to talk about the partner channel Corporate Payments mix that Charles touched on. When we think about that 13%, 14%, is this a higher profitability contribution because your partners are sort of bearing the expense?  
 And then as we think about how that percentage is going to migrate over time, do you expect that to go up or down, or is there -- how long are those partners committed to? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. So it's Ron. Let me start with the second part. So we probably have, I don't know, 15 significant kinds of partners in that Corporate Payments group called top 3 or 4 most important, another 8 or 10. And so the contracts generally would run anywhere from probably 3 to 5 Years. We just renewed actually a couple of them with some of our most important partners this year.  
 In terms of what do I think I'd say down would be my answer. So if you look at -- I think we put, Jim, a slide in the earnings supplement. I think it's Page 15, Sanjay, but I think that's positive. Yes, it takes the 3 pieces of our Corporate Payments business, the partner thing that we're talking about and then the direct business where we go to the end client and then the cross-border business where we mostly go to the end client. So you can see that those two are growing revenue much faster. And so the mix itself, if you just run the clock forward would make the partner piece smaller, I think, going forward.  
 So obviously, there's lot of spend there and spend grows fast. But to your point, they do more of the work. So obviously, our rates are much, much lower there than in the direct business. So we like the business, but obviously, 90% of our Corporate Payments business is in the directed cross-border. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Okay. I guess, obviously, the chatter out there is you have a lot of these fintechs that are competing against you and with you. And I'm just curious, as we think about FLEETCOR's competitive edge, I know, Ron, you talked about how you're putting the acquisitions together to deliver a powerful punch. But I mean do you feel like there's -- the competitive intensity has increased in that market and your -- or that you widened your moat in that market? I'm just curious to just get a little bit more color on that because that's obviously been a hot topic of discussion. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I think it's a super good question. I think obviously, there's more people trying to get into entire processing, whether it's virtual or just traditional physical cards. So I think, first off, that a lot of the players that get into are issue for issuing kinds of companies that are in that business, right, for FIs and for us, but yes, some of them are coming into our area.  
 What I'd say back is fallacy is somehow that the game is tech and product to the X, Y, Z fintech has some great thing not old fashion FLEETCOR out of it. And what I'd say to you is what they're missing is it's the merchant network, you can't monetize virtual cards if you don't have a virtual card merchant network that can process and capture those transactions you can profit until the day goes on, but you have to have the network. So we've had a, call it, I don't know, a 10-year head start on everybody in cleansing, building, growing that network.  
 And then the second one is the whole service dimension of a huge pay for you group, a massive group that helps the partners clean up the data and get the stuff processed. So I'd say those would be the couple of components that people missed that this isn't just making a new processing engine in the garage and giving it to AWS, and that's all going to be great. There's actual real assets that we have that cause our partners to stay with us. I mean, there was a big thing. Some came into my office a year, 2 of your clients, Build.com and AVIDA brought on other providers. We're doing great with them. We've renewed the contract for a number of years with one of them. We're getting more business than ever from another. We're obviously we have a great relationship.  
 Some of those are targeted like the Marqeta thing, as an example, is targeted to FIs, which we're not even in. We're not in the processing business to help FIs. We thought they wouldn't use their own processes and stuff. And so I think like everything else, it's someone searching for some narrative that is in there. We've got a good business. It's growing. The spend is growing like crazy. But because we make so much more money on the direct businesses and a growing fast, that mix will cause the partner thing to be a bit smaller.  
 But I think we're still -- I'd tell you, go call our partners. Don't ask me the supplier. Go ask our partners that they like the job we're doing. I look at the performance reports. I send performance reviews with the partners, myself personally. So from my vantage point, we're doing quite well. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Suchoski with Autonomous. 
Kenneth Suchoski: I just wanted to dig into the fuel card business a little bit more. I mean, it looks like transactions came weaker than we were expecting, and I think you called out international and the driver shortage. But can you provide some detail there on where you're seeing that weakness on the transaction side? And what's your expectation around the recovery? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Ken, it's Ron. So yes, I'd say, there's good news and bad news. The good news is -- the bad news is, a, the transactions are a little weaker than we thought. The good news is they're not worth much.  
 So the two areas of weakness are in trucking, again, a particularly large trucking both here and in Europe. And you guys have read the press on this that the large trucking firms just don't have drivers. And not only are they not drivers, they're quitting and forming and going into smaller firms now. So our big accounts are effectively just soft in terms of trucks and transactions, but they're happy because they're just raising their rates.  
 And then the second one I'd say is really Europe and the big corporates, they are the white collar book of business where people haven't gone back to work in Europe. And I don't know if you guys know it's been in Europe, lots of people of company cars. So people like us have a car and we used to drive around and get reimbursed. So those are the two areas that are weak.  
 The good news is we don't get paid anything for those things. We don't get paid very much. So that's why our revenue growth is still pretty good. The local business, for example, in our partner business are super healthy, and even a big part of our U.K. business, which I'm looking at, had strong same-store sales recovery. So the areas where we get paid and we get revenue are actually pretty healthy. 
Kenneth Suchoski: Got it. That's really helpful. And maybe just my -- for my follow-up, I think on last quarter's call, you've provided some preliminary thoughts on '22. I think you talked about $14 in annualized EPS in the second half of this year. You have some interest rate hedges rolling off and then the contribution from AFEX and ALE. So lots of moving parts, but maybe you can frame for us how you're thinking about 2022. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, that's it's a good question. So the way, I mean, I say this all the time, if you like businesses, you can plan, you should like our business, it's the nature of the model. And so what we do is we -- which we're about halfway through, we build things off of run rate. So we're staring here at October volumes and revenues in all of our businesses. And I think what I said is, hey, when you post $3.52 or $3.50, we multiply it and we go, okay, that sounds like $14, and we guided to a number we don't have in front of me, Chuck, that's $3.50-something for Q4 is a track stuff. So there's another one. 
 So hey, we start with the company is running earning $14 on an annualized basis now. Then we sit there and say, "Okay, we had sales record levels this year, of which, call it, 2/3 of that will be realized in 2022 so we can see what that number is." Then we have a bigger sales plan for 2022, probably 20% higher, and we look at what's in here there. I'm like, "hey, that looks good".  
 And then we look at the deals that I mentioned that are kind of on top of that, which I think I called out together, call it, $0.50 would be kind of my commitment on the stuff that we use capital for. So that's how we build the math. We take the run rate, we take this year, next year sales. We take added things like the accretion of deals, and that helps us basically target a number that we can get to. And we haven't planned a heck of a lot of COVID recovery. Obviously, it's -- we're just obviously 12 months this year. And so we've been pretty conservative so far and getting some of that back. We still have probably $100 million, $150 million that could literally come back a different day potentially. And so those are the components.  
 And what I was trying to say -- and the other one is the macro. Obviously, fuel prices are higher here in November than they were in January and seem to be holding. And so when you roll all that up, my message is it looks super early, but it looks like a really good number. And the reason I go through all that math is to get people longer than us who are in the company some insight into how they ought to think about it. Things could happen, but the company is pretty well positioned to put up an attractive growth number for next year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. 
David Togut: In the Corporate Payments business, WEX reported a pretty substantial compression in revenue yield in the third quarter year-over-year. Can you comment on the revenue yield you're seeing in that business? And, a, is there any significant change? And are there any call-outs in verticals, i.e., kind of travel versus nontravel? 
Ronald F. Clarke: David, it's Ron. It's a good question. So I'd go back to the slide that Jim put in our earnings supplement. I think it's Page 15. So again, sitting inside, our Corporate Payments business, I think we report, what, 22% organic growth and, what, 50% or something, [ friends ], for the quarter? 
Charles Freund: 68%, I think. 
Ronald F. Clarke: 68%. So obviously, that's the overall number, David. But the pieces of that, again, are the direct or end-client business, the cross-border business and then this channel partner business. And so for us, the good news is the 2 big pieces, which are about 90% I'm looking at the thing are effectively flat. So because we price it, there's really no rate erosion in that out of our business. And so all of the rate erosion is really just in the mix of partners where we have tax table rates, and we have some partners that are growing like crazy. So as their volumes go up, they enjoy a bit better rates, right, in the base than the base rates. 
 And so because we don't have the same kind of reliance, if you will, on the channel business, I think we're a bit more insulated, if you will, from rate compression there. And I mentioned it earlier, I'd say the super positive thing is our mix of that business is going to more full AP. And don't forget, we bought an SMB company that has higher rates. So as we roll in the full AP, the Nvoicepay mix and this Corpay One mix, those have a way higher rate than the existing businesses. So my guess is just kicking out the channel business, I see actually rate expansion over the next couple of years in that business mostly help from mix. 
David Togut: Understood. That's very clear. Just as a quick follow-up. You commented earlier about the difficulty of finding drivers in this environment. Could you quantify for us what this means for your fuel card business in terms of revenue growth in 2022? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Again, I think the driver thing is a total trucking vertical, issue, David. I don't think it's -- we don't see it obviously as significantly in the trade businesses, right? Those people have to be trained and whatever they are. So we don't see the same kind of softness, if you will, of our existing customers in those kinds of businesses. And so -- and again, we see it mostly in the large account trucking business. be the other thing, which we don't make any money in either. 
 So I'd say that who knows? My guess is it's not a super easy fix for suddenly large trucking people to get the people, although you see the pictures of the at the ports of the need for more trucking. So my guess is there'll be more incentives and pressure to try to get more people into the space over the next 6 to 12 months. But I'd say it doesn't do much to us. One, it's limited only to that trucking vertical. Two, it's limited to the big firms, which don't pay as much. And, And three, honestly, it's kind of in our run rate. The softness has really been the year for the last couple of quarters. 
 And so I don't see it really getting any worse, mostly because of what I said that I think there's going to be such a push to try to add people. And I think the rates are going to keep going up to attract people. So I'd say it's probably not a super duper impact on our forward thinking for the few of our business. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Mihalos with Cowen. 
Georgios Mihalos: Ron, you talked a lot about some of the, I guess, hiring and wage pressures that are impacting the fuel side of the business. I'm just curious, as it relates to the Corporate Payments business, do you feel like that's been impacted at all by any supply chain issues at your customers, or has that come up at all your conversations with them? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, for sure. I mean, again, George, I'd say it's pocketed. When we go look, we have bigger customers there. And so some have come through this thing kind of unscathed and then others have had a big problem. So yes, we have a select group of clients that are kind of down and have stayed down. And I think the supply chain is a big part of it. 
Georgios Mihalos: Okay. That's helpful. I'm just curious to the extent, are you able to quantify that in any sort of capacity or give any sort of color around that? 
 And then maybe separately for a follow-up, the minimal credit losses that you're continuing to see, is that just a harbinger of just cleaner credit now, or do you feel that there is an opportunity to loosen credit standards even from here? Just curious how you're thinking about that. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. So let me take the first part, yes. We are one of the easiest things to quantify for us is to look at clients we have, let's say, clients 1 through 100 and look at their volumes and revenue in a prior period, let's say, 2019 or Q3 of 2019. And then, let's say, we still have those 100 clients to go look at their volume and revenue with us in Q3 of this year. So that's the stat we call same-store sales or the core client base. 
 So yes, we -- for Corporate Payments or every business, we turn that into a revenue number and say, okay, we're some, whatever, $20 million with clients that used to give us $20 million more 2 quarters ago than they do now. And hey, we watch them to see whether some of that $20 million is coming back. So we have super clear visibility on the amount of it and the rate of recovery of it. Is that one clear? 
Georgios Mihalos: Yes. Just curious, if you could sort of ballpark what that impact would be or if you're willing to ballpark what that impact would have been how much faster the growth would have been in the segment? 
Ronald F. Clarke: You want to say, Chuck, anything about that? 
Charles Freund: Yes, I think we look at those pocketed groups. So in Corporate Payments, the top 75 we last looked at it last month, the 75 most affected clients, their volume was still down about half of where it was back in January 2020. And so we looked at it just last month. So we continue to track it. But as Ron mentioned, it's highly pocketed in certain categories that just haven't quite reopened yet. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. It's about -- just to give you a percentage, it's about, I'd say 3% this quarter versus our plan. So hey, we guesstimated those 100 people would come back a certain way in Q3 from 2 years ago, and they came part of the way back. They come back to where we thought we'd at. That's 3 points more of growth in the things. So it's still a significant thing. And we'd be hopeful maybe we get it back and be kind of ready to get back a different day. 
 On your second question, the credit question, I'd say yes, yes and yes. It's a super good question. It's record lifetime lows of credit losses, first of all, because we didn't sell much new business, obviously, in 2020. So there wasn't a lot of new business coming on. And then between the stimulus and relief and everything else, people repaid us and stuff. 
 And so for sure, we've opened it up. I think Chuck said in the last call last time that we expect those losses to tick up. You can see it a bit in the roll rates, right, as we've onboarded a lot more business this year. Our Q4 losses will be a bit higher. 
 And we're actually doing that juggling question now for 2022. Okay, how much do we -- how open do we want to be in credit both with existing accounts in terms of credit lines? I mean think of this, I've got fuel cards to have some credit line and the credit line is enough to pay their fuel card bills. What do they tell me they want to pay all my bill -- the bills with payment. And I said, okay, I lease with our credit. 
 I mean our opportunity to increase credit to creditworthy people for our new products is like super high. And so I'd say we, for sure, will rebalance next year towards taking more risk certainly than this year and try to make that trade-off, right, between incremental sales and revenue growth and incremental losses. But we'll be careful. I want to make sure everyone on the call is clear, we're not crazy. We'll step our way in. We'll study our way in, but we will do more of it. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. 
Robert Napoli: So Ron, I mean, there's been a lot of questions asked and -- but just -- what business -- or what are you most excited about over the next few years? Which part of -- parts of your business do you see the most opportunity to maybe outperform, drive upside drive growth? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Bob, it's a great question. I'd say the most -- to me, the most exciting thing, which is coming mostly from the world out there is this synergy, this platform concept of bringing walk-around plastic, which is the business we've mostly been in with payable together. And so it's a way of trading, in our case, a massive synergy in these businesses we've built over 20 years of getting just way more out of them. 
 So I gave the example earlier, we're launching late this month or the beginning of December, the thing we call the 2-in-1, where a client that has a business card of ours or a fuel card could also pay bills with us, and literally, it would just be in one place. He could use our card and our credit to pay some of his bills. Obviously, we'd have access that it was bank account to fund the bills. His report would show all his walk-around purchases like it does now and will show all his payables, the vendors, the way it is now, and it would all be in one place. 
 And so that has the opportunity in joining up businesses that we have. That's what creates profit acceleration, right, where you don't have to go fish one at a time, right, for each new client, you can go back to this pretty gigantic customer base that we built and basically start to join it up and cross up that's useful to them. And the tech that we have now makes it look -- when you look at it, it's just stitched together now. 
 So I'd say, that's the -- again, I try to say the thing, I'm also excited, I know people, doubt me -- doubt us, but we got a lot of legs in the businesses we have on that page. We pitch this beyond thing, and we've added segments everywhere in all the businesses which are adding growth. So I'm obviously super happy about that. But this integration and joining up in synergy where the new guys that have some nice new shiny product, they don't have a 20-year customer base and spend, and they don't get 50,000. So I mean, most of all year, your guys had signed 50,000 clients in the quarter. So that's the super exciting thing is can we monetize this bigger business profitably, would be what I'd say is the super new opportunity for us. 
Robert Napoli: Great. And Charles, just how are you feeling, looking at margins, the ability to expand margins from here over the next few years? 
Charles Freund: Yes, Bob, I'd say that our model tends to be one where we try to grow top line 10-plus percent and get a little bit of expansion. I think that is a mindset we've had for a long time, and we'll continue on that path. So I'd say we'll increment our way kind of as we go. 
 With that said, we do make a little room for select investments, whether it's the digital sales that Ron mentioned. When we have opportunities to invest, we will make those investments. but always with a mindset that we'll continue to grow the bottom line a little bit faster than the top. 
Operator: At this time, we have reached the end of our allotted time for the call. Thank you, everybody, for joining today's conference. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-08-04 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings. Welcome to FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to Jim Eglseder, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. 
James Eglseder: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our second quarter 2021 earnings call. With me today are Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO; and Charles Freund, our CFO. Following the prepared comments, the operator will announce that the queue will open for the Q&A session. It is only then you that can get in the line for questions. Please note that our earnings release and supplement can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website at fleetcor.com.  
 Now throughout this call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than non-GAAP information at other companies. Reconciliations of historical non-GAAP information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today's press release and on our website as previously described.  
 I do need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today may include forward-looking statements. These statements reflect the best information we have as of today. All statements about our recovery, outlook, new products and acquisitions, expectations regarding business development and future acquisitions are based on that information. They are not guarantees of future performance, and you should not put undue reliance upon them. We do not undertake any obligation to update any of these statements. These expected results are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K and in our annual report on Form 10-K, both filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available on our website and at sec.gov.  
 Now with that out of the way, I will turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay, Jim. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q2 earnings call. Upfront here, I'll plan to cover 3 subjects. First, I'll share my perspective on our Q2 results, along with rest of year outlook. Second, I'll provide an update on our 2 newest acquisitions. And then lastly, I'll talk about our fuel card business, including our latest view on EV, along with a couple of innovative developments underway in that business.  
 Okay. Let me turn to our Q2 results. So very pleased to report outstanding Q2 financial results meaningfully above our internal expectations. We reported Q2 revenue of $667 million that's up 27% and cash EPS of $3.15, up 38%. Both our Q2 '21 revenue and cash EPS exceeded our Q2 '19 results, so finally moving past our pre-pandemic baseline. Organic revenue growth came in at 23% for the quarter, our full AP outsourcing platform segment up 53% versus Q2 last year.  
 The trends in the quarter are really quite good. Our same store sales metric improved to plus 18%, so hardness of 18%, many of the sectors in our client base recovering. Retention, record level, we reached nearly 94%, an all-time high since we've been reporting the metric. And interestingly, our global fuel card business reached 92% retention, also an all-time high. Credit losses remain very good, running at historic levels. And sales outstanding in the quarter finishing up almost 2x last year's Q2 and up 6% against 2019.  
 Okay. Let me transition to our view of the rest of the year. So today, we're raising guidance to $2.765 billion at the midpoint for full year revenue, raising cash EPS at the midpoint to $12.90. That's driven by our Q2 beat, the AFEX close and really the momentum that we have running into the second half. I do want to remind everyone we had previously guided to a pretty substantial second half sequential step-up already. As a reminder, cash EPS guidance up nearly $0.60 from the start of the year. So we opened the year at $12.30; today, $12.90, so obviously, better than we outlooked.  
 The second half guidance implies a few things. So first, the revenue growth will run about 20% ahead of last year and high single digits really above the second half 2019 baseline. So we are expecting the business to reach all-time highs again in both revenues and profits. Our Q4 EPS profit guidance implies nearly a $14 annualized cash EPS exit rate.  
 Okay. Let me transition now to an update on our recent acquisitions. So as a reminder, we closed AFEX, that's the add-on cross-border deal, on June 1. And then last week, we signed definitive documents to acquire ALE, which is a lodging provider to the insurance vertical.  
 So let me start with ALE, really a highly complementary add-on to our existing lodging business, and that company brings a whole set of specialized capabilities designed just to serve the insurance vertical. So we've got a pretty interesting synergy plan for that business and expect accelerated revenue and profit growth next year.  
 We're also well underway on our AFEX integration. We've already exited about $10 million of run rate payroll expense. We've implemented one unified cross-border management organization, and we've designed an IT consolidation plan to move to a single system. That will significantly reduce run rate IT and operations expense.  
 So look, both of these acquisitions, classic FLEET wheelhouse deals. We paid reasonable prices. They're extensions of our existing business, so we know them well. And both have very rich synergy opportunities. we're expecting the businesses to grow about 20% on the top on a pro forma basis next year and together deliver incremental cash EPS in 2022 in the $0.50 to $0.70 range, so big upside. So obviously, we are quite enthusiastic about the transactions.  
 All right. Let me shift gears now and talk a bit about our fuel card business, which we continue to love and which we think has a bright future. So I'll talk a bit about EV, the latest and greatest, and then talk about innovation and specifically 2 new things that we're doing to improve the growth prospects of our fuel card business.  
 So starting out with EV. I mentioned last time, we're really embracing EV as an opportunity and in no way see it putting an end to our fuel card business. Employers are going to need to reimburse employees for recharging electric vehicles much like they reimburse employees for refueling combustion engines. And I think you may find that it costs more to operate EV than people think.  
 We also think there'll be some new economics and that we've got an opportunity to achieve, very similar economics from EV measuring and reimbursing as we do from combustion engines. We've included a couple of EV exhibits in our Q2 earnings supplement. You'll see some comparisons of spend where the cost of public charging is about 70% of fossil fuel charging. And then because there's more attractive MDR rates, we believe that we can achieve pretty interesting revenue there as well.  
 In a nutshell, we expect the at-home software subscription fees to be pretty significant and augment a number of the other fees that we get in the revenue mix.  
 We are outlooking the commercial transition to EV to be slow, particularly here in the U.S., giving us ample time to build out our public charging network and implement recharging at home. We expect mixed fleets to be how things start out. So our incumbent position should give us quite an advantage in consolidating activity and data for our clients. So look, in conclusion, we're outlooking EV to really just be a different way to serve commercial fleets but one in which we think can still be attractive.  
 All right. Let me leave EV and cut over to the couple of innovations that we're working in the fuel card business. So first is digital and particularly digital selling, which now in Q2 has reached about 60% of all our new fuel card sales globally coming to us digitally. So lots of improvements in our digital selling capabilities. We've got automated keyword bidding now. We've redesigned our websites to maximize sales conversion, and we're beginning investments at the top of the funnel in the form of digital TV, radio, Facebook advertising, which is driving about 50% more visitors to our websites, so obviously leading to incremental sales.  
 The last innovation I'd like to touch on is our effort to transform our fuel card UI, which is used by over 100,000 clients, really into a broader payment platform. So we're combining our newest cloud-based SMB bill pay platform with our fuel card UI so that clients go on to pay us the fuel card bill that they'd have the option then of paying additional vendors with the same software platform. So this idea is really aimed at accelerating the number of active bill pay clients we can add to our platform and again beginning the transformation of the fuel card business into a corporate payments business. So we'll keep you updated there as we go.  
 So look, in closing, 3 thoughts for you. So one, on '21, again, we're pleased with Q2, particularly the record retention and record sales levels. And again, our second half outlook calls for new all-time highs again in revenue and profits. Second, on the fuel card business, again, we think the prospects are bright for the business. We do have a plan to monetize EV adoption by providing some new services and particularly measuring and reimbursing at-home recharging. We've got an opportunity to keep stepping up digital sales and digital advertising at the top of the funnel. We think we can drive incremental visitors and incremental sales. And we're launching a bill pay cross-sell opportunity to our fuel card clients again by turning our existing fuel UI into a broader payment platform.  
 And lastly, although early, we're quite encouraged by our 2022 setup. Our second half guidance calls for nearly $7 in cash EPS for the second half or approximately $14 annualized, again forecasting record sales for the full year, which will flow revenue into next year. Will roll off $1 billion in interest rate hedges in January. That will free up about $0.20 of incremental cash EPS. And lastly, our 2 newest acquisitions, hoping to contribute in the $0.50 to $0.70 range of incremental cash EPS. So look, taken together a lot to like about our 2022 setup.  
 So with that, let me turn the call back over to Chuck. He'll provide some additional details on the quarter. Chuck? 
Charles Freund: Thanks, Ron. I'm delighted to share with you the results of a very good quarter. For Q2 of 2021, we reported revenue of $667 million, up 27%; GAAP net income up 24% to $196 million; and GAAP net income per diluted share up 26% to $2.30. Adjusted net income for the quarter, or ANI, increased 36% to $268 million and ANI per diluted share increased 38% to $3.15 as we finally lapped the worst of COVID. Organic revenue growth improved 29 points sequentially to up 23% on a year-over-year basis, driven by strong sales, record retention levels and same-store sales recovery.  
 Looking at organic growth across the categories. Corporate payments was up 32% in the second quarter, led by our full AP solutions. We are seeing very good success leading with our full AP and selling a more complete package versus just a stand-alone virtual card offering. Full AP is clearly what we prefer to sell, so we've reoriented our combined sales force with this focus, and it's paying off.  
 T&E card revenue was up 58% year-over-year, rebounding significantly as business activity and travel began to resume. This T&E description is a bit of a misnomer as it's really a multipurpose card that can be used as either a purchasing card or as walk-around plastic, depending on how the customer wants to use it. And while spending within T&E-related categories has rebounded, it's still below historical levels. So there's clearly room for further improvement there.  
 Cross-border revenue was up 25%. These results do include 1 month of AFEX with pro forma results for Q2 last year, so which is if we owned it in both periods. And finally, virtual card revenue was up 13%. Both of these areas are still affected by COVID softness in industries that we've discussed before, like airlines, cruise operators, hotels and restaurants, international trade and commercial construction to a lesser extent. We do believe much of this softness is recoverable, but the timing is hard to predict.  
 Fuel was up organically 19% year-over-year with strong retention trends and record digital sales helping to drive the performance. We still see opportunities for further softness recoveries in fuel once the labor shortage affecting our large trucking fleet customer subsides and offices reopen more broadly so our white-collar commuters can return to normal activity levels.  
 Tolls was up 9% compared with last year and showed impressive performance in light of the lockdowns in place for much of the quarter. This growth was driven by record first half tag sales, demonstrating the value proposition and attractiveness of our offerings even when many folks aren't driving on the roads. And approximately 1/4 of all consumer tags sold year-to-date are signed up to urban plans, which allow purchases beyond tolls, such as for parking, fueling and fast food. We also added 25% more fuel stations to our tag acceptance network during the first half with plans to add another 50% during the second half. The combination of urban tag sales and non-toll network expansion should produce Beyond total volume growth as lockdowns ease and consumer activity increases.  
 Lodging was up 39%, with workforce up 36%. The pace of improvement in workforce lodging has leveled off some as customers are being held back by the labor shortage, but we feel this volume will come back over time as the labor market normalizes. Airline lodging was up 49% as domestic air travel recovered faster than expected but still remains below historical norms. International airline lodging should come back as international air travel recovers. So despite the sizable recovery in lodging, we still see upside potential here.  
 Gift organic growth was 22% year-over-year, benefiting from continued retailer embrace of the online sales channel. We expect this trend to continue as we are experiencing success with gift clients using our proprietary platform to sell both digital and physical cards online. In fact, we expect to double the number of clients utilizing this platform by year-end. Momentum in mobile wallet services and B2B sales, where third parties sell gift cards to companies for use as employee incentives and rewards, are also contributing to the improvement.  
 Looking further down the income statement. Our operating expenses were up 18% to $370 million, totaling 55% of revenue. The increase was primarily due to higher levels of business activity, the effect of currency translation impact on international expenses and acquisitions. We've also made incremental investments in digital sales and top-of-funnel marketing efforts and incurred some nonrecurring integration-related expenses for AFEX, such as severance and platform migration costs. Operating margins improved 4 points from last year to 45% due to recovering volumes that have higher margins, higher fuel prices and solid expense control.  
 In the quarter, bad debt was $6 million or 2 basis points. Credit performance continues to be strong, although we do expect our bad debt to normalize as our new sales improve and grow. Interest expense increased 7% to $34.7 million due to a $6.2 million charge associated with our debt refinance, a higher balance on the new Term B note partially offset by lower borrowings on our revolver and lower LIBOR rates on the unhedged portion of our debt. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 25.2%, similar to last year, and reflects a $6.5 million adjustment to our deferred tax position due to a rate change in the U.K. In our guidance, we are increasing our expected tax rate for the year given this adjustment and an assumed lower level of excess tax benefits on stock option exercises in the second half.  
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of unrestricted cash. We also had approximately $1.2 billion of undrawn availability on our revolver. In total, we had $4.1 billion outstanding on our credit facilities and $1 billion borrowed on our securitization facility. As of June 30, our leverage ratio was 2.62x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement.  
 We repurchased approximately 926,000 shares during the quarter for $246 million at an average price of $266 per share. The Board increased our share repurchase authorization by $1 billion on July 27, which now gives us $1.6 billion of share buyback capacity. Now even including the recent buybacks, the AFEX closing and the pending ALE deal, we still have low leverage and ample liquidity for additional deals and/or buybacks. Our high margin, high cash flow business, which generated $268 million of ANI this quarter quickly replenishes capital, allowing us to pursue attractive buying opportunities as they present themselves.  
 Now let me share some thoughts on our outlook. We are raising our full year revenue guidance to between $2.74 billion and $2.79 billion, which is up over $100 million at the midpoint. We are also raising our adjusted net income per diluted share guidance to between $12.80 and $13 or $12.90 at the midpoint. AFEX is a big contributor as is a better macro environment in addition to volumes that improved faster than we expected in the first half of the year. We continue to be encouraged by our strong sales and retention trends and currently expect COVID volume recovery to continue through the second half of the year. We are being mindful of the potential impact from the Delta variant, and we'll adjust our outlook and operations as necessary.  
 We are expecting Q3 2021 adjusted net income per diluted share to be in the range of $3.35 to $3.55.  
 You can see our full updated guidance and assumptions in our press release, so I won't reiterate them here. I would note that our guidance does not include the impact of the ALE acquisition that we just announced. We'll update for that when we actually close the transaction.  
 In closing, I'd like to thank my 8,000-plus FLEETCOR colleagues around the world who persevered through the pandemic, helped us return to growth this quarter and have positioned our company for a strong second half and beyond.  
 With that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Ron, I'm curious what surprised you in the second quarter in terms of -- sort of relative to your expectation as you looked at the strength. And I know, Charles, you just mentioned you guys are sort of anticipating the rebound to continue, but the second half guidance didn't go up a whole lot. Understandably, last quarter, you guys took up guidance. So I'm just trying to reconcile all of that, if you could just walk us through that. 
Operator: We are having technical difficulties. Please be patient while we fix the difficulties. Just one moment, please.  
 [Technical Difficulty] 
Ronald F. Clarke: Sanjay, it's Ron. I don't know if you can hear me now or not. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: I can hear you now. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay. Great, great. so what I was saying, where I cut out here, is no surprising sales, right? So I think we'd shown previously kind of the climb back, right, from a year ago where we were against the baseline. And so to basically post really a record number and really almost across the board, I'd say that's probably the most surprising, most positive thing.  
 And then the second thing, I guess, I'd say is just the ratability. Obviously, coming into this year, we were a little cautious, right? Should we give guidance? How well can we plan this business, et cetera. And so I'd say both this quarter and the first half, along with our outlook that we're -- that I'm surprised that basically, things are tracking as well or better kind of than the plan that we build. So that -- those would be the couple of things from me. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: And I guess, I'm sorry, just -- if we think about the second half, you guys aren't necessarily expecting that strength -- or that strength isn't outpacing your expectations. Is that because we're sort of putting in some more conservatism or something else? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. That's a good question. So I'd say a couple of things. So again, we have taken up the second half from 90 days ago. But more importantly, I think the sequential number was already up a lot, Sanjay, I think before we printed the number for Q2. I think I commented 90 days ago that our full year number had our Q4 revenue up, I think, $100 million from Q2. So that would be my second point that we're outlooking basically making $7 in the second half versus $6 off of a good quarter here. So it's still up, but we had already basically forecasted the thing to sequentially keep improving. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Got it, got it. And my final question, just -- I always ask this question, but just M&A pipeline. I know you guys took up the share buyback. Is that a reflection of the M&A pipeline or there's opportunities to do both? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. So I think I said in the last call, we always start with a pipeline. We have attractive things in front of us. And yes, we do. That's what caused us to refi the thing and take up our liquidity. So yes, I know I sound a bit like a broken record, but in front of me is our pipeline sheet. We've got 2 or 3 things close in that we're going to decide on and we've got another kind of 2 or 3 things that we may do before the year is over. So as always, we've got some interesting things.  
 And then second, we've -- I think we've got enough liquidity. I don't have it in front of me, but circa $1.5 billion to $2 billion. We're generating, what, $250 million a quarter. So that's another $500 million in the second half. So we've really got, for once, kind of plenty liquidity. Leverage ratio, I think, is in the mid-2s. So when you put it all together, I think we feel pretty able to do, Sanjay, virtually anything we want. 
Operator: Our next question is from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. 
James Faucette: I appreciate the color and commentary on the capital allocation and that kind of thing. I want to dig in a little bit on the... 
 [Technical Difficulty] 
Operator: We have lost his line. So we'll just move on until he redials in. Our next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: I hope you can hear me okay. I think maybe building on Sanjay's question around M&A. Just Ron, should the deals look similar to the -- as you called it, the classic 2 deals you guys closed here similar in terms of size and accretion? Or are some of these things perhaps bigger or smaller? I'm just trying to get a better sense of what you're seeing and what might be different. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Tien-Tsin, you can see if we don't like the questions, we just yank the guy off. So we're... 
Tien-Tsin Huang: A great strategy, a great strategy. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Thanks for your question. So I'd say looking at the thing in front of me, I think the difference is we've got kind of 2 flavors. We've got a couple of things that are similar to the AFEX and ALE. They're kind of more of what we do, where we like the prices and they're accretive. And then I'd say we've got a couple of things that are more adjacent. I think I called out a year ago this idea of kind of going up the value chain in corporate pay, like AP automation, as an example, kind of do more for the client between his ERP and our payments. So we've got a couple of things like that, that are not square in the categories but nest pretty close to them. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Okay. Good. That's fun -- it would be fun to see what it is. And then just on the new sales front, you said that was a nice surprise. How about in the second half? I mean do you feel like there's some pent-up demand as, let's hope, everyone sort of getting back to more normal order of business? Do you see that stepping up or maybe even more than a catch-up? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean that's also a good question. So yes, we did our kind of nice [ 93 to 10 T Box ] review halfway through the year review and the sales forecasts are in absolute numbers always higher in the back half. So we have forecast that are up in -- up even more against the 2019 baseline. And I did try to -- I know there's a lot of chitchat in these opening scripts, but I didn't want to just double down on the comment around this digital thing. I tried to call it out, but I'd say it's the most hopeful like for me that I've done. I've taken this question, 100 times of, hey, Ron, can you just spend more? Why don't you just invest more in sales and marketing, sell more and all that kind of stuff? And I've always said that, hey, we want good returns. We don't waste money. And practically, it's hard to hire 50% more people and you have turnover.  
 So at this time, Tien-Tsin, it's a bit different with the digital because you can kind of turn the crank, right, in a way and generating more visitors. On the call, I said we did that and generated 50% more visitors in Q2 than we had in the trailing baseline quarters. So that's the one place I'd say there's a ray of light there of us being able maybe to really step up the digital sales even more. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Okay. I'm glad you found that. 
Operator: Our next question is from Peter Christiansen with Citigroup. 
Peter Christiansen: Nice trends guys, really nice. Earlier in the year, I think there was this assumption that there's expectations that you'd make up roughly 2/3 of hard-hit accounts by year-end. Clearly, you're running ahead of that schedule. I was just wondering if you could update us on your thinking there.  
 And then just piggybacking on the last response, how are you thinking about incremental outperformance so far, reinvesting versus dropping that to the bottom line? How are you thinking about the decisioning there? 
Charles Freund: Peter, this is Charles. So on the softness recovery, I'd say the impact has basically tracked to our plan, but it's come in a little bit differently in that T&E spend came roaring back faster as the domestic airline travel and lodging that's associated with it. A few of the other areas were a little bit slower. So some of the industries that we called out in terms of cruise operators or hotels and lodging and such still haven't quite recovered where we thought they would, so mixed bag. The good news is it is tracking the plan. We do believe there's still further upside moving forward into the second half. So still optimistic that we'll get to where we more or less planned, but it may just come in a little bit different. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Pete, it's Ron. Let me just jump on the back of Chuck's comment, your part B. Yes is the answer, maybe not obvious from our Q2 results, but we actually spent some incremental money late in the quarter both in kind of incremental digital investments that I spoke of, along with IT. So I think the answer is to the extent that we're tracking ahead of what we're committing to here, I think you would see us spend more money. We've got some places where we think we can get returns now. 
Operator: Our next question is from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. 
James Faucette: I'm not sure what happened there technically but -- and I apologize if I -- you already answered this question in my absence. But I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the corporate payments growth. It seemed like that was a source of better performance at least versus our model and especially accounts payable. What are the kind of key drivers of strength this quarter?  
 And as a quick follow-up, I'll just get it in now. How correlated is that segment right now with respect to fuel in particular and kind of the broader business more generally? 
Charles Freund: Yes. James, this is Charles. The corporate payments business, as you said, kind of outpaced a number of the other businesses in terms of organic growth. And it was really driven by 2 areas. Our full AP was up over 50% as was the T&E. The T&E piece helped a lot through macro recovery or environmental recovery, I should say. In terms of the full AP being up over 50%, that's driven by strong sales. And so as we came through the pandemic, we actually continue to sell a lot of that product as people were looking for digital automated solutions where you can have as many people touching invoices. And you didn't need as many people to run processes. And during a lockdown, it's super helpful to outsource that process to us. So we had a lot of demand through COVID and that's continued into this year. So sales continue to be strong there, and you're seeing the flow-through on the revenue. 
James Faucette: Got it, got it. And just as a clarification then. And so that flow-through and benefit that you're seeing, is that driven by generally like just movement and acceleration of the business? And how much of that is tied or is being benefited by fuel prices and a little bit higher levels there? 
Charles Freund: Yes. We don't have a lot of fuel buying in the full AP area. So you have a little bit of it in T&E. And our T&E, our multi-card business fuel is about 7%, 8%, maybe the spend. But in terms of overall kind of what we call corporate payments, it's not a big factor. 
James Faucette: Okay. Great to hear that. 
Ronald F. Clarke: James, it's probably our technical thing to cut you off. But just to add to Chuck saying, again, the retention in that business is our world. It's super duper high. And obviously, we had incremental payments with clients we have. So that obviously drives the growth. That continues to inch up. 
Operator: Our next question is from Trevor Williams with Jefferies. 
Trevor Williams: Just so on the guide for the second half, if we back out the 2Q beat, the midpoint of the revenue guide at least for the second half is a raise of about $80 million from where you were. Could you just break out kind of how much of that is the contribution from AFEX? Fuel is a little bit higher than what was in the prior guide, maybe a little bit better FX versus just building in more organic revenue dollars in the second half. 
Charles Freund: Yes. So the $80 million lift, AFEX runs about $10 million roughly per quarter -- sorry, per month. So that will be a sizable contributor there. We are getting a little bit of macro love with fuel prices and we'll be coming -- FX seems to be kind of okay. So I'd say that between AFEX of, call it, 60 and then some of the macro and then we've got -- the rest would be organic lift versus where we thought. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Trevor, it's Ron. The macro is kind of going in a couple of different ways, right? There's happies like fuel prices that you called out. And then there's sads like, for us, like COVID in Brazil. Obviously, this came in worse than -- is worse than we thought. So there's kind of puts and takes in that. But to me, again, the thing I tried to say it earlier, I don't know people heard me, is it's not just so much the incremental guide, hey, we're guiding to whatever, 80 more at the midpoint. It's sequentially, even previously, we continue to believe there's an acceleration in the business. Again, that if you look at second half versus first half or even Q3 versus Q2, we're talking about revenue stepping up another, call it, $50 million. So I just don't want people to miss that, that we -- it's a business we can plan. And so we forecasted that roll rate, if you will, in the subsequent quarters. 
Trevor Williams: Okay. No, that's helpful. And I mean it's all moving in the right direction. And then just my follow-up on corporate pay. I mean there was good acceleration on the year-over-year growth rate but really no change from the first quarter, just normalizing for the easier comp. And I'm guessing just based on the numbers Charles ran through, I mean it sounds like virtual card is where there's still probably the most softness relative to '19 levels at least? I mean how much of that is the timing lag with invoicing from when you guys actually get paid there versus the potential for there being something that could be more permanent with the underlying customers. And then just as a clarification there. I mean, how much recapture from those soft virtual card customers do you have embedded in the second half guide? 
Charles Freund: Yes. So Trevor, you're spot on in terms of where the softness lies, mostly in that virtual card area where we would handle payments for cruise line operators, ticket operators, hotels, restaurants, et cetera. Commercial construction continues to lag a bit as well. There is still some softness that we're seeing -- lingering softness in the cross-border business, too, which I'd called out there, particularly Australia. That market is struggling and actually come back in a lockdown now. So I'd say you're spot on. We don't view this as structural, meaning that we believe it can come back or at least most of it will come back. It's just more of a timing issue. So the potential is there. It just hasn't recovered yet. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Trevor, it's Ron again. Let me just jump on to Chuck's thing that the thing that's fascinating is it's super concentrated. I don't have the exhibit in front of me, but circa 75 clients account for 1/2 to 2/3 of the softness in that particular line. And the good news is they're still alive because they haven't showed up in our losses. So it's not an across-the-board thing. It's literally the small handful of super impacted clients that are still kind of down but not out. And so to Chuck's point, to the extent that they come back, we haven't planned a bunch in the second half for them. But to the extent that they stay open and come back, that could be happy for us next year. 
Trevor Williams: Okay. Got it. And so there's not much from them that's embedded in the second half number? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Not much. 
Operator: Our next question is from Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research. 
Kenneth Suchoski: I just want to ask about Beyond Tolls. I just wanted to get your appetite. I just wanted to ask about your appetite there to kind of open up the credit lines. And I think you mentioned that you expect Beyond Tolls to contribute to revenue growth and volume growth. So I mean what's the expectation there in terms of contribution to revenue growth in the segment or to a total company, whether that's back half of this year or next year? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Ken, it's Ron. It's a good question. So the first thing I'd say is it's been different than we planned because Brazil slid into a COVID problem kind of in the February, March period. I believe it's starting to come out. If you look at the curve, it's starting to kind of reopen. So that's the first comment is the activity and people driving obviously is less than we planned. 
 But what I'd say for this particular thing is it's less credit because we do put some of the stuff on credit cards, and we do have experience with customers that we take money from their bank accounts. So we're -- we've got the credit under control. It's a network issue for us. So we spent a lot of time optimizing the digits on the software that go in parking garages and fuel sites and fast food to get the right performance, to get super high performance and stuff. And so we put a ton of capital. I think, Chuck, it's in the $10 million to $20 million range again to build out. 
 So they're adding network like crazy now, which we see already even through this COVID lens volume going up because we've got obviously millions of consumers already that have the tag that just need a gas station or parking garage near them. 
 And so I'd say that it's the combo of those 2 things: one, the rate at which we build out the network; and then two, the rate of recovery of people driving around again. So I don't know when those -- that thing will cross the curve, whether it's later this year or the beginning of next. But I'd say we're still -- based on the investment I just mentioned, we're super bullish on the idea. 
Kenneth Suchoski: Yes. That makes a lot of sense. I guess my follow-up question. Just maybe we could touch on the Roger acquisition. I mean how is that cross-sell progressing? Are customers receptive to adopting that solution? Any comments there would be really helpful. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Another good question, Ken. So I'd say still early days. I guess we've owned it for, I think, 6 months now. We've got a few thousand. Last time I looked, having 3,000 kind of active clients, SMB clients on the platform. So it's working, it's out there. We're starting to market. Obviously, we had to do a lot of work to get the digital selling machine and the tech built in and get it combined into other FLEETCOR assets and stuff. 
 And literally this month, in August, we kind of launched the cross-sell. I think I mentioned it in the top of my comments that we're taking the fuel card UI that, what was it, call it 100,000 clients use to go in and pay their bills and basically putting in the Roger payment platform to pay the FLEETCOR bill and offer to pay additional bills. So that thing is actually going live in this month. 
 So we'll report back. But I'd say, again, we're -- the category is super high. We've got a super good product. We're selling a few thousands, and we're making sure the quality is good. And were on the 1-yard line here to launch the cross-sell. So early, but I'd say encouraging so far. 
Operator: Our next question is from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. 
Ramsey El-Assal: I wanted to ask you about EV. And what are you seeing in the marketplace today? Are you sort of planning for the future when it comes to thinking through this stuff? Or are you seeing fleets that are today moving in that direction? In other words, is it sort of a demand side kind of pulling you in order to make these changes? Or you just sort of trying to see what's around the curve and prepare for it? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Ramsey, it's Ron. That's another really super good question. I'd say it's a mix. So the EV action, if you will, is super pocketed. So we really only see stuff in Europe. So when we convene and we talk about EV and who's doing what, I'd say it's all quiet on the Western front here in old U.S.A. But we see it in certain markets. It's pretty active, for example, in the Netherlands. It's starting to become active in the U.K. and it's -- interestingly, it's starting with the big accounts. 
 And so what we are seeing is the corporate accounts, which I guess are trying to be green or whatever have more money and are willing to kind of dispose of the old-fashioned combustion assets are kind of the early adopters of the thing. So we are seeing some exchange, some transition among our client base at that level, at the corporate level. 
 And then Part B is what you said. We're trying to get the model clear, okay? What spend -- I don't know if had a chance to flip through the supplement we put out. But to me, it's just almost shocking that to drive a van into a EV station in the U.K. or to drive an EV van into a public charge point, it's the same cost to the guy. The guy spends -- or the gal spends the same amount of money for those -- to fill up or the recharge. Like I don't know if that would be what people would think. 
 But when you look at it based on the efficiency of the vehicles and the markup that the charge point guys are charging right there, you're like, oh, I didn't know that someone like FLEETCOR can actually get paid because there's real spend. And then this idea that we have live now of actually putting software at the employees' home to -- so he's not burdened with his own electricity costs and putting boxes and that stuff in, we're getting a bunch of money for that and a lot of demand for it. So it's a little of both. It's starting to head this way and then us trying to get out ahead of it so we can articulate what the model looks like. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. That's super helpful. Just a really quick follow-up. I just wanted to make sure that I got your kind of preliminary 2022 EPS view. It's effectively all in, about $14.70 to $14.90 is what you're seeing in terms of the base run rate in addition to the interest rate hedges rolling off, M&A contribution at this point. It looks like about $14.70 to $14.90. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. So let me be clear with you. We're not trying to give guidance, so let me go on the record. It's really just trying to say Chuck and I provide guidance here in the back half of $7, so just helping everybody with the math. So in a recurring business, that's an exit rate of $14, that's just what we provided. 
 And then I just did want to comment on a couple of super happy things. We work on deals and these are kind of FLEETCOR wheelhouse deals. And so they're rich with synergies. So our confidence -- my confidence is super high in that kind of $0.50 to $0.70 increment because obviously, they're late coming into our company and the synergies are well as the year goes on. 
 And the other thing is something the treasurer took me through a couple of weeks ago that we made a bad hedge or a roll off and so I'm happy. So I just want to make sure people are clear that there's some happy set of things in our business, including the exit rate of the business and these couple of things that we can see. But obviously, we're going to work hard to keep selling way more and buying way more. So I wouldn't, in one second, try to suggest that what I'm saying is anywhere near what the guidance is going to be. We'll cook that as we run through the year. 
Operator: Our next question is from David Koning with Baird. 
David Koning: I guess my first question is just in the fuel segment, thinking about Q3, normally, when we look back, it's kind of flat to up a little bit sequentially. I think this quarter, you talked about fuel will be a little bit of a sequential tailwind, which is nice. It's -- but it seems like there's going to be more -- it's going to be a nice sequential growth, just the way you're kind of guiding the year. What's all getting better like sequentially from Q2 to Q3? Like what's going to kind of drive that higher than normal? 
Charles Freund: Yes. So Dave, this is Charles. So one thing is we are seeing some higher fuel prices. So that's certainly helpful. As Ron mentioned, also great digital sales. So sales are -- and in that business, sales are recognized and turned into revenue pretty quickly, pretty quick translation. So that's helpful. Last year, as you know, sales were pretty awful. So that created a slightly different trajectory. So we're back on kind of where we want to be. So I'd say those couple of things combined with a little bit of COVID recovery still to go, but those things combined will help lift us a bit faster in Q3 versus Q2. 
Ronald F. Clarke: David, it's Ron. Just the one add to Chuck's thing there is the retention. I think someone -- Sanjay asked me at the opening of the call, I should have called it, hey, what's surprised us so far? Fuel card retention. I called out at the top of the call, we hit an all-time high. I don't know if we break it out, Jim, or not, but we're showing up at 94% for the company. But inside of that, we hit 92% from the fuel card business. So when you roll that through our sequential model, that creates lift in the second half as well. So we're at all-time retention. We've had crazy good sales, to Chuck's point, and we're getting a little bit of macro happy from fuel and COVID recoveries. So you put it all together, things climb pretty good. 
David Koning: Yes. And then I guess just as a quick follow-up.  The credit provisions have been really low. We can see that in the cash flow statement, and you mentioned it earlier in the call, too. Does your guidance for the rest of the year assume that, that stays low? And should we think of that changing much in '22? Should we like normalize it? Or what should we think about there? 
Charles Freund: Yes, David, it's Charles. So we are forecasting for credit to kind of normalize as we exit the year. So Q3 get up a little bit, Q4 get back to kind of what we would see more historically. As we're selling a lot more now, generally, credit follows the sales. I sell somewhat, and I try to underwrite really well. However, some people do get through and they go bad, then they get weeded out and the base then performs better. So as we have way more new sales now, we would expect that it's normalized. And so what I'd say is going into next year, I'd look for more kind of what we've done historically as a baseline. 
Operator: Our next question is from David Togut with Evercore ISI. 
David Togut: The transformation of the fuel card UI into a broader bill payment platform seems intriguing and reminiscent of what you did on the fuel card side when you open that up to more of a Beyond Fuel card. So can you talk about what you need to do to build this broader bill payment platform mostly on the merchant acceptance side because that would seem to be probably the heaviest lifting with this type of a payments project. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. David, yes, it's -- no, we think it's a pretty big idea. As I said, we're going live this month. And I think the trend is coming to us, right, that more and more of our both U.S. and European fuel card clients are using UI, using their phone and using the desktop and particularly going there to pay us, right, their invoices, right, whether they get an e-mail reminder. And so we have all these clients showing up pretty frequently inside our software UI. 
 And so what we've done, what we've been working on is taking the Roger bill pay software and basically making it the bill payment system of record. So when you go into the UI and look over to pay something, that platform is working. So we don't really have to rebuild the bill pay platform in the network because we got that already. And obviously, we have all those capabilities from our other businesses, merchant networks and the deals we have with our friends at MasterCard. We have all that other stuff, vendors that do paper making and everything. 
 So really, it's just customers. It's just seeing if the accounts are comfortable using the UI to do more than just pay us. And we'll have certainly a report for you back, but the numbers are just staggeringly big, right? It's over 100,000 just here in the United States are paying a bill every month on these UIs. So we're hopeful, I don't know if you want to call it the super app, but the idea is more and more people are using these software apps with us. We just want them to be more useful and we've got another product that's ready to go. So it's going live. 
David Togut: Got it. And just as a follow-up, what does the unit pricing look like on this bill payment platform when you go beyond kind of fuel card bill pay? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. So it's kind of almost free at this point to the client. We're looking at whether we should get subscription money for the software, if you will. But really, as you know, we get paid on the back end, mostly the stuff that we run through our cards and then obviously cross-border, call it, 8% to 10% of the stuff that could be cross-border. So we'll probably make it super attractive to our client base initially, get paid on the back side and then look to feather in some software SaaS fees as we go. 
Operator: Our next question is from John Coffey with Susquehanna Financial Group. 
John Coffey: My question is on the corporate payments segment. And I was actually looking at a company that's not traditionally a competitor of yours, Coupa. And one thing that they've been saying, they as a software company focus on procurement, they've been getting more involved in Coupa Pay. And I think what they would say is procurement and payments or payments of the procured items are actually complementary services. And if I'm paraphrasing their position right, they say, why would you go -- if you're doing procurement with us, why would you go outside and do payment when these things -- 2 things could be bundled? 
 And I was wondering what you thought of that sentiment. I was wondering if you disagree with it, why? And if you agree with it, is there any thought you would have that you would get maybe more exposed to the software side of the universe, particularly the procurement side of the universe? 
Ronald F. Clarke: John, it's Ron. That's also a good question. So first, just FYI for you, the company we bought 2 years ago called Nvoicepay in Portland was the pay provider to Coupa Pay. So we're pretty clear on what Coupa Pay is trying to do. I don't think you could ask them that they've done a lot today of combining the pay with the software, but I know that that's their ambition. 
 So what I'd say is for a year or 2, we've studied and looked at a bunch of companies that have software that's kind of up the value chain, right, AP automation, scheduling approval, workflow software and even on top of that kind of procurement contract compliance kind of software that you've mentioned. Our take on it is it will be all of the above, which means some clients will just take that AP automation software like they do from Coupa and not to pay. Some people will just take pay like what we offer, and some people will take both. And I think I've repeated that we probably will offer that. We probably will offer the both. I don't know if we'll offer the stand-alone AP automation software or not, but that's our take that based on the size of the company and the industry that they're in and the research that we've done is it won't be one size fits all. It's not like everybody is going to do it one way. 
 So we think it's a good idea. It's something that we'll look probably to offer. We do partner with people where we offer the pay into their software. So we're studying how well they're doing it. I call it, peanut butter and jelly. Is it going to be peanut butter and jelly? Or is it going to be not peanut butter and jelly? So I think the jury is still out on it. 
Operator: And our final question is from George Mihalos with Cowen and Company. 
Georgios Mihalos: I guess I'll ask 2 quick ones upfront. I guess on the sales momentum, the 106% of '19 levels. Just curious, Ron and Charles, where -- from a segment perspective, that seems to be outperforming where you feel you're doing better than expected and maybe sort of the pockets of any weakness, if there are any, from the new sales side. And then separately, Ron, just curious at a high level out of Washington, any thoughts about the infrastructure bill and what that might mean for FLEET? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. George, it's Ron. On the first part, the sales thing. So yes, I think I mentioned we've been surprised to the upside against the plan that we built. And I'd say this -- I'm sure it will sound funny to everybody, but it's been fuel. We've actually sold more year-to-date in the forecast. So the second half is actually higher in fuel than the plan that we built. So most of the overperformance against our internal expectations is fuel, and most of that overperformance is digital selling. We keep growing the share of new digital accounts that we're onboarding. And as I mentioned, we're investing more at the top to try to drive that. So that's the overperformance. 
 I'd say everything else is kind of mostly on plan. We're super pleased with it. As you mentioned, the plan is up, way, way up from last year and even up against '19. So I'd say everybody else is kind of delivering what we hope for. 
 On Part B, who knows on the infrastructure bill. I'd say, first, tell me what infrastructure is. And if it's like what it would be, what you think it would be, which is kind of fixing stuff and construction-centric, it could help us a lot. I'd say it looks a lot to us like the stimulus from last year obviously helped us get paid and helped a lot of our clients stay open and pay payroll. And so I'd say the same thing that if that comes to pass and gets funded and its regular old fashion kind of infrastructure where stuff gets built, we're pretty weighted concentrated in that construction segment. So it's got to help us. If there's more money and more work for those sets of companies, that will flow through to us. I'm not counting on it, George, by the way. It's a political thing. But if it comes to be and it comes to be the old-fashioned infrastructure, it's happy for FLEET. 
Charles Freund: And George, I would just add as Ron talked about the concentration in the construction vertical, that's not just in fleets that also pertains to our lodging business and our AP, full AP and virtual card businesses. 
Ronald F. Clarke: George, anything else? 
Georgios Mihalos: No, I think we're set. That's great color. Really appreciate it. Hopefully, that's a point of upside. 
Operator: And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. This is -- this concludes the conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you, everybody, for your participation.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-05-05 17:30:00) =====
Operator: Greetings. Welcome to FLEETCOR Technologies First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Jim Eglseder. Thank you. You may begin. 
James Eglseder: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our first quarter 2021 earnings call. With me today are Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO; and Charles Freund, our CFO. Following their prepared comments, the operator will announce that the queue will open for the Q&A session. It is only then that you can get in the line for questions. Please note that our earnings release and supplement can be found under the Investor Relations section of our website at fleetcor.com.  
 Now throughout this call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than non-GAAP information at other companies. Reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today's press release and on our website, as previously described.  
 I do need to remind everybody that part of our discussion today may include forward-looking statements. These statements reflect the best information we have as of today. All statements about our recovery, outlook, new products and acquisitions and expectations regarding business development and future acquisitions are based on that information. They are not guarantees of future performance and you should not put undue reliance upon them. We do not undertake any obligation to update any of these statements. 
 These expected results are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K and on our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available on our website and at sec.gov. 
 Before we begin, I would like to make you aware that over the last few weeks, we posted 2 short videos to the Investor Relations website. The first is around our approach and strategy for electric vehicles as discussed by Alan King, who is the head of the U.K., Europe and ANZ for Fuel and heading up that effort for us. The second is a video providing some insight into our downmarket full AP product so you can get a feel for what it is and how it works. We had mentioned that we would likely spend some more time on these topics in the future, and this is an interim step while we continue to work on those efforts.  
 So now with that out of the way, I will turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay. Jim, thanks. Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining our first quarter 2021 earnings call. So upfront here, 3 subjects: first, my view of Q1 results; second, I'll share our rest of year outlook; and then third, talk a bit about how we're positioned for growth over the midterm.  
 Okay, let me turn to Q1 results. So we reported Q1 revenue of $609 million, really kind of spot on our expectations. Reported cash EPS of $2.82. That's a bit better than our guide, mostly helped by lower credit losses and fewer outstanding shares. The macro, not much of a factor. We really called the macro pretty well versus our guidance. We did have higher fuel prices but a bit lower spreads and so really no impact there.  
 Against the prior year, we reported a revenue decline of 8% and an organic revenue decline of 6%. Unfavorable Brazil FX hurting our prints and continued weak same-store client volume softness impacting our organic growth.  
 All right, let me make a turn to the trends in the quarter and share with you what we're seeing. So volume, sequential volume in Q1 versus Q4, pretty stable, as we expected, but we are now beginning to see a bit of an uptick here in April, so early signs of volume recovery. Same-store sales or what we call client softness really stuck at approximately minus 6%. This continues to reflect a small segment of our client base that is struggling to recover but fortunately still trying.  
 Retention, really terrific in Q1. We reported 93% overall retention. That's our best result in years. Credit losses, very low for the quarter, $2 million. That was helped by a $6 million recovery and again, lower sales rolling into this year. But the real story of Q1 is sales, so Q1 sales results, nothing -- really nothing short of fantastic. Consolidated sales finished 7% ahead of last year. Yes, 7% ahead of last year, so finally growing again.  
 If you rewind sales over the last 4 quarters, so sales versus prior year, 55%, 81%, 92% and now 107%. Inside of that, our fuel card businesses, both here and international, coming in ahead of the prior year, driven mostly by record digital sales. So for Q1, we signed 35,000 new business clients worldwide, 35,000. So again, a terrific result. So the summary for Q1, I'd call it an in-line result for volume, revenue and cash EPS, and I call it an outstanding result for credit performance, retention performance and most importantly, sales performance.  
 Okay. Let me transition to our rest of year 2021 outlook, along with the assumptions behind that. Included in our Q1 earnings supplement on Page 12, you'll see our updated guidance for the year. So full year '21 revenue expectations at the midpoint, $2,650,000,000. That's unchanged from last time. Reasons that we're staying put are: one, Q1 revenue, again, coming in kind of on plan; two, we've built in significant sequential revenue step-up in the forward quarters, probably in the range of $100 million up from Q1 to Q4. So our Q2, Q3, Q4 revenue guidance now assumes revenue growth in the high teens.  
 In terms of the COVID recovery in our outlook, I'd say it's a bit mixed. U.S. and U.K. look maybe better than our planned outline. But in our case, the Brazil COVID situation, worse, and so a pushback there in terms of recovery.  
 On the cash EPS front, we will flow through our $0.12 Q1 beat. We'll raise full year '21 cash EPS guidance at the midpoint to $12.42, so $12.42 for the base business. In terms of the AFEX acquisition, hopeful now to close that deal on June 1. Initially, we thought May 1. So as a result of the 1-month delay, we're going to take the expected in-year AFEX accretion at the midpoint to $0.18 versus $0.20 previously.  
 If you combine the base business and AFEX, our consolidated EPS outlook at the midpoint would be $12.60, $12.60 for the full year. I do want to add, we feel very good about the AFEX cross-border deal. They had a great Q1 performance and their management is really holding steady their rest of year forecast. 
 All right. Let me make a turn over to our last subject today, which is how is FLEETCOR positioned for growth in '22 and beyond. So I do want to highlight just a few factors that give us confidence in sustainable growth. So one is the exit rate. So if we hit this rest of year guidance, our Q4 step-off will be quite strong heading into '22. And if we hit our rest of year sales plan, again, that will pour in-year revenues into 2022. 
 Digital, I can't say enough about digital and the investments we're making in digital selling, digital UIs and customer experience, new ways of underwriting credit, and so the digital transformation making a big impact on the company. Third is EV. We're actually embracing EV, particularly in Europe. Early feedback really, really positive there that we may actually be advantaged in selling because of our integrated mixed fleet experience as well as this at-home recharging opportunity. It looks real. It looks like clients will pay subscriptions to basically measure and reimburse employee recharging at home. So potentially a new meaningful revenue opportunity that is nonexistent today.  
 Fourth factor, our Beyond strategy or our entry into new segments. So as we've discussed before, we're extending into new customer segments really in each of our major lines of business. So in corporate pay, the Roger deal helped us enter the SMB space. In lodging, a couple of deals last year helped us enter the airline accommodation space. And in Brazil, we've entered what we call the urban driver space. So in each of these cases, basically, we're extending our businesses, extending our TAM and obviously extending our longer-term sales opportunity.  
 Fifth factor is brand. We've just introduced our new Corpay brand aimed at unifying all of our various corporate payment assets. So this single brand will help our corporate payment business go to market with a single identity and hopefully give us an advantage with this broader bundle that we've got.  
 And then last factor is capital. Our balance sheet's in terrific shape. Leverage ratio 2.5x, liquidity approaching $2 billion. Again, our plan is to generate $1 billion-plus of annual free cash flow. We have the ability to lever up to 3x target, which would produce circa $8 billion in capital to invest in either M&A or buybacks over the forecast period. So obviously, upside for us via capital allocation.  
 So look, the takeaways from today: so one, Q1, I'd say again, an in-line Q1 financial performance but an outstanding Q1 sales performance. Rest of year, again, we're raising rest of year cash EPS at the midpoint to $12.42. That's excluding acquisitions, and the $12.60 at the midpoint, that's including AFEX, so tracking to deliver that, although again, fully aware of the uncertainties.  
 And then lastly, in terms of positioning, we really do feel well positioned to grow the company next year and beyond. Again, we expect a strong exit, which will pour into '22. We're extending each of our businesses into bigger TAMs, and we've got the available capital to drive incremental returns if we manage it well. 
 So with that, let me turn the call back over to Chuck to provide some additional details on the quarter. 
Charles Freund: Thanks, Ron. For Q1 of 2021, we reported revenue of $609 million, down 8%; GAAP net income up 25% to $184 million, and GAAP net income per diluted share up 29% to $2.15. Included in our Q1 2020 results was the impact of the $90 million onetime loss related to a customer receivable in our cross-border payments business, which equated to $0.74 per diluted share, as reported last year.  
 Adjusted net income for the quarter decreased 8% to $242 million, and adjusted net income per diluted share decreased 6% to $2.82 as we continue to feel the effects of COVID on our businesses. Organic revenue growth improved 2 points sequentially to down 6% on a year-over-year basis. We saw improvement in every category except tolls as Brazil continues to grapple with incremental COVID-related shutdowns.  
 As a reminder, organic revenue neutralizes the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and fuel spreads and includes pro forma results for acquisitions closed during the 2 years being compared. Our fuel category was down organically about 6% year-over-year, which was a 4-point improvement from Q4. The international fuel business growth was a bit better than North American growth as those international markets shut down earlier in the quarter last year, so had easier comps. 
 The corporate payments category was down 5% in the first quarter, 1 point better than Q4, as improvements in virtual card and full AP were offset by FX, which was lapping a very strong Q1 last year. Full AP growth accelerated 14 points sequentially to 21% growth year-over-year, powered by continued strong new sales.  
 Tolls was up 3% compared with last year but down 4 points from Q4 of 2020 due to the aforementioned shutdowns in Brazil. Looking longer term, compared with Q1 of 2019, revenue was up 13% organically. The lodging category was down 14%, which was an improvement from down 25% last quarter, with domestic airline activity recovering faster than we expected. Gift showed organic growth of 2% year-over-year as that business felt the effects of COVID earlier in Q1 of 2020 than most of our other businesses. 
 That said, we've seen real traction in digital card sales and in our B2B sales efforts where we are selling gift cards to businesses for use as incentives. Recognizing that the comps to 2020 may not be very helpful, we did add some comparisons to 2019 for organic revenue growth and sales, so you can see how we are trending compared with the most recent pre-COVID or "normal year." That's available in the supplement we provided today.
 Looking further down the income statement. Total operating expenses were down 7% to $343 million, excluding the impact of the onetime loss in our cross-border payments business last year. The decrease was primarily due to better bad debt expense, lower expenses in Brazil due to the currency translation impact and lower T&E costs as travel and the associated expenses are much lower than last year. As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses excluding the onetime loss were stable compared with Q1 of 2020 at approximately 56%.  
 In the quarter, bad debt was only $2.5 million or 1 basis point, as it included the benefit of a $6 million recovery for credit loss recorded in the first quarter of last year. Credit continues to be a bright spot, but we expect our bad debt to normalize as our new sales levels recover and grow. Interest expense decreased 20% to $29 million due to lower borrowings on our revolver and decreases in LIBOR related to the unhedged portion of our debt.  
 Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 21.8%. Excluding the impact of the onetime loss in our cross-border payments business last year, our effective tax rate in Q1 of 2020 was 18.9%. The increase over last year's adjusted tax rate was due primarily to the level of excess tax benefit on employee stock option exercises relative to pretax income. 
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $958 million of unrestricted cash, and we also had approximately $1 billion of undrawn availability on our revolver. In total, we had $3.5 billion outstanding on our credit facilities and $915 million borrowed on our securitization facility. As of March 31, our leverage ratio was 2.48x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement.  
 We refinanced our securitization facility at the end of the first quarter, less than 6 months after our last refi. Recall that our normal 3-year term expired last fall when credit markets were unfavorable, so we entered into a 1-year note at LIBOR plus 125 basis points with a 37.5 basis point floor, expecting to refinance again when conditions improved. Our new securitization has a duration of 3 years at LIBOR plus 100 basis points with a floor of 0, so our effective all-in rate is approximately 50 basis points better, given the current level of LIBOR.  
 We've also just completed a refinance of our Term B credit facility, upsizing it to $1.15 billion for a new term of 7 years and maintaining the rate of LIBOR plus 175 basis points. We used the proceeds to pay off our existing Term B note, pay down the revolver, fund the AFEX acquisition and improve our liquidity position for future capital actions. 
 We repurchased approximately 640,000 shares during the quarter for $170 million at an average price of $266 per share, and we have approximately $836 million in repurchase capacity remaining under our current authorization.  
 Now let me share some thoughts on our outlook. We are maintaining our full year revenue guidance of between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion as improvements in some businesses such as domestic airline lodging are being offset by other places like Brazil and Europe that are experiencing incremental virus flare-ups and associated lockdowns. 
 As we explained last quarter, our full year guidance assumes we recover about 1/3 of our Q4 exit revenue softness during calendar 2021, and that this recovery would account for about 4 to 5 percentage points of revenue growth in the second half.  
 Within that expectation, there is very little recovery impact assumed for Q1, a modest amount for Q2 and then an acceleration into the back half of the year. While we are seeing some puts and takes between businesses, our overall outlook remains intact. You can see our full updated guidance and assumptions in both our press release and our earnings supplement, so I won't reiterate them here.  
 We are raising the midpoint of our adjusted net income per diluted share guidance $0.12 to $12.42 to reflect our first quarter results compared to our expectations. Looking ahead, we are expecting Q2 2021 adjusted net income per diluted share to be in the range of $2.80 to $3 per share. Volumes should build throughout the year with the COVID recovery and our new growth initiatives gaining momentum.  
 As for AFEX, the closing is taking longer than we had hoped, but we still believe the deal will close by the end of the second quarter as we're nearing the finish line with all of the approvals we need from the various regulators globally. Because of the delay, the in-year benefit will be slightly less than what we expected in February. But the upside is that we've had more time to refine our integration plans, so we'll hit the ground running at full speed once we do close. 
 With that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. 
Ramsey El-Assal: I was wondering if you could provide us with a little more detail on the Corpay initiative. Is this more of kind of a branding exercise? Or is there sort of tech integration and kind of organizational changes and sort of unifying the sales strategy underneath it all? Maybe if you could also just comment on Roger and your go-to -- the progress with your go-to-market efforts with that product, that would be great. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Ramsey, it's Ron. It's mostly trying to unify the middle market corporate pay assets, but we're also going to rebrand the Roger SMB Corpay. So basically from small to middle market, we'll have 1 brand. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. All right. I also wanted to ask about the pace of the recovery at the enterprise versus SMB level. I know that's something that you've called out in the past. Are you starting to see a more even recovery evolve across the business or is it really still the large customers that are driving some of the recovery? 
Ronald F. Clarke: That's a great question. The answer is it is becoming more even. We're seeing more recovery now among the SMB group, which is obviously helpful. So our revenues are improving a bit faster than our volume recovery. So it's good news. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Starting to smooth out. All right. 
Operator: Our next question is from Pete Christiansen from Citigroup. 
Peter Christiansen: Nice push on the sales. I was wondering if you could provide us a bit of a breakdown on new sales in the corporate payments segment. What's the ear to the ground on there right now, I guess, ahead of launching this go-to-market with Corpay? And then my follow-up is along the lines of Ramsey's question is, how should we think about the main go-to-market push here with Corpay? Is this aligned with the whole UCX execution strategy in the back end? Just a sense of timing there would be helpful. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. In terms of the first part of the question, the sales, the answer is yes, kind of all the segments. I think I called out the fuel card businesses were ahead of the prior year, so was the corporate payments business. So really strength virtually everywhere, except, I'd say, Brazil. Brazil was a bit softer than we had outlooked mostly because of the COVID situation. So with that exception, really, the sales were super terrific. 
 Yes. On the Corpay question, again, the answer is yes. I mean, again, as I mentioned earlier, it's unifying all of the products, which helps in a lot of ways, to your point. It helps not only with the UI in terms of being able to cross-sell and showcase but it also helps at the top of the funnel, being able to promote a broader line of things to prospective clients that are earlier in the cycle because who knows, per se, which product may be interesting at that moment? So we think there'll be benefits both engaging prospects at the top of the funnel, and then once we've got a client on one of the products, it would facilitate our ability to cross-sell it. 
 So -- and then again, the comment I mentioned earlier that we're going to use the same brand kind of down market in SMB land is in the middle market. So it will look, we hope, as we put this thing out, pretty seamless to whoever is looking in. 
Operator: Our next question is from Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research. 
Kenneth Suchoski: I just wanted to ask about the corporate payments segment as well. I guess, can you just talk about your ability to go direct to corporate payment customers in the SMB channel? Because we've heard that churn rates are higher there, so the unit economics might not make sense unless you kind of have that strong brand and history operating in that segment. So I'm just curious if you could talk about the opportunity there. Or is this really a cross-sell play into the existing base? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Ken, it's Ron again. It's a good question. I'd say that it is both. We're super excited about being able to take a bill pay product back to the hundreds of thousands of clients, both here and in Europe, and we've actually come up with some creative ways, we think, to get that product in front of our existing accounts. So that's one. 
 But then the second one, to your point is, yes, we'll go out directly to SMB prospects. And clearly, digital has now become, I don't think 60% of our fuel card sales. We're getting lots of new smaller accounts via that channel. And we have a lot of other assets in corporate pay to be able to monetize it, for example, in the back end with our merchant network in terms of putting some of the payments through virtual cards. So we think that we can go out with pretty attractive proposals, if you will, out to the prospective accounts and still make a bunch of money, if you will, on the back end. So we'll go out both ways, both to existing clients and to prospective ones. 
Kenneth Suchoski: Okay, that's really helpful. And I guess maybe just as a quick follow-up. I think you mentioned that there was some lower T&E expense in the quarter. I mean, what's the expectation to put some of those expenses back into the P&L now that sales are bouncing back? 
Charles Freund: Yes, Ken, this is Charles. What I'd say is that as always, we balance our investment with expenses with revenue. So as we continue to perform and grow, we'll be adding some of that expense back. We'll be reopening travel fairly soon here, so that will start to flow through, all of it, mostly to support sales and growth. And then as the volume does recover, there will be some throughput of that on the expense side and processing. 
Operator: Our next question is from John Coffey with Susquehanna Financial Group. 
John Coffey: My -- I guess, this the fourth or fifth question on corporate payments but it's a short one. When I see your revenues in the quarter, it looks like you actually had sequential growth in corporate payments. And I was wondering, I think in the call last quarter, you mentioned there was a lot of political-driven spend in Q4, which probably would have seemed like a bit of a onetime thing that would have really elevated Q4's revenues a bit, and I guess I thought maybe you would have seen a little bit of a decline there going into Q1. Is there any like 1 factor you would say that really drove this sequential growth in corporate payments? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. John, it's Ron. That's a super good question. Yes is the short answer. Everything you said was right. We did have a nice spike in Q4 from the political. It's really this full AP. If you recall, we bought a company just about 2 years ago called Nvoicepay that does AP automation, kind of full AP outsourcing, if you will, payments. And so that business, it's just going gangbusters is the short answer. 
 We've, I think going back to the baseline of 2019, more than doubled the spend and revenue in that business. And I think we've got a plan to sell this year in '21 like 60% or 70% of the base of that business. So that business was picking over $50 million. We've got a plan to sell $35 million or $40 million. So we've got more of our sales energy and people basically against that particular product line. So that's what's creating the delta. 
John Coffey: Okay. Great. And by the way, as far as corporate payments go, with that being said about Nvoicepay, is there a good way to think of the cadence of revenues throughout the year? 
Charles Freund: Specifically for corporate pay? 
John Coffey: Yes. 
Charles Freund: Yes. So if we're looking at that business, we should also add to Ron's comments that the sales there are also quite good. The sales were up 18% year-over-year. If we look at then the sequential growth in full AP -- just 1 second. Yes. I mean, normally, I wouldn't give out too specific but I'd say it's going up circa 15% sequentially each quarter. 
Operator: Our next question is from David Koning with Baird. 
David Koning: I guess, my first question, just on the fuel segment itself, historically, I think sequentially, it would often be up about 5% or so. I guess I'm wondering, are we back to kind of normal seasonality? I know on a year-over-year basis, I guess, the one thing to think about spreads benefited $26 million, I think, last Q2. So just putting those 2 things in perspective, I guess, sequentially, maybe up 5% normally again and then the spread impact, are we thinking of that right? 
Ronald F. Clarke: David, I'm not -- It's Ron. I'm not sure I got the question. Are you asking, "Hey, as we exit this COVID time frame, do we think that the fuel card business is a 5% kind of normalized grower if you kick out spreads and COVID?" Is that the question? 
David Koning: Yes. I'm actually just asking more just sequentially. I think in Q2, you used to grow, give or take, 5% sequentially, just kind of typical seasonal patterns. And are we back to kind of a little more normal seasonal pattern now sequentially in Q2? And then separately, just thinking about the spread impact. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. On the first part, I would say, even through COVID, we saw very similar seasonal patterns, to your point. Historically, there's more work days in Q2 and Q3, and obviously, the busier time certainly here in the U.S. and stuff vis-à-vis holiday. So yes, the answer to seasonality is it's kind of same old, same old. And yes, it would be in our guidance and stuff reflected the way that you just said. In terms of spreads, Chuck, do you want to take that one? 
Charles Freund: Yes, I'd say our view of spreads going into Q2 sequentially is relatively flat, maybe slightly improved as fuel prices are leveling out. To your point, year-over-year, they're going to be way down. Q2 of 2020 had kind of record spreads. 
 In terms of the seasonality and sequential revenue within fuel, what I'd say is I'd remind you that we do have some COVID recovery planned in our forecast. So assuming that, that comes back, we should get a little bit higher than normal in terms of sequential growth in that business. But again, a lot of that recovery is still back-half focused but we have some plan for Q2. And we're seeing early, early signs in April. But as Ron mentioned, it's still early. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Dave, just to jump 1 last thing on what Chuck said. Your comment is right. Obviously, if you looked at the fuel prices in Q1, they were generally upticking kind of throughout the quarter, which obviously pressures spreads a bit. So as we were exiting the quarter and obviously, we've seen April, what you said is true. We'll have a bit better overall quarter if fuel prices stabilize because spreads have kind of normalized, to Chuck's point. So you're right that this quarter would be better than the full Q1. But if fuel prices stay the same, then we'd expect spreads to kind of stay normalized the balance of the year. 
David Koning: Got you. And just 1 quick follow-up. The provisions you called out, I saw in the cash flow statement the $2 million of credit provisions. Should we get back to the more $15 million to $20 million per quarter type range in the future or might it stay pretty low for a while? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Let me start and then Chuck can pick up. I'd say that probably short term, kind of this quarter, maybe in the next, it will probably continue to run a bit lower. And that's a function of a couple of things. One, the credit policies we had in place a lot in 2020, right, to be protective of the assets of the company. And then two, unfortunately, the amount of new sales we had in 2020 were lower than normal and lower than planned and they carry higher losses. 
 So when you have a mix of less new to existing, you'll have lower credit losses. So those couple of things will make it a bit better. But I think as you roll forward, I think we would probably anticipate we get back more, David, to normalized levels because we've opened the credit patches, if you will, now, and again, our sales are way up as we said. So maybe a little bit kind of short term and then normalizing as you head to the back of the year. 
Operator: Our next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Ron, I want to ask about acquisitions and your appetite there. And any update? We've seen some of your peers pick up, I guess, in M&A activity and definitely there's some capital raising going on as well on the private side. So where's your head at there? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Tien-Tsin, good to hear your voice. Better, I'd say, probably like the peers that you call out. We were telling someone earlier today, we've actually gone back to real in-person meetings. I actually did a real-life M&A call a couple of weeks ago. We met the principals in real life, so that's kind of nice to actually see people. So yes, I mean, obviously, one of the reasons that we did the refi and upsized the thing is we do have a pipeline of deals. Like I mentioned, we're looking to close upon this AFEX thing here in a few weeks. And we have a couple of other things close in that we like. And so that was the basis for kind of lifting that liquidity. 
 So it feels better to me. I mean, I don't say it's back to normal, but we've got things in the categories we like. We've got some accretive deals, which we tend to really like. So yes, we're in a -- I feel like we're back in really a better place, feeling comfortable, if you will, with some of the transactions in front of us. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Okay. Good. No, that's encouraging to hear. And I think on the -- just as a quick follow-up. I think you guys mentioned same-store was sort of still hovering in that down 6% level. I'm curious, because I get this question, on the client side, like how much of that is cyclical versus maybe structural? I know your client base is somewhat diversified, but any observations there on when they'll get back up to speed on the recovery? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. It's a super good question. So 2 comments, Tien-Tsin, back on that. The first one, which I think I mentioned in my opening comment, is we have the luxury of seeing April volume. So I'd say the first thing is we're actually seeing the thaw, if you will, in some of that same-store stuff, so some recovery literally already in some of the lines in April. 
 And so our expectation -- my expectation is Q2 here is going to be the thawing that will move off of that 6% kind of flat line and see less of that, right, in this quarter. And then the second one, to your point, is we studied it to death here and it's just a super narrow set of clients again. So when we go in and look at the, call it, that 6% overall or consolidated softness and you run the distribution, you've got 1 decile that accounts for 100% of it. 
 It's just there's a narrow set of clients that are in super impacted -- movie theater companies, cruise line companies, you name it, we've got clients that are in super hurt businesses. And so we're seeing, again, some that aren't that impacted already coming back in April. And my -- our sense, which is kind of built a bit into our guidance, is that some of those that are still significantly down will start to rebound here in the second half. 
Operator: Our next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: I know, Ron, you mentioned the U.S., U.K. are ahead of expectation, Brazil behind. But as the reopening's happening, anything that you're seeing that sort of stands out to you, especially relative to pre-pandemic trends as they come back? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Nothing other than it's just incredibly pocketed, I guess, is what I'd say. I did call out the U.K., but as you know, we do have broader businesses in more countries over there. We're on the continent in 4 or 5 countries. We're in Russia. We're in Australia, New Zealand. And so to me, the fascinating thing is just how different the recovery and the softness is across those 5, 6, 7 countries would be the first call out. Like Russia is kind of -- I don't know if they had COVID, is booming again. And Australia and New Zealand are celebrating. They'd rid the thing. We see huge rebounds there. The U.K., the thawing is happening here in the second quarter. The Czech is going backwards. So the first comment is it's just incredibly kind of pocketed by place. 
 And then the second one is really the comment I made to Tien-Tsin, which is it's incredibly, in our case, narrowly focused on a very, very small set of clients that again are causing the overall number, right, the consolidated number to be negative. And so those are the 2 things we see. And I did mention, and I think we're super surprised by the Brazil thing. Probably like others, we didn't anticipate that coming into the year that, that thing would get worse and that they would raise the restrictions and stuff. So that one, I'd say, is the one thing that's really mostly the surprise to us. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Okay. And then maybe just to follow up on Tien-Tsin's question and your answers on the M&A. You also talked about the significant amount of liquidity or dry powder you have. I guess, how much of that dry powder do you think these deals that you're contemplating would eat up? And how long do you envision sort of having this much dry powder around? I mean, what -- would you consider stepping up the buyback if you felt like the inorganic opportunities weren't there? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean, this particular situation, we have some transactions. Obviously, we announced publicly the AFEX thing at what, $450 million, Chuck, $450 million. And as I mentioned, we do have a few, call it, 3 deals that are quite late. And so the combination of those 2 things is what caused us to basically upsize the facility now. So that's kind of the short-term thing that we try to obviously prepare our liquidity situation for the pipeline that we see. 
 But I think longer term, we really don't think about it that way. Deals are bumpy. Sometimes you spend a lot of money in a year. Sometimes we don't spend a lot, and we'd have enormous opportunities for liquidity based on where our leverage ratio is and the cash that we generate. So we really, I think, try to think about it short term, when we see a situation where we've got some stuff lined up. And then longer term, we really just focus it, honestly, on the M&A side. 
 We look for super attractive things we have conviction in and then back our way into how to pay for it versus the other way around. But on your other comment, if we don't like our stock price, which obviously, there's been times we don't, we'll obviously increase liquidity and buy back shares. So again, I think the headline to you guys is we start by looking out at attractiveness of deals and how we feel about the price of our stock and then work our way back into what liquidity we need. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: And I guess just 1 -- I'm sorry, 1 quick follow-up. Just the types of deals that you're looking at, are they pretty much bolt-on or are they getting into different verticals? 
Ronald F. Clarke: We're actually looking at both. We've got a couple of deals, to use your word, bolt-ons. We call them in-category, so they're transactions that fit inside the 4 or 5 categories that we articulate to you guys that we like because they're super accretive. And we've got 1 thing in particular we're looking at that's kind of an adjacent, kind of not right in the middle of those 4 or 5 and kind of midsized $0.5 billion kind of sized deal. So it's a very interesting set of things sitting in front of us. 
Operator: Our next question is from Georgios Mihalos with Cowen and Company. 
Philip Caldwell: This is Philip on for George. So I think you talked at the beginning of the call about your investment in the U.K. EV company, Mina. And you talked about the new subscription at-home option. I was just wondering, is that giving you more confidence that the economics around EV in the future will be more comparable to the current fuel card business? Or what is giving you confidence around your ability to compete in EV vehicles in the future? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, it does, Philip. It's a good question. So the headline answer is it does. And it does because we have actual real clients. And to your point, we actually have a real software solution that we're implementing. And so if you run a company in the U.K. and have gone to some mixed fleet, you've added 20 EV vehicles and you want us to help measure and reimburse that. And we talked to you about how we're going to get paid for it. The fact that real clients are paying meaningful amounts of subscription does help equalize, to your point, the economics of this thing as this thing converts. 
 In addition, obviously, I try to say it a bit on the call is during this transition time, I really love our chances because it creates an advantage, right, as the company adds 10 new EV things, it's hard for anyone who doesn't already have the incumbency position and data on all the vehicles to go sell a guy some kind of phone, mobile solution or something to deal with the 10. Like why would they ever want that when we've made our card and mobile programs work at all the public EV recharging places as well as at home? 
 And so in a kind of a really interesting twist here, the old-fashioned fuel car guy actually has the advantage because you can't blink and change out the installed base of all the vehicles in a day without obviously flushing a lot of value. So I'd say, as this thing has manifested itself, we're feeling better and better about the economic model of the future. 
Philip Caldwell: Okay. Great. That's great color. And then just on a follow-up. With an infrastructure build being bandied around at the federal level in Washington, do you have any initial thoughts on how that might help your customers? I know you have a pretty decent exposure to construction customers. Is that something that you're thinking about impacting '21, '22 growth or not contemplated yet? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean, who knows, to your point, where that bill goes? But the answer is yes to your question. I mean, we saw it in spades in this last bailout, the ability of a lot of our clients to be able to pay their invoices, and we got scared and credit and found out it was one of our best collection years ever. So obviously, stimulus money does find its way back. And to your point, a large part of our business, both here and in Europe, call it, circa 30% is in various forms of construction. 
 So to the extent that the stimulus actually goes to that versus, I guess, some of the other things that are in the bill, it has to help us, to your point. It has to make the existing clients we have busier and obviously results in more revenue to us. So yes, it would be happy going into next year, for sure. 
Operator: Our next question is from Trevor Williams with Jefferies. 
Trevor Williams: On new sales, so it's good to see the step-up in the first quarter getting back above 2019. So if you just thinking if you continue to see that ramp throughout the year and especially in fuel, I mean, how quickly could you see some of those sales start to layer onto revenue? Just thinking about whether there could be some benefit even to numbers this year. And if there could be, if there's any impact embedded in the guide, or if we should be thinking more about the bulk of new sales as being a 2022 leading indicator. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I'd say, Trevor, it's Ron, that it's mostly the second thing. So we've got a lot of experience in the company by category of the translation of what we call new bookings or sales will start to roll call, right, the recognition of a new account. And when it converts, to your point, into in-year revenue, and that conversion rate varies a tremendous amount by the products we have. 
 So for example, in fuel cards, it's probably 50%. If you sold $100 million, you'd get $50 million in-year. Or Brazil, if you sold $100 million, you might get $60 million or $70 million. But if you sold corporate pay in the middle market, you might get $20 million. So the conversion rates vary tremendously by the product category. But what I would say is, clearly, we're good at math, and so we built our '21 plan and guidance anticipating good sales. 
 These sales were above what we did plan. But generally, that's all cooked into the plan and the guidance that we have. And so the biggest help is what I said, if we make this plan, which would be up over 30%, right? As you go into the next quarter, it's like we'll probably double Q2 sales because it was pretty low, but hopefully, be up over 30% for the full year. You've got lots of those categories like corporate pay where that revenue pours into '22. So people should listen carefully to the sales numbers, which I did try to call out. They really are an early leading indicator really of '22 revenue. 
Trevor Williams: Okay. No, that's really helpful. And then, Ron, you mentioned you're seeing some uptick in April, it sounds like. I mean, any way you guys could give us a sense of how things are trending quarter-to-date in April or even exited Q1 relative to 2019? The slide in the deck is really helpful, but just I'm curious if at any of the segments, if any of them either exited Q1 or quarter-to-date in April are trending higher relative to '19 than they did for Q1? Just to see where we might get some kind of meaningful sequential acceleration in Q2. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. That's another really good question. So again, it's super early. The data is kind of hot off the press. But what I mentioned is, selectively, we see areas where sequentially, the volumes are starting to come back to par, if you will. And even against the base period of 2019, we're seeing growth. 
 So just to call out one, like in our international fuel card business, for example, which we kind of break into 4 markets, the U.K., Russia, Central Europe and Australia, 3 of those, the volumes in April are higher than they were in April of '19. And the 1 that's not is Central Europe, where again, the COVID restrictions are still in place. So we're seeing same in corporate pay. We see areas like the virtual card business that's way ahead of its baseline from April. The full AP, I think, I mentioned is more than double. The cross-border business is up. So a lot of the businesses are now, in April, ahead of their '19 baseline. 
 There's a handful of stubborn ones that I mentioned that are more COVID-impacted like again, Central Europe, like the T&E card, which requires people like us to travel. Like the airline lodging business that we bought, it's coming back, but it's still soft against the prior period. So there's a handful 3 or 4 areas that are pretty stubborn and then 8, 10 areas that we're seeing the thing come back. So as I said, our view is we're going to see a change in same-store this quarter, Q2. And then we plan a pretty significant recovery again in Q3 and Q4, which will pour revenue and, more importantly, profit dollars into the second half. 
Operator: Our next question is from Bob Napoli with William Blair. 
Robert Napoli: Ron, a question on the corporate payments business in the long term. And your thoughts on balancing growth with margins, and you have a number of high-growth public and private companies that are investing very aggressively and looking at margins down the road where you're generating strong margins today. Do you have thoughts of aggressive -- and given the TAM and investing more aggressively at the expense of margins to accelerate growth, is that something that you've considered or would consider? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Bob, it's Ron. It's a terrific question. We actually had our Board meeting last week and actually covered this particular subject, competing in this strange time that we're in. And I think the couple of comments I'd give you is, one, we tried to build plans to invest more -- differentially more in that business than some of our others to try to target that business closer to 20% on the top versus kind of 10%, if you will, for the consolidated company. So that's point one, that inherent in our base plans, our overall profit plan, there's incremental investment to grow faster already. 
 And then second, I think the conclusion that we got to coming out of the Board meeting on this is it depends on the investment. So if there's a clear investment we can make that's got an attractive return profile, we'll be back to you and the buy side with, "Hey, look, we're going to slow earnings a bit, whatever, if we think we can make some great return." But again, it's got to be a return we can execute. So hey, if it's hire 100 people, I've told you a bunch of times, that's hard to add all those people execution-wise and make it work, versus if we could pour money into the top of the funnel of the digital thing, which is one of the lot -- reasons we did this Corpay unification, that might be a basis, right, where we could spend money effectively and see good returns. 
 So I'd say nothing staring us in the face now. We've got lots of money, incremental capital. I think we're spending $20 million, $25 million of incremental capital above last year in IT. Half of that's in corporate pay. We're spending more in sales. And so if we got the right kind of investment, I think the answer is we would do it. 
Robert Napoli: That's helpful. And then a question on the lodging business, and I don't think we really touched too much on that. I was wondering just your thoughts on -- that business, I know, has been a very attractive return business. You've been investing in it over the years. What are you seeing in that business sequentially like through the first quarter into April? And then your thoughts on the opportunities to invest in that business over the longer term because I do think you drive some of your higher margins there. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. It's a super business, to your point, because again, we're pretty specialized, right? We're in the workforce segment, think blue collar people that drive off and cut trees and then in the airline accommodation where we're connected literally into the airline's systems. So we know that the 2 or plus pilots are going to show up somewhere tomorrow. 
 So the answer is, obviously, it's recovering. It was one of those businesses hurt really the most a year ago. So we've gotten a lot of it back already in the workforce side. And I'd say we're probably half of the way back. In fact, it's the 1 area that outperformed the COVID recovery in the first quarter. For each line of business, we plan a certain amount of softness, if you will, coming back, and the airline business actually came back faster than we planned. 
 So I think it's on track, depending on what happens over the next couple of months, to have a huge recovery, right, in the second half. And we're selling a lot. Like I'm looking at the sales, we continue to sell a lot in that business. We've got some attractive adjacencies in the business. It's probably our highest margin business. So to your point, there's a lot to like about it, and people should keep their eyes open. We're probably going to do more of it. 
Operator: And our final question is from David Togut with Evercore ISI. 
David Togut: On a normalized basis, post-COVID, do you expect to resume FLEET's historic growth model of high single to low double-digit organic revenue growth plus a couple of points of acquisition growth and/or share repurchase, driving 15% to 20% EPS growth? And if so, when do you expect to reestablish that growth model? 
Ronald F. Clarke: David, it's Ron. It's a great question. I think if I've been repetitive on something it's been 10-13-19, 10-13-19, which is if we can grow revenues organically 10%, we can grow operating EBITDA, if you will, faster because of the operating leverage and then use the $1 billion of capital to either buy earnings or buy shares. So we've proven, I guess, Chuck, over 20 years, we've compounded, David, at over 20%. 
 So the reminder to you and others out there is, I think for full year calendar '18 and full year calendar '19, the business grew 10% organically in those 2 most recent years until we hit COVID here in 2020. And so my expectation is that we will be back there in -- certainly in '22. And part of it is, again, the setup is just so good in terms of the exit rate that if we get this recovery in the second half and we make the sales that we're making, the exit rate pouring into '22 will obviously be super attractive. 
 And then to your point, the deal we've announced and a couple we're working on will be, as I've mentioned before, quite accretive. And so it all points, I tried to say it in the thing, I think the business, because of the pain we took last year, is particularly well set up to get a good number in '22. And then what I'd say to you is we like our chances after that because we're diversifying the space, right, in the businesses, the fuel card thing chasing EV and launching, chasing new categories and getting into SMB and corporate payments. We're not sitting still just kind of twiddling the places that we're in, David. 
 And so I think it's -- I think we sit here more optimistic about the future because we're coming out. We're freaking coming out, finally coming out of the woods here and can kind of see the other side, and that sets up well for us. So I'd say, '22 will be better and then we like our chances after that. 
Operator: We have reached the end of today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-04 17:30:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the FLEETCOR Technologies Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. 
 I would like to turn the call over to our host, Mr. Jim Eglseder, Head of Investor Relations for FLEETCOR Technologies. Thank you. You may begin. 
James Eglseder: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings call. With me today are Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO; and Charles Freund, our CFO. Following the prepared comments, the operator will announce that the queue will open for the Q&A session. It is only then that you can get in line for questions. 
 Please note, our earnings release and supplement can be found under the Investor Relations section of our website at fleetcor.com. 
 Now throughout this call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than non-GAAP information at other companies. Reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appear in today's press release and on our website, as previously described. 
 Now before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everybody that part of our discussion today may include forward-looking statements. These statements reflect the best information we have as of today. All statements about our recovery, outlook, new products and acquisitions and expectations regarding business development and future acquisitions are based on that information. They are not guarantees of future performance, and you should not put undue reliance upon them. 
 These expected results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K and in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC and available at sec.gov. 
 With that out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q4 earnings call. Upfront here, I'll plan to cover 4 subjects: First, I'll provide my take on our Q4 finish; second, I'll put a bow on full year 2020; third, I'll share our 2021 outlook; and lastly, provide a bit of an update on our transformation plan, which is intended to accelerate the company's growth. 
 Okay. Let me turn to our Q4 results. So today, we reported revenue of $617 million, that's down 12%, and cash EPS of $3.01, that's down 5% versus last year. These results, both better than anticipated. Volume recovered a bit more in the quarter than we forecasted, and we did manage our operating expenses down 14% against the prior year. Organic revenue growth overall, minus 8%. But most importantly are the trends in Q4, really quite good sales strengthened to over 90% of last year's level. Same-store sales or client volume softness improved to minus 6%. Credit loss of $6 million, although helped by a reserve release, and retention continued steady at 92%. 
 We did have a fantastic beyond highlight in Brazil in the quarter. We added 175,000 new urban or city users in Q4. That represents 30% of all the new tags we sold in the quarter. So it demonstrates there's real demand among the non-toll segment in Brazil for this RFID purchasing network, including fueling, parking and now even fast-food locations. 
 So look, the conclusion of Q4 is really in the sequential trends of the business. If you look at Page 7 of our earnings supplement, you can see that every Q4 metric is improving from the Q2 low: Revenue up from $525 million to $617 million; cash EPS up $2.28 to $3.01; sales up from 55% to now over 90% of last year's level; same-store sales volume getting better from minus 17% to minus 6%; credit losses from $21 million to $6 million; and then lastly, retention holding steady at 92%. So to us, evidence that the business continues to recover from the earlier year lows. 
 Okay. Over to 2020. So from a financial perspective, 2020, not our best year. Revenue finished at approximately $2.4 billion, that's down 10% versus '19, and cash EPS finishing at $11.09, down 6% against 2019. 
 COVID and the shutdowns did manage to vanquish over $400 million of revenue that we planned in 2020 really in 3 ways. So first, client softness, we had a number of COVID-impacted clients that used less of our services. COVID reset the macro environment in Q2, driving down fuel prices and weakening international currencies. And then third, for a while, COVID reduced our 2020 new sales mostly due to the market being distracted. 
 The good news is despite the fact that COVID is going on, that we're still living with COVID, is the financial impacts on us appear to be lessening. So we've now recovered in Q4 about half of the client softness, revenue loss that we experienced in Q2, so half of it back already. Post the macro reset, we've seen relative stability in fuel prices and FX rates. And lastly, the demand for our services, clearly recovering as sales reach 90% of prior year levels. 
 So despite not having the greatest financial performance in 2020, we did manage to accomplish a few things. So credit, I'm just delighted with our credit performance in 2020. Expenses, tough times, but we did manage expenses down over 10% in Q2, 3 and 4. We signed 4 acquisitions in 2020. Our guys ran IT exceptionally well, had the best overall system uptime in the history of the company. 
 And lastly, we were able to replan the business in the second half. We conducted a replanning exercise in the summer, and the actuals came in a smidge better than the replan. So reminds us again that fleet's a business you can plan. I really do want to give a shout-out to all FLEETCOR people who hung in there and kept the company going through very unsettling times. 
 Okay. Let me make the turn to 2021 and outline our initial guidance for the year, along with the assumptions behind it. Clearly, a higher beta in our 2021 numbers. But we'd say that our setup is generally positive. So first, volume and revenue trends strengthening through 2020, so the potential to continue that into '21. Sales production improving, thus the amount we expect to get of the in-year revenue from new business. And as I mentioned a bit ago, very solid client retention and credit trends. 
 We're also hopeful that we'll get additional client softness recovery in '21, although we're the first to admit that, that's hard to forecast. So in our guidance, we're planning to recover about 1/3 of our Q4 exit revenue softness that's still outstanding now. So if we get that, that recovery would provide about 4% to 5% of incremental revenue lift in the second half. 
 So with that, our guidance for '21 would be as follows. Revenue of $2.650 billion at the midpoint, that reflects an 11% increase. Overall organic revenue in the same range, kind of 9% to 13%. But I do want to emphasize that, that assumes 3% to 4% of softness recovery from today's level. We're anticipating significant sales growth, over 30% this year, which would be a record level of sales for the company. And profit guide at the midpoint, $12.40 of cash EPS for the core business. We are planning about $0.10 of dilution from the Roger acquisition. So that would put our consolidated number at $12.30 at the midpoint. Lastly, assuming now a May 1 close for the AFEX acquisition, accretion could be approximately $0.20 for the year. So if that happens on time, that could take consolidated cash EPS to $12.50. Chuck will speak further about how the guidance rolls out across the quarters. But I do want to point out that our guidance outlooks Q2, 3 and 4, revenue and profit growth to be back into the high teens. 
 Okay. Let me transition now to my last subjects, which is the company's transformation plan. So really, our transformation plan is intended to accelerate growth by doing 2 things. So first, the portfolio, deciding what businesses we want to be in and not be in and constantly reworking that to have a more diverse set of faster-growing businesses. But the second way we transform the company is through our Beyond strategy, which we do utilize in all 4 of our major existing businesses. So in this Beyond strategy, we're really trying to do 2 things. First, identify new segments of the market that we can extend the business into. So we ask who else can we serve. 
 And then second, we identify additional or adjacent services that we can cross-sell back to the client base. So if you look at Page 11 of our earnings supplement, you'll see the current Beyond initiatives for each of our 4 businesses. 
 We do continue to make progress against our Beyond strategy. Just an example to call out, in our lodging business in 2020, we now settled 25% of all proprietary hotel payments with our virtual card in which we earn interchange. So that's up from -- literally from 0 a few years ago. But today, we begin implementation of maybe our most exciting Beyond initiative of all with the acquisition of Roger. So this begins the move of our corporate payments business down market into the SMB space, along with the opportunity to offer full online bill pay to our global SMB fuel car base. You can see that on Pages 11 and 12 of our supplement. 
 So this single bill pay initiative has the potential to dramatically accelerate growth rates in both our corporate pay and fuel card businesses. We feel like it's a pretty unique position that we're in because of the special set of assets that we have. So a large global SMB client base numbering in the hundreds of thousands. We've got working SMB sales channels that historically have acquired 30,000 new clients per quarter. We've got scaled virtual card processing capability. We generated over $30 billion in annualized spend last year. We've got a very large merchant database that allows us to monetize virtual card, and now we've got some modern cloud software to provide the bill pay functionality along with a pretty cool user interface. 
 So look, in conclusion today, I'm hoping to provide just a few takeaways. So Q4, again, not our best quarter from an absolute perspective, but clear evidence of improving trends in the business. 2020, we did manage to perform better as the year went on and certainly learned some new tricks around how to manage credit, expenses, IT, even sales in a remote environment. '21, again, our setup, we think, looks pretty good, only a slightly unfavorable macro to deal with, but improving trends coming into the year. And certainly, the wildcard that I mentioned of what happens with the incremental softness recovery. And lastly, transformation, our Beyond strategy now progressing -- providing some traction. But today's online SMB bill pay initiative may be the biggest of them all. 
 So with that, let me turn the call back over to Chuck to provide some additional details on the quarter and our outlook. Chuck? 
Charles Freund: Thanks, Ron. For the fourth quarter of 2020, we reported revenue of $617 million, down 12%, GAAP net income down 11% to $210 million and GAAP net income per diluted share down 6% to $2.44. The quarter was again affected by COVID-related business slowdowns, although we showed improvement over last quarter in most of our businesses. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 decreased 10% to $258 million, and adjusted net income per diluted share decreased 5% to $3.01. We continue to manage expenses in line with revenue performance. Please see Exhibit 1 of our press release for a reconciliation of all non-GAAP financial metrics. 
 Organic revenue in the quarter was down 8% overall, primarily due to same-store sales being down 6% year-over-year. Organic revenue neutralizes the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and fuel spreads and includes pro forma results for acquisitions closed mid-period. Our fuel category was down organically about 10% versus Q4 last year. Our domestic fuel businesses were stable to improving in the quarter, whereas the international fuel businesses were affected by the renewed COVID-related closures, especially in Western Europe. 
 The corporate payments category was down approximately 6% in the fourth quarter. Approximately 6 points of decline was again driven by the 100 most affected customers we discussed last quarter. Lower spending on our T&E product drove another 2 points of organic drag. 
 Virtual card volumes were up 12% for the quarter, which was an improvement from flat last quarter as continued political spend and the benefit of new customers offset the drag from the highly affected customers. Cross-border or FX-related volumes were down 1% as payment volumes are still being affected by lower invoice levels, specifically in manufacturing and wholesale trade. Full AP continued to perform very well with volume up 14%. New sales of full AP were very strong as full year 2020 sales were more than double 2019's results. We continue to invest here and have enabled 10 new ERP integrations in 2020 with plans for another 10 or so in 2021. 
 Tolls continued to be our most resilient business and grew organically 7% in the fourth quarter, up 4% from last quarter. Active toll tags were up 6% in the quarter, with urban tags accounting for 25% of all new tags sold during 2020. The lodging category was down 25% organically in the fourth quarter, with 20 points of drag caused by the inclusion of acquired airline lodging businesses in the year ago period. Our workforce lodging business has improved with volumes down in the mid-single digits. Airline lodging volumes have also improved in line with flight activity but still remain well below last year's levels. 
 Looking further down the income statement. Our total operating expenses were down 14% for the fourth quarter of 2020 to $323 million. We performed in line with the high end of our target reduction compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower volume-related costs, lower employee-related costs, including head count, sales commissions, bonuses and stock compensation. We also saw lower T&E expenses in addition to the impact of foreign exchange rates. As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses were approximately 52.4%, a roughly 240-basis-point improvement from last quarter. 
 Bad debt expense in the fourth quarter of 2020 was $6 million or 2 basis points, which includes a reserve release of $5 million. Bad debt was only 4 basis points, excluding the reserve release. Our bad debt levels continue to be good, and our aging roll rates remain very favorable. There is still uncertainty around the timing, level and duration of government stimulus and various responses to increasing COVID cases around the world. So that's still a consideration on our reserve. 
 Interest expense decreased 13% to $30.3 million, driven primarily by decreases in LIBOR related to the unhedged portion of our debt. This was partially offset by the impact of additional borrowing for share buybacks earlier in the year. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 20.3% with a reduction from last year driven primarily by incremental excess tax benefit on stock option exercises. 
 Now turning to the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2020, we have approximately $1.9 billion of total liquidity, consisting of available cash on the balance sheet and our undrawn revolver at quarter end. We ended the quarter just shy of $1.5 billion in total cash, of which approximately $542 million is restricted and consists primarily of customer deposits. We had $3.6 billion outstanding on our credit facilities and $700 million borrowed in our securitization facility. We remain committed to a consistent program of capital allocation, using our free cash flow for acquisitions and buybacks. 
 In the quarter, we repurchased roughly 181,000 shares in connection with employee sales. In total for 2020, we spent $850 million on share buybacks. We believe that we have ample liquidity to pursue any near-term M&A opportunities while still opportunistically buying back shares when it makes sense. For the quarter, we had approximately $23.4 million of capital expenditures, and we finished with a leverage ratio of 2.67x trailing 12-month EBITDA as of December 31. 
 Now let me share some thoughts on our outlook. Looking ahead, we're expecting Q1 2020 adjusted net income per share to be between $2.60 and $2.80, which, at the midpoint, is approximately $0.31 or 10% lower than what we reported in Q4 of 2020. About half of the difference is attributable to revenue seasonality. You see, while some of our businesses like gift have seasonally strong fourth quarters, most of our businesses have seasonally weak first quarters. Of course, volume-related expenses will slightly offset this revenue seasonality impact. 
 Roughly 1/3 of the difference is due to the normalization of certain expenses. For example, in Q4 of 2020, we released $5 million of our bad debt reserve, which we do not expect to repeat in Q1. As sales performance has continued to recover throughout 2020, we expect bad debt to gradually increase sequentially as those customers' balances age. Additionally, when the impact of the COVID-related shutdowns became clearer in 2020, we proactively reduced our annual incentive target payouts by 50% and accrued to those lower targets for the remainder of the year. As our business has recovered meaningfully, we plan to return incentive targets to 2021 to normal levels. We also expect our effective tax rate in Q1 of 2021 to be about 80 to 100 basis points higher than the rate we reported in Q4 of 2020. Lastly, the acquisition of Roger and incremental sales and marketing investments are slightly dilutive to the quarter sequentially. 
 Now looking beyond Q1 to full year 2021, we feel it's important to help you understand how we're thinking about the outlook and providing some ranges around possible outcomes, even though those ranges are a bit wider than what they had been in the past. For 2021, we're guiding revenues to be between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion and adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $11.90 and $12.70, inclusive of the Roger acquisition. We're still faced with substantial uncertainty regarding the pace of economic recovery and the impact it will have on our financial performance. That said, we've developed a 2021 budget which incorporates everything we know now, including revenue and expense run rates, current macro environmental factors, planned sales contributions and expected attrition impacts. In addition, our guidance assumes a continued rollout of the vaccines that will allow gradual volume and revenue improvement in the first half of the year with an acceleration in the back half of the year, as client softness and new sales performance improve sequentially. 
 As I mentioned earlier, we expect several expense lines to normalize higher in 2021 compared with 2020. As our business recovers, stock and bonus accruals as well as sales commission expenses will be higher. T&E will rise as our salespeople get back on the road, and volume-related expenses will also rise with increased business activity. Bad debt expense is expected to normalize as we've reopened credit and our sales performance continues to improve. We're also making incremental investments in sales, marketing and IT to support our growth aspirations and to deliver a 2021 sales production plan that's more than 30% higher than 2020's results. 
 We're extremely excited with the Roger acquisition, and a disproportionate share of our incremental sales and marketing investments will be directed towards that business. As such, the fully loaded acquisition will be an estimated $0.10 drag to adjusted net income per diluted share in 2021. As we've demonstrated time and again, we do take a balanced approach on expenses, and we'll adjust accordingly if we see revenues begin to deviate from our expectations. 
 And lastly, we continue to work through the approvals on AFEX, which have been slowed by Brexit and virus-related shutdowns. While we still expect the deal to be accretive in 2021, we now believe it is more likely to close in Q2 versus our original expectation of Q1. And just for clarity, AFEX is not included in the guidance ranges I provided earlier. 
 And now, operator, we'd like to open the line for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Thanks for all the color on the trends and the guidance. But just to drill down on the guidance a little bit. When I think about the ranges on the extreme ends, could you maybe, Charles, just talk about sort of what's baked into one end versus the other? 
Charles Freund: Yes. So appreciate you joining, and thanks for the question. So in terms of the high end, I'd say that, that would be a perfect scenario, right? So as Ron mentioned, we are assuming recovery in terms of the COVID softness that we've experienced. The timing and the magnitude of that is super hard to suggest. If it all came roaring back, if our sales were perfect, we maybe could get there. So it's a pretty broad range, as you can see. 
 On the downside, I mean, who knows what's going to happen with COVID, right? So if things weren't to come back, it could be a problem. We just think -- we think that we're being reasonably optimistic in that regard given everything that the news says: The economy, the vaccines, the Biden administration mentioning things will be back in by Q3. So we're optimistic in that regard, but I'd say that the range is broad because we just really don't know. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Sanjay, it's Ron. Let me just add on to Chuck's comment, which -- the second thing would be the sales. So we've got a pretty steep sales plan increase for '21. And so the amount of that, that we get in year in revenue, both the backlog and the pace at which that comes in, that will also have a pretty big swing on the range we gave. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Got it. And then Ron, you guys are obviously flushed with quite a bit of liquidity. I mean, as you sit here and you think about the next year, how do you envision utilizing it? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I think our philosophy, Sanjay, is kind of steady as she goes, right? Our first use is accretive acquisitions, and we're sitting here today with 3 or 4 interesting active deals in the pipeline. So that's always our first and highest use. And then to your point, given the leverage ratio and stuff, if our stock doesn't trade where we think it should, obviously, we've indicated we'll buy stock back. So acquisitions, one; and stock buybacks, depending on the price, two. 
Operator: Our next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: I want to say, I guess, the new sales were encouraging. Your reinstating guidance, that's also encouraging. Any way to think about the level of conservatism in the outlook? Kind of like what Sanjay was asking about the range, I think I understand it. But just I'm thinking there could be some pent-up demand on new sales. The trends are clearly improving. You're excited about this SMB bill pay, which makes some sense. So I'm just trying to understand conservatism versus maybe excitement about the chance to get back to double-digit plus growth here. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Tien-Tsin, it's Ron. I'd say that we try to build these plans to what we call the most likely, right, and then figure out how wide a range around it. And so I think the confidence part comes from looking at the trends Q2, 3 and 4. I don't know if you picked it up in my remarks, but we've literally gotten half of it back between Q2 and Q4, which is obviously quite significant. And it's still a pretty big number, right, when you look at the total softness we had for all of 2020. So I'd say that there's no precision in this. We -- I think we caveat-ed this as many ways as we could about the wildcard of softness recovery. So I'd say that we provide ranges to try to keep it in the midpoint. So we don't know, but I'd say kind of at the midpoint guide are the most likely. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Okay. And you talked about with Roger bill pay being potentially pretty big from an opportunity standpoint. So what's the timetable or the steps to get to a point where it becomes needle-moving? What steps need to take place? What should we be tracking? 
Charles Freund: Yes. I mean, it's a great question. I'd say we'll probably -- they're obviously in the market on a stand-alone basis and even here in the U.S. So the first 2 things that we're on is: one, cross-selling that product back to our North America base; and then I'd say in 90 days, we should be launched with our own channels, our own digital, our own deal and phone people selling it to new prospects. So by the time we talk next time, we'll hopefully have some news for you. 
Operator: Our next question is from Steven Wald with Morgan Stanley. 
Steven Wald: Maybe just following up on Tien-Tsin's question on Roger and thinking about the investment. I was just curious if you could speak to the timing for the investment. It sounds like it might be somewhat front-loaded. And how you're thinking about that dilution as it's planned over -- I guess, relative to 1Q guide versus the full year? And then what that envisions for 2022, if you're able to sort of frame out the potential contribution from Roger? 
Charles Freund: Yes. So some of it is just obviously deal-related, right? We picked up their people, 50. So we've got some dilution happening immediately. We are investing, even in advance now, at the corporate level to support that acquisition as well as building out those sales channels. So we'll see that ramp up. 
 In terms of the contribution for next year, I'd say we haven't fully modeled it yet. But it's roughly going to be still a little dilutive to kind of flat until we fully scale the channels. So we want to obviously see what works before we pour too much in. But nonetheless, I'd say that the things about -- it is a very small acquisition, $1 million-some-odd, a couple of million in terms of revenue. So it's got a long way to go, but we're pouring a lot of sales and marketing kind of upfront to get it going. 
 It's a real bet for us. It was a real deal. We're investing to retain the people that are there because they've helped to build this product, and we're going to need their help to continue. So we've built some extra cost in there as well. So in terms of the magnitude of what it could be next year, it's really going to depend on how much more we pour into the investments. 
Steven Wald: I appreciate that. And then maybe just switching gears towards some of the things you outlined on Slide 11 and 12 with the Beyond strategies. I know you talked through a few of the main -- the key areas that you're directing investment. But clearly, it seems like the corporate payments and then layering that into the fuel business are a couple of the main areas beyond the toll business that has its own growth plan. I'm curious how you're thinking about the lodging business and investment dollar priorities coming out of the pandemic. Clearly, there are going to be some permanent behavior shifts, and I guess that one strikes me as probably the most obvious area. But I'm curious if you could sort of stack rank for us how you're thinking about Beyond as it relates to investment priorities. You've got a lot of liquidity, as has been pointed out. But certainly, there's got to be some level of priority that you guys are thinking of. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Steven, it's Ron again. So yes, I think you called it out right. Clearly, corporate pay would be one, and fuel would be 2 because of the size of the business, but it's still 40%, 50% of the company. 
 In lodging, the one thing I would say is, remember, our FLEETCOR lodging business is workforce: Translation, blue-collar utility guys going to a new city, tree cutters cleaning up. And so that thing is way back. I mean, I looked at the January volume numbers earlier today, and I believe month-to-month, that thing is down 3% to 5% now year-over-year. And so that lodging business looks completely different than the kind of lodging business we people on this call are thinking about. 
 So the airline part of that is a completely different call. To your point, that thing is running kind of 50% of volumes of a year ago. But that's the one, I'd say, has the snap, bounce back possibility. So we've cut -- took a ton of money out of that business, particularly out of the airline portion of the business, to kind of wait here to see if it's going to snap back. But it would be number three, but we still like it. I think we lay out on that Page 11, there's a couple of interesting verticals beyond workforce and beyond airline that we're looking at that we like a lot, that leverage everything we have, the systems, the network and stuff. 
 So I want to be clear, we like that business, and we will keep investing. And we may buy some additional things in the business. Let me be clear: It's not white-collar T&E kind of a lodging business. 
Operator: Our next question is from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. 
Ramsey El-Assal: I wanted to ask about Brazil, and that was a pretty impressive statistic in terms of how many new users you're signing up. I wanted to ask about the merchant acceptance side of that equation. Do you kind of have what you need now to basically continue building out that product? Or is there a pipeline of new merchants or verticals in Brazil that you could see yourselves kind of getting involved with, along the lines of McDonald's or Petrobras or these other merchants you have great partnerships with? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Ramsey, that's a good question. I think we're mostly focused on the 3 or 4 city locations that we mentioned: fueling, parking, fast food and then condos, effectively access right for people back in the city. And so the plan, we put a fair amount of capital actually in the '21 plan to build out particularly the fueling footprint there because it's the biggest TAM, right? The dollars spent on fuel are massive. 
 And so the bit of the delay was not only COVID, but our guys tinkered and came up with 2 or 3 different hardware-software configurations for the fueling locations that improve reliability like super high. So the car gets in, the thing knows it's the right car and doesn't make mistakes and to dramatically reduce the cost. And so that business is going to be on a super-duper, hurry-up drill even now, even in the first half of the year, trying to add stations across the board. So we should see those transaction counts, usage of the thing, grow a lot as we move into the second half. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. And then on a separate topic, I wanted to ask generally about the kind of credit aperture across your business and whether it's sort of opened back up again. I mean, obviously, it has to some degree. But was there a revenue headwind in the quarter from sort of tighter credit standards, given we're still in a challenging kind of macro environment? And how should we think about that in terms of maybe potentially even opening further as we go forward? Or is that largely -- kind of narrative largely sort of played out? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Another good question. So I'll start the answer to that one of we overreacted, right? So when the thing happened, we kind of pulled pretty far back, which clearly reduced revenue. We even pulled back on existing accounts, right, trimming lines, accelerating payment terms and stuff. So we went at it pretty hard. And now we've reported out for the year. And I think Chuck even mentioned the forward roll rates, so we've got the, I think, the lowest credit loss, as low as I can remember, and certainly as the base is against spend. And so we rotated back. 
 I'd say in the fuel card business, we are 100% back. So whatever credit policies we had pre-COVID, I'd say, if you went and looked at our fuel card businesses, we are right back to fully open, still balanced, but fully open. 
 I'd say the one place where we're still being a little cautious is in the corporate pay. And the reason is the spend per client there is so significant, if you think about it. And so we're still being careful. There's certain industries sitting in the corporate pay space that have been pretty impacted. So I'd say we've moved that one back but still not all the way back because it's more high line, what we call internally, high-line risk of a couple of BKs for some significant amount of money. So I think there's still upside as we roll through '21, as those 3 or 4 industries were cautious on kind of come back. 
Operator: Our next question is from David Togut with Evercore ISI. 
David Togut: Just following up, Ron, on your comments on corporate pay. Can you give us some sense of the ranges you're thinking about for the T&E card for 2021? That seems to be the biggest swing factor within that business since most of the other categories are holding up reasonably well. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. David, good question. So the overall corporate pay business sitting inside the guidance we gave is high teens. So if you take the entire line of business sitting in our plans, we're out looking at high teens for that. I think inside of that, the T&E, which has now shrunk down, is probably in the mid- to high single digits. And if you remember, what we call kind of the multicard, kind of walk around plastics there that buy supplies, even fuel, and they're even used as P-Cards as a form of vendor payables, that line of business, that plastics or multicard, I think the last time I looked, is down to about 20% of it now being white-collar T&E, like us. 
 And so fortunately, kind of 80% of that business is kind of okay. It's buying fuels. It's buying supplies. It's paying vendors. And so it's not going to decline, if you will. It's not going to drag down really the growth rate as much because it shrunk down in 2020. So fortunately, it will have less impact on the total corporate pay business this year. 
David Togut: Got it. And then just a final question on the gift card business. Is the view that you're going to hang on to that for quite some time, just given the cash that you generate from it, even though it appears to be a declining business? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I'd say the short answer to that is yes. So obviously, retail as a category was super impacted in 2020, brought our gift card business pretty far down at the opening kind of in Q2. Surprisingly, the thing has come back quite well. People still, obviously, if you look for the word gift cards, are still ordering gift cards. And the digital portion of those, David, has gone way crazy high. And we bought a business a year ago to help our retailers manage online, pretty timely as they've rotated over to more online sales. So surprisingly, that business is getting healthier from some of those digital initiatives. 
 And so what I'd say is we'll kind of see how this year goes. Their plan is actually up, obviously, off of the softness for '21. So I think we're probably taking another peek at the business as we get late into this year. 
Operator: Our next question is from Pete Christiansen with Citigroup. 
Peter Christiansen: I'm just thinking through the incremental investment on some of the IT initiatives here. Can you give us some of the time tables for your key goals here? And have you considered whether or not, given that we are in a recovery year, that -- possibly accelerating some of those investments? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Pete, it's Ron. I'm not sure that we're accelerating through the recovery year. I think we're doing 2 things. One, we're trying to invest in projects that drive growth. So we've kept the capital plan kind of up a bit, $15 million, $20 million, Chuck, I think, over the prior year. 
 And then second, we made a decision, Pete, to pour more money into, what we call, IT transformation or modernization, whatever the word is. So we're pretty hard on the trail of consolidating some of the apps, updating obviously some of the hardware and software and stuff. And so we're pouring money into simplifying kind of our technology footprint, while we're obviously still making investments in digital and things like Roger, new analytics packages, new mobile interfaces. So we're spending money on things that we should be but also on the transformation side. 
Peter Christiansen: That's helpful. And then, Ron, a little bit of a longer-term question here. The drumbeat on EVs has kind of picked up recently with Ford and GM making some announcements and the Biden administration looking to switch over the federal fleet. I mean, does this change how you think about the fuel card business longer term and perhaps on how FLEETCOR intends to manage any broader changes industry-wise there? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean, I think, Pete, a bit, I think we've been on for all kinds of reasons, not only EV but just TAM and growth rate and long-term potential of the company of diversifying things that we do that share the same model. And so I don't know where we're at, 60% now, I guess. So we're moving anyway. But I said a little bit in the call the last time on the EV thing that our perspective on the thing is: a, it's way farther out, even if the acceleration of EV sales is pretty dramatic because of the size of the installed base and the useful life. Our models show the same number of commercial vehicles, the combustion engine vehicles in 10 years here in the U.S. and in the U.K., our 2 biggest markets in 10 years as today because of the growth rate of sales and again over the life. 
 But the more important point I mentioned last time is, it's less about the fuel card buying fuel or the fleet card buying electricity. I think what we're learning, particularly in Europe and in the U.K., is we're getting paid by our clients as they move to some EV. They're paying us card fees, for example, for the EV vehicle the same way. And there's this new opportunity of, we're going from, call it, 150,000 gas stations in the United States to having millions of charging points at employees' homes. And so the employers look like they want us to play a role in the hardware and software and the measuring of all of those new charge points and all the reimbursement. 
 And so it's early days. But I'd say to you guys that doing what we do of measuring and helping pay and reimburse employee expenditures in and around vehicles, we think we're still going to get paid a fair amount of money both in the transition to mixed fleet and even when people get over to EV. So we're going to have a little bit of a teach-in maybe in 90 days on this subject, with the takeaway hopefully being: a, it's way long or out there for the old combustion engine; and b, what FLEETCOR's economics may look like even in a pure EV world. 
Operator: Our next question is from Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. 
Ashish Sabadra: Congrats on a pretty good result, considering the difficult macro environment we are in. My question was on the sales front, pretty good acceleration there, going back to 92%. You called out full AP sales doubled. I was wondering if you can also talk about the sales growth in other segments. And also, as we think about next year on a 30% -- expectation for a 30% higher sales compared to this year, areas where we can see more strength. I guess SMB bill pay will definitely be one of the areas, but any incremental color will be helpful. 
Charles Freund: Ashish, this is Charles. So yes, in terms of the sales performance, as Ron had mentioned, we exited Q4 at over 90% of the prior year. It is mixed. So I'd say Brazil had an unbelievable sales year. Overall, in the fourth quarter, really outperformed versus prior year. So they were well up -- well above, call it, 15-or-so-percent above last year. There's still a couple of the businesses that are lagging a bit. And particularly, our North America fuel business is still catching up. It's on an upward swing, but it just hasn't recovered quite as quickly. Our lodging business has actually come in kind of right around last year. So that's performed okay. 
 So it's mixed, I'd say. But nonetheless, they've all kind of come back from Q2 through Q3 and exiting Q4 at a better place. And looking forward to next year, we've got pretty robust ambitions and plans. We're going to have the -- we have the biggest sales plan in the company's history, and we're planning to be up 30% versus where we finished this year. So we've got a lot to do. We're pretty excited about the possibility there. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Ashish, it's Ron. Just to jump on to what Chuck said. One of the things helping us is the market is kind of coming back, right? We study surges of the categories. And so some of the results we're reporting Q4 is the world just kind of getting used to this and kind of getting on with things. And so we think as that keeps moving our way, where businesses are interested in the kind of things we do, that, that helps. And then, b, of course, we're going to invest more, right? We're going to have more FTEs, more digital spend. We've got some new products that we've talked about. So we're super excited. I mean, first of all, we've got super soft comps in Q2 when sales almost closed down. 
 And so to Chuck's point, this is a super big deal for '22. I know most people on the call are interested in this year, in '21. But my headline to you guys is that if we make the sales plan, which is super big, both against the prior year and absolute, it's -- that will pour all kinds of revenue into '22, which is part of the softness that we're dealing with here in '21, right, that we basically took a 1.5 quarters out of selling. And so you don't get the same wave of revenue rolling into the forward year. So I just don't want people to miss the importance of the sales plan for next year. 
Charles Freund: I'd also just comment that when COVID hit and we took our foot off the accelerator in certain areas, right, because we weren't going to pour incremental sales investment when the market wasn't listening and they were distracted, so we slowed down some of those incremental investments. We're shifting gears now in preparation for a big year next year and the reopening of the economy, fingers crossed. And so we're investing ahead of that. And I think that's also putting a little pressure on our forward guidance in terms of earnings, right? Because we're making sales investments again in a big way. So I think we should be mindful of that. 
Ashish Sabadra: Yes. No, that's very helpful color. Sorry. Just maybe a follow-up question on the SMB bill pay opportunity. Obviously, that's a large opportunity. A lot of players are going after it. And congrats on the Roger AI acquisition. So I was just -- maybe a follow-up question to earlier questions there. You obviously have a very warm lead, which positions you much better. But can you just talk about how long are those sales cycles, implementation times? And how do you plan to leverage your existing sales force and the warm leads that you have to maybe accelerate and double down on that opportunity? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Ashish, another super good question. So one of the attractive things about the SMB bill pay is what you said, it's the instamatic sale and sign up and get going. The card business that we have today, which is in the middle market, has a pretty prolonged kind of implementation cycle. It's almost like a project to get a $200 million company to connect with you and get the merchants in place and all that kind of stuff. And so the first good news is that sales and revenue will be more connected in the SMB corporate pay business than they are in the middle market. 
 And I think the point that -- the question you asked, the point that we make is a super good one, which is the missing capability, I think Napoli asked me this in the last call, but I couldn't tell them, "Hey, Ron, what are you missing to really be a gorilla here in corporate pay?" And I didn't want to say, the answer is an SMB killer software app that works for the little company because we have the rest of the stuff. We acquire tons of clients with our sales channels. We've got capital. We've got processing capability. We've got the merchant networks to monetize. So we -- obviously, clients, the sell-up they do, they'll listen to us. 
 And so unlike Roger, when I met the principals there who were kind of on the road with a super good product kind of hanging out on their own, you take their super good product and you embed it into these sets of things we have. I mean, we are -- I said it, half kiddingly in the remarks that this could be kind of the biggest deal of all because finally, we have a product that matches up with some of our capabilities. I mean, no one ever asked me before, but how funny that FLEETCOR built the corporate payments business in the middle market when the whole company was an SMB company. And so it just took us a while to pair up the corporate payments business with the business that we built over the last 20 years. 
 And so the headline is, we've arrived. We have it. So I think without getting way over the skis here that this is a super big deal directionally for the company over the next 3 to 5 years of just building this thing out, where both walk-around plastic and payables sit inside the same client, where we stitch together effectively our fuel card business and our corporate payments business in the same client. It's not a small idea in our mind. It's a big idea. 
Operator: Our next question is from Bob Napoli with William Blair. 
Robert Napoli: Appreciate the call-out there, Ron. Just a quick question, I know we're getting at the end here. But the sales -- the increase in sales investment that you're making in, is this something that is onetime in nature? Or is the idea here in conjunction with your transformation to accelerate growth, increase investment in sales that will ramp up the sales growth rate over the long term and in line with the transformation, focusing on the higher growth product lines? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes is the short answer. The increment is recurring. And then if you looked at our 3-year plans, you'd see a similar kind of increase, 15% plus in sales in our '22 plans. So yes, it's recurring. 
 And I'd say the second part is it does come in a couple of forms. It comes in: a, the old fashion form of just more scale, so more outbound phone callers, more field people, more digital, Google search keywords. 
 But I'd say that the nuance that's different is we're going to make more investments kind of in digital, kind of at the top of the funnel. So we're going to spend more money to create more engagement as we have this broader product set now. And so having more things to sell, I think, allows us to spend some money earlier in people's decision cycle than at the end. So we tested that in Q4 last year, and it's working. And so that's some decent part of the step-up in '21, kind of a different kind of spend, Bob, for us than historically. 
Operator: Our next question is from Trevor Williams with Jefferies. 
Trevor Williams: I just wanted to ask on expenses. So just maybe for Charles, regardless of where you end up in the organic range, I mean, should we expect expense growth really to look similar to whatever you end up doing on the top line? Or could there be a level at which you might start to see a little bit more op leverage? So I'm just trying to think about how much we could see flow through to earnings if you do get a big snapback in volumes in the second half. 
Charles Freund: Yes. So I think when you look at our Q1 guidance, you see a bit of a reset of certain line items, whether it's the bad debt reserve or our anticipation of bad debt kind of eking out through the quarters and commensurate with our sales performance. Some of the snapback in terms of T&E, right? When the world opens up, are people going to travel like others do? Our bonus accruals and such. There's kind of like a re-level-set in this Q1 and then moving forward from there. So that's part of it. 
 To your point, though, when the volume does come back that's COVID-related and that revenue does pour in, it will come in at a higher margin level. But offsetting that are some of these incremental investments that Ron mentioned, right? We're layering in more sales and marketing for our core products. We're hiring in a lot of sales and marketing for Roger and our cross-sell efforts. So I'd say it's going to be pretty balanced in my view as we go through the quarters of the year. 
Trevor Williams: Okay. Got it. That's really helpful. And then just a quick clarification on the guide. I mean, it looks like you're implying the share count to be roughly flat year-over-year, so really no buybacks baked in, at least to the earnings guide. So just curious if there's any reason in particular why we shouldn't expect you to be buying back stock next year? Or if there's just some element of conservatism that's baked in there? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. It's Ron. So clearly, we build plans in terms of our capital allocation as though we're going to basically retire debt, right, take the principal down. And so to your point, to the extent the capital allocation results in another transaction, another acquisition where we buy earnings, or b, we buy back stock, to your point, the capital allocation can take up our earnings. So the guidance that we have now assumes that the roughly $1 billion of cash flow would basically retire debt during the year, which my guess is that I'm hoping to a year from today, Trevor, that's not what we do, to your point, the next 12 months. But since those 2 decisions are in the future, we plan what we know, which is to pay down debt. 
Operator: I believe this concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn it back over to management for closing remarks. 
James Eglseder: Yes. Thanks, everybody. Apologize if we didn't get to your question, but let us know if you have any incremental questions. And we look forward to working together in the quarter. That's all. 
Operator: This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-11-05 17:30:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the FLEETCOR Technologies Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
 I would like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Jim Eglseder, Head of Investor Relations for FLEETCOR Technologies. Thank you. You may begin. 
James Eglseder: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our third quarter 2020 earnings call. With me today are Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO; and Charles Freund, our CFO.
 [Operator Instructions] Please note, our earnings release and supplement can be found under the Investor Relations section on our website at fleetcor.com.
 Throughout this call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than non-GAAP information at other companies. Reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today's press release and on our website as previously described.
 Now before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today may include forward-looking statements. This includes statements about our recovery and outlook, new products and fee initiatives and expectations regarding business development and acquisitions, among others. They are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore, you should not put undue reliance upon them. These results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.
 Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release, on Form 8-K and on our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available on our website and at sec.gov.
 With that out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay, Jim. Thanks. Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining our third quarter earnings call. Upfront here, I plan to cover 4 subjects, so first, provide my perspective on Q3 and our Q4 outlook; second, provide an update on our AFEX cross-border acquisition; third, I'll discuss our plans for pivoting the work of the company in getting back on offense; and then finally, I'll close with some preliminary thoughts on next year.
 Okay. So let's start with our Q3 results. So earlier, we reported Q3 revenue of $585 million, that's down 14%, and cash EPS at $2.80, that's down 10% versus last year.
 We did manage operating expenses down 9% in Q3 versus last year, obviously, to minimize the impact on our bottom line. The macro, not helpful in the quarter, primarily weaker Brazilian FX, we estimate that it depressed our Q3 print revenue by approximately $33 million. Organic revenue growth, overall in the quarter, down 12% versus last year, but that is a sequential improvement of 5% from Q2. 
 Corporate pay also improved sequentially, their revenue, down 11% in Q3 versus was down 17% in Q2. We did see a step rate improvement in what we call same-store sales or client softness between Q2 and Q3. So softness improved to minus 8% in the quarter versus minus 17% in Q2. So that's a pretty significant softness recovery point-to-point, or said another way, increased client usage.
 Good news on the client retention front, we improved a point there to 92%, highlights to us again that all of the weakness is attributable to client softness. Sales recovering further here in Q3, finishing at 80% of the prior year. That's up from 54% of the prior year in Q2. Inside of that, our corporate pay sales in the quarter finished at 100% of the prior year, so nice rebound there. 
 Credit performance, nothing short of outstanding. Our Q3 credit losses finishing lower than last year and even $8 million better sequentially than Q2. 
 So look, in summary, Q3 clearly a better quarter for us than Q2. Volumes, step rate recovery, client softness, rebounded client retention, even in these wacky times ticking up a point. Sales starting to get back to normal, recovering to 80% of last year. We are managing expenses down. And our credit performance, again, really strong. Really pleased with credit. So all in all, an improving performance. 
 So in terms of transitioning to expectations for Q4, really just share a couple of thoughts. Historically, FLEETCOR's Q3 and Q4 performance has been pretty similar in terms of revenue and earnings because weakness from seasonality or fewer business days is generally offset by the business growth that comes online throughout the year. But this quarter, I mean, we're really not sure what to expect, whether volumes will further recover or whether they'll just flatten and plateau where they are. 
 So we are planning a couple of things. We're going to manage operating expenses down about 10% to 12% below last year. And we are forecasting sales to further strengthen, hopefully coming in more than 90% of the prior year. So it's a bit of a wait and see. 
 Okay. Let me make the turn to AFEX, the B2B cross-border payment company that we signed up and announced in September. So it's a bit of a Cambridge look-alike. About 2/3 the size of Cambridge in revenue, although far less profitable, was a grower, growing preteens pre-COVID, and it's outlook in 2020 performance to be about flat with 2019. The rationale for the deal, really pretty straightforward. It's a business that we know and like. It's a business growing on its own, with obviously a big TAM. And as we mentioned in the press release, a business that's quite complementary to ours as it strengthens our position in Europe and Asia. 
 So our conviction in the AFEX synergy plan is quite high, having just run this drill a few years ago with Cambridge. And so once closed, integrated and really fully run-rated, we're expecting accretion in the $0.25 to $0.50 cash EPS range, so we think a good contributor. So in terms of timing, we're still tracking to a Q1 2021 close, obviously subject to customary regulatory and antitrust approvals. 
 Okay. My next-up subject is kind of pivoting the work of the company and getting back on offense. So like lots of companies, we've been quite consumed with our COVID response work, lots of energy against that, and feeling we're coming out the other side, and now we can kind of redirect our energies to certain things. And so those certain things are, one, sales. Super focused on getting sales back, and you see a bit of the recovery, kind of 50% sales production versus last year in Q2, 80% this quarter, Q3, and hopefully getting to above 90%. So some evidence that sales performance is returning to normalized levels. We are making investments now in anticipation of next year, adding salespeople and making some select digital investments. And we have, since we talked last, reopened credit to pre-COVID levels across a lot of our businesses in an effort to improve our approval rates. 
 We're back on the tech front. We've stepped back up investments in tech, particularly around digital tech investments. So we've developed and launched a new client UI, getting very favorable user experience scores back. It's a mobile-centric platform. So really, a big improvement in the client-facing front end. We're getting better at using API layers to speed, interfaces and connections to partners and accounting systems, which helps us with our ERP integrations that contributes a lot of leads in our corporate payments business. So tech, back on. 
 Interestingly, we've begun to embrace electric vehicle recharging in Europe. We've actually added EV networks in the U.K., the Netherlands and Germany. And these EV networks basically complement the traditional fueling networks because the clients are keen to have their program, their total purchases consolidated across their mixed fleet, and they want that data all in one place. 
 So surprisingly, the economics are kind of okay of EV. And mixed fleets, it's literally almost neutral to us. We continue to get card fees for the electric vehicles. We get higher MDR rates when they're in the charging network. And we even get subscription fees to monitor and report on at-home and at-work charging. So look, at least initially here, we seem advantaged as an integrator or consolidator as clients transition their fleets to EV. 
 And then in terms of acquisitions, we're back pretty aggressively on the acquisitions front. So in addition to AFEX, we are chasing a couple new deals that are in and around our corporate payment space. And so comfortable with our liquidity and management capacity to get after those. 
 Okay. So last up today is really us looking into next year, into 2021. So I do want to point out a few signs of optimism for us in the setup. So one, we obviously had a big impact from COVID on client softness. So we do expect further COVID recovery of volumes and revenue from existing clients, and that's incremental to what we've -- the recovery that we've already seen. 
 Two, again, sales, we do expect those to be up significantly. Already seeing some of that, and that will contribute way more in-year revenue from new business. Third, we're back resuming our Beyond initiatives, which are cross-sell efforts really to get additional revenues out of existing clients. So we expect, again, incremental contribution from that. 
 Fourth, our trends, particularly client retention and credit, roll forward into next year. So super, super helpful as we outlook '21 performance. And then lastly, on the deal front, we will -- we do expect to close the AFEX acquisition and, as I mentioned, maybe even a couple of more. So some new deals maybe in the mix in 2021. So look, all in all, some -- we think, some positive factors in our setup for next year. 
 So with that, let me turn the call back over to Chuck to provide some additional detail on the quarter. Chuck? 
Charles Freund: Thank you, Ron. I'm happy to be here on my first earnings call as CFO. I'd like to note that in an effort to streamline my prepared remarks, all of my rates of change are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. So let's get into it. 
 The third quarter of 2020 was affected by COVID-related business slowdowns, but to a lesser degree than what we experienced last quarter. As such, we reported revenue of $585 million, down 14%. GAAP net income decreased 16% to $189 million, and GAAP net income per diluted share decreased 12% to $2.19. 
 As usual, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial metrics, such as adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share, and a reconciliation to GAAP numbers is provided in Exhibit 1 of our press release. 
 Adjusted net income for the third quarter of 2020 decreased 14% to $242 million. And adjusted net income per diluted share decreased 10% to $2.80. We're well-positioned to bring business back in conjunction with economic recoveries. I'm pleased with our ability to effectively manage expenses and minimize the negative impacts on our bottom line. 
 From a macro perspective, third quarter of 2020 results reflect the negative year-over-year impact of approximately $33 million in revenue. The macro was driven mostly by lower foreign exchange rates, primarily the Brazilian real, which we believe had a negative impact of approximately $28 million. 
 Fuel prices were also down year-over-year for the quarter, which we estimate had a negative impact on revenue of approximately $9 million, while fuel spreads had an estimated $4 million favorable impact. Organic revenue in the quarter was down 12% overall, primarily due to same-store sales being down 8%. Our fuel category was down organically about 11%, net of the impact of the unfavorable macro. There are a lot of moving parts in our fuel businesses around the world, but as you can see on Page 8 of the supplement, volumes in our international businesses have recovered more than volumes in the U.S. fuel businesses generally, as the international economies had reopened to a greater degree than here in the U.S. 
 The corporate payments category was down approximately 11% in the third quarter. Approximately 8 points of the decline was driven by significant softness in a small portion of our over 9,000 customers. These 100 customers exhibited the highest percentage year-over-year decline in revenue during the COVID pandemic. Lower spending on our T&E product drove the other 3 points of the organic drag. 
 You'll notice in the earnings supplement that we've included a new slide on Page 9 to clearly illustrate this point. And that aside from those 100 customers and T&E card activity that have been overly affected by COVID, our corporate payments business is actually flat to last year, so holding up quite well. 
 Now looking at the corporate payments category by the nature of our offerings, virtual card volumes were flat for the quarter, which was an improvement from down 12% last quarter as political spend and the benefit of new customers offset the drag from the highly affected customers. Cross-border or FX-related volumes were still down in the mid-single-digit range as payment volumes are still being affected by lower invoice levels, specifically in manufacturing and wholesale trade. 
 It's important to note here that our cross-border business is very different from that of Visa and MasterCard, which is mostly focused on consumers who are traveling between countries. Our cross-border business is facilitating payment for international trade and not dependent on a recovery in travel. 
 Full AP continued to perform very well, with volume up 20%. New sales of Full AP were very strong as we sold more than 3x compared with last year, due to both direct and reseller wins. 
 Now moving to tolls, which continues to be our most resilient business, and grew organically at 3% in the third quarter, stable with last quarter, as the subscription-based revenue model has not been significantly impacted by the COVID-driven slowdown in the Brazilian economy. Active toll tags were up 5% in the quarter, as our new approaches to tag sales, including selling at the toll plazas again and the introduction of our low frequency plans, are offsetting the lower sales in the malls and stores. Parking volumes have declined due to work-from-home, but fuel and drive-through volumes have begun to recover as residents have started to resume normal activities. 
 The lodging category was down 32% organically in the third quarter, with 9 points of the drag caused by the inclusion of the acquired airline lodging business in the year ago period. Our workforce business has outperformed our airline business as we expect workforce to see continued improvement as business activity recovers. We did see lower margins in the quarter as the large enterprise accounts with lower rates recovered faster than small business accounts. 
 Additionally, we saw some rate compression as hotels cut prices due to slow business and low occupancy levels, which also affected revenues. As for the airline lodging business, that recovery will likely be slower, and it is linked to the recovery of the airline industry. 
 Now moving down the income statement. Total operating expenses were down 9% for the third quarter of 2020 to $321 million. Our target was to reduce expenses in the high single-digit range year-over-year, which is exactly what we delivered. The decrease was primarily due to lower volume-related costs, lower employee-related costs, from reduced headcount, lower sales commissions and lower T&E expenses in addition to the impact of foreign exchange rates. 
 As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses were approximately 54.8%, a roughly 470 basis point improvement from last quarter. Bad debt expense in the third quarter of 2020 was $13.5 million or 6 basis points compared to $14.6 million or 5 basis points in the third quarter of 2019. Bad debt levels continued to be good and our aging roll rates are very favorable. That said, the uncertainty around the timing and level of government stimulus and various responses to increasing COVID cases around the world is still a consideration. 
 Interest expense decreased 14% to $31.4 million, driven by decreases in LIBOR related to the unhedged portion of our debt and lower borrowings on our securitization facility as a result of both lower volumes and lower fuel prices in the third quarter. This was partially offset by the impact of additional borrowings for share buybacks. 
 Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2020 was 19.8%, with a reduction from last year, driven primarily by incremental excess tax benefit on stock option exercises. 
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.37 billion in total cash, of which approximately $582 million is restricted and consists primarily of customer deposits. As of September 30, 2020, we had $3.8 billion outstanding on our credit facilities, and $688 million borrowed in our securitization facility. 
 I would note that in the quarter, we received a commitment to extend our $1 billion securitization facility for another year upon expiration in November. So we have plenty of capacity to support future growth. In total, we have approximately $1.6 billion of total liquidity, consisting of available cash on the balance sheet and our undrawn revolver at quarter end. 
 The primary change in liquidity from last quarter was the termination of the short-term $250 million bridge loan we had put in place, which we terminated due to lack of need for the incremental liquidity at this time. We remain committed to a consistent program of capital allocation using our free cash flow for acquisitions and buybacks. In the quarter, we repurchased 1 million shares at an average price of $238, which essentially used the free cash flow we generated in the quarter. 
 We also announced the acquisition of AFEX for $450 million that Ron discussed earlier. Some of you may have thought we forgot how to do M&A the FLEETCOR way. Clearly, that is not the case. We view this as a classic FLEETCOR deal that you've come to expect from us. We're disciplined, so deals will remain lumpy. 
 As we've shown, we believe that we have ample liquidity to pursue any near-term M&A opportunities, while still opportunistically buying back shares when it makes sense, like we did this quarter. I would also note that in October, our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase authorization by $1 billion. 
 And lastly, we had approximately $18.1 million of CapEx in the quarter, and finished with a leverage ratio of 2.77x trailing 12-month EBITDA as of September 30. 
 Finally, I want to remind everyone that our businesses are very resilient. They have all declined due to the COVID pandemic, and they've also recovered substantially from their low points. But due to the uncertainty we're seeing currently around reopenings versus shutdowns globally, we are still not in a position to provide guidance at this point. We do expect to manage expenses 10% to 12% below the fourth quarter of last year in order to balance current profitability with investment for future growth. 
 Operator, we'll now open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Could you provide some inter-quarter -- common intra-quarter trend commentary kind of what you're seeing in the business right now relative to Q3 levels? 
Charles Freund: Ramsey, this is Charles. Pleasure speaking with you this evening. So what we've seen inter-quarter is a bit lumpy. So we've got some stuff that's moving up, some stuff that's moving down. Hard to say kind of consistently what's going to go on here. 
 So Q3, I'd say, it was a good step up versus Q2. So pleased with that result, and quite frankly, did a bit better than what we initially had thought back in Q2. But in terms of inter-quarter trends, hard to really put a measure on it there. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. Fair enough. Could you also give us some kind of updated commentary on what you're seeing in terms of rates of recovery and your kind of larger versus smaller customers? I know that, that differential in rates of recovery was having an impact on kind of revenue yields. But I'm just curious what you're seeing in your business now in terms of those smaller customers potentially starting to come back a little stronger or what have you? 
Charles Freund: Yes. It depends on the line of business. In our fuel business, we have seen a bit more recovery, particularly in trucking in the small fleet segment. Keeping in mind that the small fleets dipped down quite a bit more than the large fleets, so they've been coming back faster, but they're still not at the level of recovery of the large fleets. In our lodging space here in the U.S., we are still seeing that phenomenon, though, but the small customers are lagging the large customer recovery pretty significantly. 
Operator: And our next question is from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. 
David Togut: Good to see the corporate payments bookings reached 100% of year-ago levels. Can you frame for us whether this business might get back to meaningful growth in 2021? This historically has been your best growth engine, yet you called out the bookings performance and yet, about 100 clients or so are still quite weak. So can you help us think about the year ahead and where you might land in this business? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, David, it's Ron. I think it hinges totally on the kind of sick client group that we laid out in the supplement. So the sickest client in the T&E business way, way down, which is having that thing penciled out at minus 11% for the quarter, kind of flat without those. 
 So clearly, the non-T&E, non-sick people will be a growing business in 2021 as we look at the plans. The wildcard is how much of that softness that we're seeing still here in Q3 will come back. So that's the debate we're having, and we're obviously watching it closely. To Chuck's point, we saw a little encouraging sign intra-quarter there in virtual cars. It looked like it was getting a little bit healthier. 
 So I'd say -- it's not a super answer, but I'd say, if you park the 2 sick portions for sure, you will see, again, mid- to high-teens growth for the rest of that business. To your point, based on the sales and the forecast we have for Q4 is another good one. So the sales are clearly there to grow that business. 
David Togut: Got it. Appreciate that. And then just as a follow-up on capital allocation, you increased the buyback authorization by $1 billion and you're about to complete AFEX. How should we think about the year ahead in terms of share repurchase versus other meaningful M&A? 
Ronald F. Clarke: I'd say, probably, the philosophy, David, is the same as always. We do have a number of deals that we're working on, and I think we called it out in the press release, including a couple that are close-in, kind of late stage. So we're always balanced and right the liquidity that we need for the deals in front of us versus opportunistic on the share price. So I'd say, it's, a, function of those 2 things. If there's a lot of deals we like, we've got conviction in, we'll spend the money on that. And if people trade our stock to a price that -- where buyers will buy it back. So the goal was to give us the management, the flexibility to make those calls. But I think, Chuck, our liquidity or availability is still well north of $1 billion? 
Charles Freund: Yes. Yes. 
Ronald F. Clarke: So we do have plenty to go, and obviously, the ability, David, to borrow more money. So capital [ isn't ] the main question for us. 
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang Wang with JPMorgan. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: So I want to ask, Ron, on the new sales, the bookings also. Just I'm curious, do you see some pent-up demand there potentially? And I'm just curious on your confidence in being able to replenish the pipeline now that you get to some kind of new normal and new rhythm on selling in this -- during this pandemic, as you see it. What's going on in the ground there? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I'm not sure on the sales thing. It's -- I used the word tension, but It's pent-up demand. I'd say that it's 2 things. One, that the marketplace, the prospect universe is kind of getting back to listening again. They're less distracted. So what we do, we go in and analyze and that Google Analytics package, search volumes across all of our categories against baselines. And we see in that outside-in data the planet getting more receptive again to the kinds of things that we offer. So that's point one, which is obviously super important. 
 And then point two, I think we finally have the rhythm of how to sell. We all ran home and fuel people became phone people, and we remixed more money to digital. And we shrunk credit, now we've opened credit. So I think we ying-ed and yang-ed in our various channels, and now we've got kind of a sense of how to do it, how to play the game as it is now. 
 And so this 80% number, which was pretty good in lots of places, particularly in corporate pay, I'm looking at a forecast that's over 90% for Q4. We've obviously got one of the months in the can. So I'd say of all the areas, that's the one where I feel like we have more control over our future. We stay in this kind of a place, the fact that we can continue to move that number up as we roll forward, so pretty confident. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Okay. I got you. Because I know in the past, you said you can -- you're pretty -- when you're confident, you throw in dollars on the sales side and you'll get the return. I know you're talking about double-digit OpEx savings. But does that signal that you're not quite ready to deploy capital towards the sales and marketing point? Or is that a different discussion? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. We are -- the reason -- I don't know on the disclosures how much detail we give you, but one of the reasons it looks like there's not a step-up in sales and marketing is the commission rolls are soft, right, because of the bad performance in Q2 and now just improving performance. 
 But we made the call probably 60 days ago to start to step-up investments, both in people, on the recruiting front and a certain kind of new digital campaign. So no, it's -- again, it's the one -- it's the key to the company, right? When you get all done with this softness, sickness thing of who is healthy and who is not, we still have a business you can plan, right? Whatever you give me, that baseline and then we lap whatever the softness or hardness is, we got a business that we can run 10% on the top. And so we're back at that game trying to build a sales plan for next year that keeps the company rolling in that fashion. And it's -- I mean, what I'd say back is that's a bunch of words, but more importantly, when 90%, 50%, 80%, and we're forecasting above 90%, so there's real evidence that it's working. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Okay. No, I'm sure that's the case. Last quick one, I'm sorry for asking a third one. Just the Cambridge playbook applied to AFEX. I mean is it very similar? I mean you sound pretty confident in getting that level of the normal accretion with AFEX. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean we -- this is a thing called down the fairway. But number one, that playbook, which is part of our model for every deal, worked quite well. I mean I think we reported or in one of these calls, I told you that we've more than doubled the profitability of Cambridge between '17 and '19. And so the first point is, yes, we'll reinstitute that same playbook for AFEX. 
 But then the second one is, that there's 2 businesses now that look the same. So there's a second bite of synergies in the combinations that we didn't have obviously in the Cambridge deal. So that's why we gave the range. Obviously, our thinking is the 2 steps of thing, make sure we understand it. So we'll run them. And we started the planning for that thing to get to first phase. And then as we get smarter, for example, they've done a small business in North America in a management layer, call it, the last 10%, 15% of the Cambridge business we have. So we'll clearly assimilate things like that, and they have way stronger positions in Asia. So it sets up really well, both to grow the business and to make it way more profitable, so we like it. 
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Steven Wald with Morgan Stanley. 
Steven Wald: Maybe coming back to the corporate payments, I know we've asked a lot about this, but from a different angle. You guys had previously said, I think, back in September, Charles, you were talking about sort of working through some of the backlogs on previous bookings and getting those up and running at a faster clip than perhaps it would typically be done at over a sort of 12-month-plus period. 
 I'm curious how we're thinking with a large chunk of the business outside of T&E being back to pre-COVID levels. How are you thinking about the potential for that to hockey stick up, now having gotten back to even from the onboarding of those volumes? It seems like there's a natural beneficial mix shift away from T&E just by virtue of the fact that it's subdued in activity. So what are you thinking in terms of the next 3 to 9 months from those faster implementations? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, that's, Steven, a super, super good question. I mean I think some of the softness this year at 2020 is not only sales, but what you said in that business implementations, because we kind of sell the year before and then implement the year after. And so a number of implementations in that business have been stalled, slowed as we certainly went through the second quarter and are starting to kind of reactivate. So the million-dollar question there, just like David's earlier is, how many of those implementations will hold? Will people stay with them if they agree to do the thing 3 or 6 months ago? And will they be away from their distractions where they could work hand and hand with us to implement the thing?
 So I think it's the same -- a bit of the same question, which is we've got a book of business that we can convert into revenue there, but we need cooperation of the clients that have agreed. So to the extent that they're agreeable, that, back to your point, will accelerate some of the recovery next year. And to the extent that it doesn't, they quit on the thing or they continue to back burner it, then that won't be helpful. So I think we're just seeing now signs in the last month or 2 of those implementations kind of getting back to a targeted level. 
Steven Wald: Very helpful. And then just squeezing in a quick follow-up here. You mentioned at the beginning of the call, getting back to work on the Beyond initiatives. And I think it's pretty straightforward, with the fuel piece in terms of cross-selling sort of more attached to those customers. But could you just speak to the conditions on the ground you're seeing on the Brazil side for Beyond? And obviously, there's been quite the disruption from the pandemic there. I'm kind of curious what the ability is to have those conversations and get the uptake in Beyond in Brazil. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I think the Brazil and the other ones, we did slow things down mostly around our credit paranoia back when this thing first broke. So we've obviously relaxed that, and then be just their population getting back out and about, right, driving around, refueling, going to fast food places, going back into the city, and they had a big closure like we did here in terms of their malls and stuff. So it was a real slowdown in the Beyond areas, right, of fueling, parking and fast food. 
 That's kind of recovered. They've kind of reopened the country. So we're seeing those transaction volumes tick back up. And we're also seeing it on new sales. I think you've heard that a big part of that initiative is to attract people that are kind of in the city that aren't toll people that want to use those things. Well, obviously, when there's no need to use those things, it's not as interesting a pitch. So we're seeing it in the last month or 2 that gets resonating again as the activities picked up. So I wouldn't say it's all the way back to pre-levels, but it is way back from where they were in Q2. 
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. 
Ashish Sabadra: I also would like to focus on the corporate payment. But I would like to go back to the Slide 8, where we have the volume trends by individual segment. My understanding was virtual card and FX were like almost 40% each, and then T&E and full AP at 10% each of that business. So when we do a bottom-up, we don't see the kind of 18% volume decline or 11% revenue weakness. What could we be missing when we think about it, about that weakness there? 
James Eglseder: Yes, Ashish, we're probably going to have you back you on that and do some math. This is Jim. Happy to do that, but I'm not sure that we have the disconnect [indiscernible] 
Ronald F. Clarke: Say the question -- Ashish, it's Ron, just so I got it again? 
Ashish Sabadra: Maybe a broader question would be just within the segment, I understand you talked about some of the weakness in the top 100 customers. But within the subsegment, were there any particular areas other than T&E, which has been relatively weak, which has been like weighing on the growth in that segment? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. You're saying the difference between the volume recovery versus the revenue? I mean I'd say in the virtual card business, a lot of it is mix that some of our channel partners that have lower revenue to us per spend dollar have recovered more, think of the people that are investing lots in sales and marketing. And then obviously, we have, again, some series of sicker clients and the -- unfortunately for us, they used to pay us more. 
 So I'd say that probably the biggest delta between that exhibit would be the mix. There's a fair number of pretty large clients on both sides of that wheel, some clients that are going up, like health care, as an example, would be like a perfect example. That had a, I don't have it in front of me, but a dramatic step up Q2 to Q3. It's kind of elective surgery and kind of normal hospital stuff kind of came back. And our margins in that health care business are way worse than in kind of the more traditional horizontal kind of a business. So that would be the partners, if you will, the wholesale business and the health care business have recovered better than some of the other businesses that pay us more. 
Ashish Sabadra: That's very helpful color, Ron. And then maybe just on the fuel. One of the questions that we get a lot from investors is the difference in the growth between your fleet -- fuel business versus what WEX has been reporting in terms of gallons. I was wondering if you could just provide any color on the difference. Is it more the customer mix? Any color on that front. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I keep saying -- I mean obviously, it's a super strange time and stuff. But I think if you said what's the most surprising thing to us is how well those businesses, both our domestic and international fuel have recovered. I mean the softness recovery, I'm not sure I have it in front of me, but literally, I think our international business existing clients, we call same-store sales, was down 25% or something literally in Q2, and recovered a ton. Again, I don't have it in front of me, but I think it is to 5%, picked up kind of 20 points or something in the improvement. So that would be something. And then even in the U.S., I think it's improved. If it was down 15% or 20%, it's down 10% or something. So that is what I'd say is the biggest thing. 
 Our applications are way up again because that Google outside-in, the world is more interested in searching again on fuel cards and fleet cards, so we're beneficiaries of that. Although, again, I think in the new business, we're still being a bit more careful in credit with the super small accounts, which tend to be in our fuel card business, is where we have smaller accounts. So we're still concerned with fraud and stuff. So we're being -- our approval rates are still lower in that line of business. 
 But it's doing, Ashish, I think, significantly better, particularly in the third quarter on the strength of the -- really, again, the clients coming back and the forecast from our guys are even more recovery there. So it's doing well. 
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Matt O'Neill from Goldman Sachs. 
Matthew O'Neill: Ron and Chuck, I was hoping I could first ask just to clarify a little bit further on the re-extension of credit. I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks that you're back to pre-COVID levels across a lot of the businesses. Was that still -- was that sort of a quarter end comment or kind of on average across the quarter? I'm just trying to think about how close we are to being back to normal? 
 And then as a follow-up, on the 10% to 12% expense reductions that you've discussed as far as balancing profitability this year, is there any expectation around parsing some of those that would be more permanent as we go forward versus are they predominantly transitory things? Isn't this year like T&E being down as a result of COVID, et cetera? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Let me, Matt, this is Ron, take the first half on credit, and then Chuck could take the expenses. I'd say that, no, it wasn't a green light at the beginning of the quarter where we turned the thing on. It's been very segmented. So we've moved at different speeds with different businesses. We've moved at different speeds with existing clients versus new clients. And we've moved at different speeds for super small clients, like we get in the fuel card business. 
 So when I said in the comment that we were kind of back, I'd say, we are. We've gone back to medium and large clients, and re-extended their terms, days to pay and stuff that we had shortened. We've increased some of the credit lines again, so we could get more greater share of their business. But we continue to be careful on some of the Beyond because obviously, that increases our credit exposure, our credit limits within a single client, right, which we view as a bit more risk. 
 And we continue to be cautious on the digital new business because they're coming in not as well as green as if they run through our people and they're smaller. So I'd say, it happened over the last 4 or 5 months, and sitting here today, it's probably, Chuck, I don't know, 80% or 85% back to normal with this Beyond and the small digital being the couple of exceptions. 
Charles Freund: This is Charles. Just the other point is we've kept some verticals that we know are still quite challenged due to the pandemic. We've kept them shut for credit purposes. Things that you would think of, right off the bat, heavy, heavy travel kind of industries, we're just not focused on them at this moment. 
Ronald F. Clarke: But we are tradable, Matt. When we see credit losses come in the way they have the last 2 quarters, we look and we see roll rates and all kinds of stuff that we look at and were like, huh, I guess we, along with some other people, maybe overreacted to the credit risk. And part of it is the essential nature, again, right, of what we do to people want to get our programs because it's part of their day-to-day jobs. 
 And then, b, the velocity of what our receivables are, we have all kinds of stuff like daily terms, daily net buys and stuff and trucking. So our terms are quite rapid. So we've been, again, just super fortunate. And so we're now trying to lean back towards the growth side and saying, okay, we're open to taking a bit more credit risk now that we see it's controlled. 
Charles Freund: And then, Matt, to your other question on the expense reductions and what's permanent or not, some of this is from volume. So as our volumes bounce back, whether it's the base coming back or enhanced sales, as Ron was saying, some of that volume-based expense will come back. Some of it is driven by FX rates. So it hurts us on revenue, but we save on expenses. And so unless we see the Brazilian real turn around, some of that's going to stick around for a while. 
 And we also mentioned our bad debt is running low, and the aging is also staying well below what it has been historically. And so you could see that kind of continuing to run at a low rate for some time. 
 I'd say, going forward into next year, we're going to continue to manage expenses, but look for opportunities, as Ron has said, to shift to growth and get on offense. So we'll look to deploy some of the things that -- some of the savings that we have this year to focus more on sales and marketing and get the top line where we want it. 
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. 
Robert Napoli: So the corporate payments business seems to be the key long-term driver to being able to hit the targets that you've had historically, Ron. What is the key -- strategically, what do you need to add to that business? I mean the opportunity is so large. And where are you investing? Because there's a lot of innovation going on in the corporate payment space. Where are you investing? What do you need to add? What are you looking at M&A-wise? What is most strategically important to keep that growth -- to make that business multiples the size it is today over the long term? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Bob, it's Ron. It's a good question. I think we described this business to you before, we look at it kind of like as a game board, so kind of chessboard, and it's got segments on it. So it's got kind of small, medium and large companies, and then it's got off to different verticals and stuff. And so if you look at the early days of the corporate pay or payables business, players are kind of going after certain cell. So some guy is focus on some verticals like us even, take construction, is a big part of our business. Some people like our pals, Bill.com, focused on super small clients and so on. 
 So the first thing I'd say to you is, we're acutely aware and focused on those, if you look at that game board, which ones were capable to be good at today and then what capabilities would we need to be good as some of the cells were not in. So there's a few verticals that we like, that I like a lot, that we'd like to be in, where there's connections to ERPs and client references that we need, so some opportunities maybe to buy into some of those. And then the same on size, right? One of the things we've debated is do we take our full AP product that's a super good product, but target it in the mid-market and make a down-market version, so that we can chase that to the 500,000 little clients we have with it.
 So I'd say that, that's -- the primary thing is widening the capabilities to play in more of those segments. And then, b, I think I told you in the prior calls, the running up the value chain, like, for example, getting good at invoice automation. So the client doesn't have to open 100 invoices and tear them open and somehow get them into their system, and then we help them pay it, but maybe be more helpful to them as they pull those invoices and digitize those invoices. 
 So those are the 2 games. We're going to get wider in the segments, and I'm hoping you'll hear more about that, and we'll get kind of broader in the value chain of the adjacency. So a year or 2 from now, you'll see us more in those 2 spots. 
Robert Napoli: Are you building the invoice automation piece internally? Or is that something that you need to acquire? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I'm not going to answer that, other than say, obviously, we always look at the made by, so we're analyzing all of those options. All I can tell you is, we'll have this. We're committed, to your point, to this space, and we're looking at the various ways to get wider in this game and we will be wider in this game. 
Operator: And our next question is from the line of John Coffey with Susquehanna. 
John Coffey: One -- sort of 2 questions, one of which is fairly basic. Looking at Slide 8, this is a little bit differently set up than it was last quarter. So I was just wondering, in this -- again, maybe obvious, the last column of growth, is this sequential growth from Q2 to Q3? I just want to make sure I understood that right. Or is it some other kind of maybe, I don't know, an early October number? 
 And then I'll just give you my second question right off the bat, is on the next slide. When I look at the declines that you see from the 100 most effective customers, would a lot of that be primarily driven by the T&E cards? Or would some of this be virtual cards as well? 
Charles Freund: John, this is Charles. So on Slide 8, what you're seeing there, the volume trends Q2 year-over-year and Q3 year-over-year, that third column is really the difference between Q2 and Q3. So sequentially, right, we improved, say as an example, in the local fuel business, from minus 17% to minus 12%, we improved 500 basis points. And so you can see kind of the recovery that we're seeing sequentially quarter versus quarter, Q2 to Q3 this year. 
 And then in terms of the 100 customers, in that slide, which is Slide 9, we're actually explicitly removing the T&E card product and looking at that separately. So the 100 most affected customers would be those that are using our payment products, either our virtual card or our cross-border and AFEX services. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I don't know, John, whether we're making this point clear why we put this thing in here. Again, no one understands this better than you guys of how COVID and shutdowns have helped some companies and hurt some companies and then super hurt some companies, the whole distribution. 
 I guess the headline we're trying to give is that partitioning of impact sits in our client base. So when we look at the business that we built, it's a function of the health of our clients. And so just like the investments that you guys look at, we have some set in all of our businesses of super sick clients that we didn't know could get so sick, using fuel cards or corporate pay products. 
 And so the softness and the down performance of our company is really, as we've said, mostly now just a function of the health of a narrow group of our clients because we're back selling, our retention is fine, our credit's fine. And so the other parts of our business that allow our business to go forward, fortunately, are kind of okay again. So it's really just -- the point of it is really just we have, in our 800,000 clients, ones that were massively impacted by this thing and continue to be. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of George Mihalos with Cowen. 
Georgios Mihalos: Ron, just wanted to ask, I know it's early days around sort of EV and the like, and you talked about some networks overseas. I'm just curious on your thoughts about that kind of migrating to the States. Maybe how far behind are we to that playing a bigger role? And then just secondly, it sounds like you're, at least for now, somewhat encouraged on the economics. Just your thoughts around the ability to sustain that? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Let me start, George, with the second question first and then come back to the U.S. I'd say this is another one a bit like our credit thing. Probably all of you were like, oh, sheez, FLEETCOR's got fuel cards, and oh my god, it's going to be electric vehicles and oh, they won't have any business or whatever. Okay. So we're like, oh my god, I wondered when a client that's got 20 plumbing trucks gets 2 or 3 electric vehicles, while our business go down 10% or 15%.
 So what I was really trying to report now that we're in the game is no. That example of a mixed fleet, our business is basically flat. And I'm studying this over the last 6 months. I'm like -- what is going on here, guys? And the answer is that the business wants to know about their vehicles and usage and purchases and what the people are doing, frankly, across the entire 20 vehicle population in that example. 
 And so having a card in a way that the 20 people can still all buy and get reported on one account, I guess we didn't really realize how valuable that was to companies, and they're willing to pay. They're still paying card fees on those 3 electric plumbing trucks and they're -- obviously, we're getting paid for the new networks we've established. And they even want to know when those things are getting charged because they have admin to do with their employees, right? Their employees want to kind of get reimbursed, if you will, for at-home charging, the gadgets and the electricity and stuff. And so the headline for everybody is, at least initially, while the fleets are mixed, it's not a big -- we don't view it as a big drag, which, to me, I want to tell that story because we think it's pretty good news. 
 On the second question, I think it's as much a government question as anything. Look, the reason that some of the countries we're in, in Europe are ahead in EV is the government has set it up that way, right, in terms of incentives and targets and stuff that they've set up. So maybe we'll know something tonight or tomorrow here about our government. But I think a lot of it, the pace at which the U.S. will try to catch up, I think, is going to be a function really of the incentives that are put out there, how high a priority it is. But again, my guess is the behaviors will be probably pretty similar to what we're seeing. Networks will get billed, networks that work will get billed, and we'll probably copy the same playbook for a while. So to me, it just keeps pushing out the electric vehicle impact on our company. 
Georgios Mihalos: Okay. That's great. That's very encouraging. And then, Charles, if I could sneak one more in, just looking at the full AP business, I think you grew 20% in the third quarter, that's good growth. But I think in July, volumes were up 27%. So I guess, you're sort of exiting the third quarter in the teens. Anything to kind of call out there and how maybe we should be thinking about that business near term? 
Charles Freund: Yes. So in terms of the 20% growth, I'm assuming you're referring to Slide 8, that is embedded volume growth. The business -- we are lapping some synergies that we put into place a year ago. So when we acquired the business, they had some payments that they were doing. But what we did is we basically tied that product to our vendor database, and so we could take a bunch of the payments they were making through other modalities and turn them on to our MasterCard virtual card. 
 And so we saw a lot of MasterCard spend suddenly come into the system. We're now lapping those synergies. And so what you're going to see basically in that business going forward is really just organic growth. It's sales pouring in. And in this case, it's transaction volume overcoming COVID softness in the base, since that big sales that we keep telling you about is layering on. And so we're going to have this kind of, call it, high teens, 20% kind of growth rate in this business, provided the sales continued. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Trevor Williams from Jefferies. 
Trevor Williams: And I just wanted to follow up, Charles, with you just a little bit on the expense comments you made to Matt's question earlier. I mean it sounds like you guys are going to start pouring some more fuel on the fire when you start to get more of a reacceleration on the top line. With that kind of framework, I mean, should we be thinking that maybe your incremental margins run a bit lower than the 70% level that we've historically thought about when revenues start to come back on the upswing? 
Charles Freund: No, I'd say, we're pretty disciplined and balanced. So it's not -- when you say pouring fuel on the fire, everything we do is going to be incremental. It will be balanced. But what we try to do as a company is shift what we call calories. So I can make certain investments in back office stuff. I can make investments in sales and marketing. I much prefer the latter versus the former. 
 And so we're very, very disciplined in cost control in all of our operations. And that way, we can put some disproportionate investment in sales and marketing, while still managing the bottom line effectively. So I would not anticipate any kind of dramatic changes in that regard. It's more of a shift in spending versus big incremental investment. 
Trevor Williams: Okay. Got it. That's very helpful. And just one other clarification question for me. Ron, I mean you -- when you're talking about the fourth quarter, you're hoping to get sales up to 90% of last year's level. I just want to make sure I'm understanding that comment correctly. Is that new sales you're referencing? Or is that -- you're talking about revenue growth being down 10% or hopefully a little bit better for the fourth quarter? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, that's new sales, Trevor. So we keep track of what we call annualized new business. We sign up 30,000 clients in the quarter, how much revenue will they create. And so we have a system that measures that. So yes. So I say, hey, we were 50% of new business. Now Q3, we're at 80%, and we hope to be at 90% or 90%-plus, that's comparing new business we got in Q3 this year to the amount of new business we got in Q3 last year. 
Trevor Williams: Got it. Okay. That makes sense. That's why I asked. Appreciate it. 
Ronald F. Clarke: I mean let me go back to what I said earlier that Togut asked, which is, once you normalize this base softness or wherever it is, this is -- I want to make sure everyone gets it, this is the game. If you could get sales, right, to be more than attrition, and we said retention ticked up a point, it is the key to planning this machine running forward. So we will lap the softness, even though we're recovering some. So I don't want people to miss how important this metric is to us and to the revenue growth going forward. 
Operator: And our final question comes from the line of Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. 
Mihir Bhatia: I just had one quick one, hopefully, on fuel card -- on the fuel card segment. Thanks for the incremental disclosure on the corporate payment side. I was wondering if you could do something similar for us, like just at a high level, maybe on the fuel card side. Are there particular customers or segments that are just not recovering while everything else is getting better? 
 And then just relatedly, I was curious about your views just in terms of -- with parts of Europe and, I guess, the U.K. is talking about shutting down again or at least putting some kinds of movement restrictions in place. How should we be thinking about the headwinds from that for you next quarter? 
Charles Freund: So on the fuel card business, Mihir, we are still seeing some of that softness still in the small businesses, as we mentioned earlier, so that's still -- waiting for that to come back. In terms of some of the industries, manufacturing has been a bit slow. Obviously, transportation as such, public transportation, things of that nature has been a little slow in our local fuel business. 
 The Europe stuff had bounced back more, as shown in our volume exhibits. To your point, we're watching the lockdowns. I think in terms of the nature of those lockdowns, they don't seem quite as severe, at least is what I've read in the press regarding how far they're going to shut down. So we're still waiting to see what that impact will look like. So I'd say, to be determined. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Let me just add to what Chuck said. The answer is yes to are there super sick clients like we show in corporate pay. We run the distributions of the clients. So let's say we had 100,000 clients, we basically put them in layers, call it, 5 or 6 layers, hey, 25,000 of the 100,000 have grown, hey, 25,000 are down like 5% or 10%, hey, 25,000 are down 20% to 30%, and then 6,000 are down 80% or more. 
 So we see the whole distribution of super impacted industries versus industries that were nicked by, we're going to have one less plumber because some homes won't accept them. So it's not quite as stark as it is in the corporate pay business. And again, it's why we've seen actually more recovery, if you will, of our same-store sales in the fuel business than in the corporate pay, because we have retailers and maritime payroll and hotels, things that don't move that have been shuttered that are in our corporate pay business. So we were just dealt a more impacted set of clients, effectively sitting in that business. 
Operator: And there are no further questions in the queue at this time. I will now turn the call back over for closing remarks. 
Charles Freund: Nothing further on our end, guys. Let me know if you need anything else, I'm always available. So have a good evening. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Thanks, everybody. 
Operator: That does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Thank you, and have a great day.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-08-06 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the FLEETCOR Technologies Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. 
 I would like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Jim Eglseder, Head of Investor Relations for FLEETCOR Technologies. Thank you. You may begin.

 With that out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our second quarter earnings call. 
 Before I begin my opening remarks, I do want to say a big thank you to my pal, Eric Dey, for making the FLEETCOR journey with me almost from the beginning. I think we've had a pretty good time together and enjoyed some success along the way. So all of us will miss you, Eric. 
 At the same time, I do want to welcome my other longtime partner, Chuck Freund, also with us from the very beginning, as he transitions into the new role of CFO. So Chuck's been involved in literally every aspect of the company. He's run some of our businesses. He's bought businesses. He's helped us plot the future. So I can assure you, he'll be a terrific CFO. 
 Okay. So back to my prepared remarks, in which I'll cover 4 subjects. So first, I'll report on the progress against the initial COVID response plan that we undertook. Second, I'll provide my perspective on Q2 results. Third, I'll speak to the trends, the line of business trends that we're seeing here in July, along with thoughts on rest of the year. And then lastly, I'll provide our perspective on Fleet's long-term prospects in a post-COVID world. 
 Okay. So let me begin by summarizing the progress against the COVID response plan that we put into motion in Q2. It was focused against 6 areas. So first was safety. So very pleased to report today, we've had very few positive virus cases among our 8,000 global employees. And fortunately, no one seriously ill, so very, very happy with that. 
 Two, on business continuity, we've been able to deliver our services in this new remote environment. And we can report again in Q2 that our systems performance and uptime were very good. 
 Three, credit. We're delighted, honestly, with our Q2 credit results. Came in at, I think, $21 million, which was about our original loss plan and receivables aging continues to look quite good. So a real bright spot so far. 
 Fourth, liquidity. We quickly tried to strengthen our liquidity back at the beginning of the quarter. We stepped up collections intensity. We repatriated cash. We even secured a bridge loan. So today, liquidity is quite good, $1.9 billion and our leverage ratio, 2.6x. 
 Expenses, we anticipated, obviously, weakness in Q2 so we trimmed expenses. We actually managed our expenses $50 million lower, which is 20% lower than the original plan that we built, so that cushioned our Q2 profits. 
 And then last is selling. We knew in this new remote world, we'd have to sell differently so lots of progress around targeting different kinds of companies, new ways to get leads, providing new tools for our salespeople to work at home, new monitoring approaches, so really a revamped selling model that started to rebound. 
 So I do want to give a shout-out really to all the FLEETCOR employees who jumped on these set of things. It was quite urgent to get at these things. So IT, HR, credit, sales management, really good performance. 
 Okay. Let me make the turn over to our Q2 results. So we reported Q2 revenue of $525 million, which is down 19% and cash EPS of $2.28, which is down 20% versus prior year. So our expense reduction actions helped narrow our profit decline. In terms of organic revenue for the quarter, finishing down 17% behind the prior year overall. Fuel coming in at minus 16% so about line average. Corporate pay at minus 17%. Lodging in total at minus 37% but the workforce portion, somewhere in the high 20s. And toll in the plus column, plus 3% for the quarter, driven by its subscription model. 
 In terms of trends in Q2, obviously affected by COVID, same-store sales, the big one, declined 17% so about the same as our organic revenue growth as we saw client softness really across every business. Thankfully, client retention remains stable at 91%. And new sales weren't great, about half of last year's level for the quarter but clearly rebounding as we move through the quarter. 
 So it's pretty hard to reflect on a quarter like this but kind of here is my conclusion. It's -- for us, it's really a story, Q2, of client softness. And client softness being way down as a result of COVID because if you look at other aspects of our business, they were generally kind of okay, retention stable at 91%. Feeling good about finding a new way to sell in this environment and confirm that we can keep selling our services in this environment. Credit didn't bite us, loss was about on plan. We flexed expenses down to keep profits kind of in line with revenue, right-sized the company. And we generated $200 million of free cash flow in the quarter. So a few bright spots. 
 Okay, let me transition to the trends that we're seeing in July and how we're thinking about the rest of the year. So we've included in the earnings supplement a line of business volume chart that runs through the last few months, including July. And you'll see there that really every business we have has at least bottomed out, and many of the businesses are recovering and recovering a bit more quickly in July. They're affected really by the entire client distribution. So clients that are down a little bit, clients that are down a medium amount, clients that are down a super lot. When we look at those distributions, they're all moving up, so all clients are kind of moving back up, adding volume. 
 So just a couple of callouts. You can see international fuel recovering very nicely as Europe out ahead of us on the COVID thing. And our high-growth businesses, full AP, tolls, Russia, simply just powering through their client softness because of lots of new business. So clearly, things getting better. 
 In terms of rest of year, we do expect continued improvement but we will still have challenges here short term. So volume, we think, will continue to recover but unclear as to how quickly. Our second half revenues will recover more slowly than volume and that's mostly because of mix. We're seeing larger enterprise clients with lower rates recover faster than our small business portfolio. We expect the macro, particularly FX, to continue to weigh on our second half year versus prior year. We do expect sales to continue to recover to get better. We're hopeful of getting back to 90% of prior year as we exit 2020. And then lastly, expenses, we plan to continue to manage expenses down here in the second half, targeting about 10% lower expense levels than prior year. So in conclusion, Q3 and 4 will be better than Q2 but again still challenging. 
 So last, let me transition here over to kind of a long-term view of FLEETCOR and how all of this impacts the company. I mean at the headline level, we think the new behaviors coming out of COVID will be a mixed bag. There's puts and takes. But the main point is we think that those new behaviors will impact us kind of at the margins, if you will, of our business. And at the core, because it's essential workers that keep powering on, that the core of our business will hold up quite well. So negative impacts that we expect long term is probably less white collar commuting long term, which again, will impact our European fuel card businesses a bit at the edges because some have white-collar fuel cards. Likely less business travel at least over the midterm, so that will dampen our T&E card business and our airline crew lodging business. And then the accelerated shift to digital and digital purchasing and away from face-to-face shopping will create pressure on our gift card business. 
 On the positive front, the whole work-from-home, remote working model certainly will drive demand for outsourcing, outsourcing of everything generally. So that will lift our payables business, we think, our virtual card and our full AP prospects. And the preference for touchless and avoidance of attendance, we think, will lift demand for really almost all of our card businesses. So fuel cards, pay at the pump versus in-store; Brazil nonstop electric tolls versus cash booths; payroll cards that are reloadable versus payroll checks; virtual cards instead of printing AP checks. 
 So look, again, the headline is that our view is that these impacts, we think, are at the margin and at the core of what we do is serve clients with essential workers and that there'll be continuing demand for good payment solutions for that group of clients. So what do we do? We wait for our clients and the world to recover here. We're going to stay focused on what we can control and what we can do. Namely, that's to advance the 3 main priorities, primary priorities of the company. 
 So one is portfolio. We're continuing to look at things to reposition our portfolio, create fewer, bigger businesses, add more nonfuel businesses, add more faster-growing businesses and likely more adjacencies. 
 Second, penetration of our big 4 businesses. We're working again to enhance our products, create more sales pressure, strengthen our cross-sell channels back to our clients. We're also pushing our Beyond strategy, which transforms our businesses and their TAM both through broadening what each business offers but more importantly maybe, the segments that each of our businesses can target. So for example, urban city dwellers in Brazil versus highway toll users or airline crew lodging versus only workforce people. 
 And then lastly, we're working on strengthening the base capabilities of the company, a particular emphasis on tech, on technology. So you'll see us invest more in IT, more in IT transformation. We'll move more applications to the cloud. We'll improve digital UIs and DIs for clients. We'll continue to advance our cybersecurity protection, so we'll continue to get better at IT. 
 So from our perspective, if we keep progressing these 3 priorities, portfolio, business penetration and our capabilities, it supports our ambition of a 15% to 20% profit growth company. 
 So look, in closing, Q2 -- our Q2 performance, again, really a story of same-store sales, client softness as a result of COVID, again with other aspects of our business, particularly retention and credit holding up nicely. Second half, for sure, better than Q2, but again still challenging, we think, over the short term. But I think most importantly, longer term, the message from us today is that the core, the main thing that we do around the world, which is to serve clients essential services, payments needs, we think that, that remains quite good, quite robust. And that we see puts and takes again around the margins of our business as it relates to COVID. 
 So with that, let me turn the call one more time back over to Eric to provide some additional details on the quarter. Eric? 
Eric R. Dey: Thank you, Ron. 
 For the second quarter of 2020, we reported revenue of $525.1 million, down 19% compared to $647.1 million in the second quarter of 2019. GAAP net income decreased 39% to $158.5 million from $261.7 million. And GAAP net income per diluted share decreased 37% to $1.83 from $2.90 in the second quarter of 2019. However, there were a couple of unusual items in the quarter that I want to call out. The second quarter of 2020 was impacted by a $9.8 million discrete tax item related to a prior tax position and a gain on the company's investment in Bill.com of approximately $34 million. Also, in the second quarter of 2019 was a tax benefit of approximately $65 million related to the sale of the company's investment in Masternaut. Excluding these discrete items, net income decreased 28% and net income per diluted share decreased 25%. 
 Non-GAAP financial metrics that we will be discussing are adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. And the reconciliation to GAAP numbers is provided in Exhibit 1 of our press release. Adjusted net income for the second quarter of 2020 decreased 23% to $197.4 million compared to $256.7 million in the same period last year. And adjusted net income per diluted share decreased 20% to $2.28 compared to $2.85 in adjusted net income per diluted share in the second quarter of 2019. 
 Second quarter of 2020 results reflect a negative year-over-year impact from the macroeconomic environment of approximately $22 million in revenue. The negative macro was driven mostly by lower foreign exchange rates, primarily in Brazil, when compared with the second quarter of 2019. We believe FX negatively impacted revenue by approximately $35 million. Fuel prices were down year-over-year for the full quarter, and although we cannot precisely calculate the impact of these changes, we believe it unfavorably impacted revenue by approximately $13 million in the quarter. And finally, fuel spreads were quite favorable for most of the quarter and had about a $26 million favorable impact in the quarter. Organic revenue in the quarter was a negative 17% overall, driven primarily by same-store sales softness of 17%. 
 All of our major product categories were impacted by the COVID pandemic in the quarter, some more than others. Our fuel category was down organically about 16%. There are a lot of moving parts to our fuel businesses around the world. Our fuel volumes in our international business were impacted more than the U.S. fuel businesses. Both geographies' volumes bottomed out in April, and we have been recovering in May, June and into July. Volumes should continue to improve over the remainder of the year, barring any setbacks in the reopening of the economy. And although volumes seemed they're recovering, revenues are recovering at a slower rate in the fuel category as large enterprise account volumes with lower rates are improving faster than our SMB accounts, which have higher revenue per gallon. 
 The corporate payments category was down organically approximately 17% in the second quarter. As a reminder, our corporate payments business is made up of virtual cards, cross-border payments, full-service AP accounts and physical T&E plastic, cross-sold mostly to our virtual card customers. The same-store sales softness in corporate payments came mostly from accounts in the travel, oil and gas, retail and elective health care verticals. We are seeing some recovery in verticals other than travel and the retail verticals, which we expect will recover at a slower rate. 
 Our full-service AP business continues to perform well and is growing in the mid- to high double-digit range. Our toll category has proven to be our most resilient business and grew organically at 3% in the second quarter. Most of the revenue in this category is subscription-based and has not been significantly impacted by the slowdown in the Brazilian economy due to COVID. The products that have been impacted are mostly the Beyond Toll products where we earn interchange, like parking, fuel and fast food, where volumes had decreased significantly. Our expectation is for these revenues to recover as the Brazilian economy starts to reopen and recover. 
 The lodging category is made up of our legacy lodging business, which provides lodging accommodation services to workforce travelers and emergency service organizations such as FEMA and the Red Cross. This business was down 29% organically in the second quarter. And our airline lodging business, which provides lodging accommodation services primarily to the airline crew and distressed passenger segments was down 68% in the quarter. Our expectation is for our workforce lodging business to see continued improvement as this business mostly provides lodging for blue-collar workers who generally drive vehicles to the hotel. This business has been impacted much less than other travel-related businesses. However, we do expect revenue in the category to recover slower as large enterprise accounts with lower rates are recovering faster than our SMB accounts. We expect our airline lodging business recovery to be slower and is linked to the recovery of the airline industry. 
 Now moving down the income statement. Total operating expenses were down 11% for the second quarter of 2020 to $312.3 million compared with $349.8 million in the second quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in costs related to decreases in volume, cost cutting initiatives implemented in the second quarter and the impact of foreign exchange rates. As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses were approximately 59.5% compared to 54.1% in the second quarter of 2019. Bad debt expense in the second quarter of 2020 was $21.3 million or 7 basis points compared to $18 million or 7 basis points in the second quarter of 2019. Bad debt has been one of the more surprising bright spots as our agings are mostly normal, particularly given the environment we are in today. Any increase in bad debt has been driven mostly by one-off bankruptcies versus increases in aging categories. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 12% to $62.2 million in the second quarter of 2020 from $70.9 million in the second quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange rates. Interest expense decreased 18% to $32.4 million compared to $39.5 million in the second quarter of 2019. The decrease in interest expense was due primarily to decreases in LIBOR related to the unhedged portion of our debt, partially offset by the impact of additional borrowing for share buybacks and lower borrowings on our securitization facility due to lower volumes in the second quarter. 
 Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2020 was 25.1% compared to a negative 1.7% for the second quarter of 2019. The second quarter of 2020 was impacted by a $9.8 million increase in the reserve for uncertain tax positions related to prior years. Also with the second quarter of 2019 was a tax benefit of approximately $65 million related to the sale of the company's investment in Masternaut. Excluding these discrete items, our tax rate would have been 20.4% in the second quarter of 2020, and the tax rate in the second quarter of 2019 would have been 23.6%. The decrease in the tax rate was due primarily to excess tax benefit on stock option exercises. 
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.19 billion in total cash. Approximately $426 million is restricted and consists primarily of customer deposits. As of June 30, 2020, we had $3.8 billion outstanding on our credit facilities and $654 million borrowed in our securitization facility. We believe that we have ample liquidity to weather any COVID scenario and to pursue any near-term M&A opportunities. In total, we have approximately $1.9 billion in total liquidity, consisting of cash on the balance sheet, undrawn revolver and the undrawn bridge loan. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 127,000 shares in connection with employee stock sales for $32.2 million as employees forfeited shares to cover taxes. And we have approximately $294 million in repurchase capacity remaining under our current authorization. As of June 30, 2020, our leverage ratio was 2.62x EBITDA, which is well below our covenant level of 4x EBITDA as calculated under our credit agreement. Finally, we spent approximately $19.4 million on CapEx during the second quarter of 2020. 
 Now turning to the outlook for the balance of the year. I want to remind everyone that although our businesses are very resilient, our businesses have all been impacted by the COVID pandemic, some more than others. Our business models are primarily recurring revenue in nature. We have very broad customer bases and diversified businesses across industries and geographies. We are not reinstating our guidance at this point. There is simply too much uncertainty regarding the resumption of business activity around the world to accurately predict what our volumes could be the rest of the year. 
 We do expect that second half of the year volume will continue to improve as the economy improves. However, we expect second half of the year revenues to recover more slowly than volume because larger enterprise accounts with lower rates will likely recover faster than our SMB portfolio. We also expect that the macro will continue to be a drag on revenue due to lower expected fuel prices and foreign exchange rates when compared to last year. 
 And finally, before I turn the call over for questions, I want to thank Ron for his kind words earlier. It has been quite a ride over the last 18 years. I have spent some time thinking about my FLEETCOR journey and really cannot believe everything that we have accomplished over this period of time, and I cannot think of many things I would rather have done. I have known Charles for a long time and I can say that there is not a person better equipped to take over this challenging role. I will be around to help with the transition over the next several months and look forward to catching up with many of you before I head off into the next chapter of my life. 
 And with that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Eric, let me add my thanks as well, it's been a fun ride. I can't believe it's been that long, so hopefully we can [ meet soon ]. 
 My question -- I think my first question is just thinking about, Ron, your comments and the 3 priorities. And you mentioned adjacencies as being a probable area. I was hoping maybe you could expand on that. Do you think of adjacencies similar to what you did with entering the tolling business? Or is it more like entering the AP automation side of things? Just trying to think about how far you might go when you think about adjacencies. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Tien-Tsin, sitting here next to Mr. Sentimental, so I share your sentiment. I can't believe how long [ you have been with us ]. All good things come to an end. 
 Yes. So the adjacency thing I mentioned, I guess, in the last call, so it came out of this idea of looking at the clients, kind of what they do before or after the payment. And so I gave the example last time in corporate pay and the payables business, all the front end of invoice, prep and workflow and approvals and all that stuff before we press the pay button. So we continue to look kind of at the front end of those things to see if we can be more helpful again to clients. 
 And another example would be kind of in the core fuel card business. And particularly with SMBs, there are other kinds of software, a little bit what the acquirers have done, First Data and Global are the software that nests around what our small business guys do. And an old example [ of work rate is telematics ]. So we were trying to figure out if there was another service, another software service close to fuel cards that dealt with steel SMB people. So we have a couple of things that we're looking at there, where there's some software that's in the categories, in the verticals that we're in. 
 So again, the thought of it is not only to be more helpful to the clients that we've got to do more for them but also from the selling perspective, right, that those adjacencies bring books of clients that we could cross-sell to so it may help us sell as well. So those would be a couple of examples. So in each one of [ the areas, we decided kind of the front and the back ] around our services. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Got you. Okay, that's good to know. My follow-up real quick and I'll get off the call. Just on the new sales visibility. Obviously, these new sales were impacted this quarter. Just as we think about replenishing in the second half of the year, how much visibility do you have there and just sort of the quality of the sales that you see as we -- as you get beyond the summer? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Tien-Tsin, you broke out just a little. Can you -- if you can hear us well, can you repeat the question? 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Yes, sorry. I know my cell signal's bad. I have no power on that. Just the new sales outlook and visibility and your confidence in replenishing that as you exit the year, any additional color there? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I think that -- I heard that now. I think it's a great question. So first thing is it's better already, right? So I think I reported that it was around half for the quarter, so it was a little better than June and we're starting to peak at the July numbers. So the first headline is it's better already. And I think second is we've kind of figured out the new things which took us some time in Q2, right? You've got to pitch different people. You got to find leads in different ways. You're not going to trade shows. So you're still making right in not calling face-to-face. So I think the toolkit for people and the cadence and the way of selling is starting to pay some returns early. And the forecast that we've got from people, again, is getting back to, call it, 90% as we head towards the end of the year. So -- I mean I got to tell you, we're delighted, honestly, that we found a way to engage people enclosed in this world. I mean it -- there was a point there where we weren't super sure. So now it's really just a question of whether we get sales kind of back to where they were. 
 Again, it won't impact a ton our revenue in 2020. As you know, a number of our businesses, we sell, we contract in advance of implementation. So some businesses are more sell and go live, and other businesses are sell and go live a different day. So the key to it is to fill the end of the year, so that, that can [ forward to ] 2021. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Got you. Understood. 
 And Eric, I promise, I won't ask you how to calculate the fuel spread in your retirement then. 
Operator: And we'll go next to Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. 
Ramsey El-Assal: And Eric, also wish you the very best. I appreciate all your help over the years. 
 I wanted to follow up on Tien-Tsin's question on M&A first. And irrespective of the deals that you'd like to do, it's such a strange environment where a lot of the valuations for some of the -- kind of your tech assets are really run. What is the pipeline looking like? Are there deals out there that you think are workable? Or is this sort of proven not to be the time for sort of opportunistic M&A? Just curious about the broader kind of M&A environment you're seeing there, Ron. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. It's a good question. So I guess I'd categorize the pipeline kind of into 3 buckets. So one is we continue to look at deals, right, in our big 4 categories, so there's other providers that do the same things. And so obviously, we're in conversations with other players that are in those spaces. And two, I think I mentioned the last time, there's a handful of kind of coveted assets that sit inside some distressed companies, so we're chasing a couple of things. I think I mentioned that wouldn't have been available probably a different day where it makes more sense for the companies to talk to us. 
 And then last is going back to Tien-Tsin's question. We are engaged with a handful of companies in these adjacencies, which again, up to, call it, 4 or 5 months ago, we weren't. So we're kind of, I guess, working, if you will, chasing stuff in kind of 2 new buckets versus, call it, 6 months ago. 
 Yes. I agree on the valuation question. We're talking about it in a review earlier this week that I guess when this happened 3 or 4 months ago, we thought valuations would be better. And I think many of them have come a lot of the way back. So we're back to the same playbook of finding synergies and finding ways that we can operate assets better than what we see as a way to be able to pay for them. So we continue to work that same angle of having a clearer way that we can improve profits to be able to pay full prices. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay, that's helpful. And the other question I wanted to ask you was on just the credit performance in the quarter, which I thought was pretty outstanding. And I just want to get your impression about expectations in terms of how you -- how we should think about that metric kind of in the back half of the year. And also sort of when do you -- this is sort of a more broader question about your sort of philosophy on credit. When do you know how to open up that kind of credit aperture again to drive growth? But what to expect? And then sort of how do you approach opening up credit again [ and ] the questions? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. That's another, I think, great question. So I'd say, if anything, maybe we kind of overreacted initially. So when this thing happened and you looked at our balance sheet and the receivables we had to collect, I think we had 20 meetings literally over the course of the month tightening terms, cutting lines, doing things which frankly did impact our revenue and growth in Q2, but it was a risk we -- I was willing to take. And so we're like along the way happy with the credit with some of the banks have turned in, the reserves they put in. And effectively, we've come in on our credit loss plan. 
 And again, just to remind people on the call, a lot of that is structural. We're charge cards. We have tons of short term, daily, a bunch in our payables businesses, credit insurance, tons of [ DDS ] in Europe. So the structure of how we collect money lends itself to kind of be able to collect it and being essential. For a lot of these field services workers, they need our product. So they basically need to pay us to kind of keep doing what they're doing. So I think we're, again, super happy with the result. 
 In terms of the second question, we're kind of forecasting it kind of as she goes. We don't see anything in the aging or in the payment behaviors that make us think things are going to get worse. So that's part 2. And then part 3 is we're testing our way into it. So now that we've seen these results and the clients are able to repay us, we've started loosening up. So for example, we really clamped down on our companion card where we open up for Beyond Fuel and saw the people that still were on that were able to pay us. And we've locked it for new accounts and now we kind of reopened it for existing accounts but not yet for new accounts. So we're effectively kind of stepping our way into -- in the looser policies and making sure that we can see repayment happening. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Best of luck, Eric. 
Eric R. Dey: Thanks, Ramsey. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra of Deutsche Bank. 
Ashish Sabadra: Eric, best wishes to you, and Charles, congrats to you. 
 Question on corporate payment. The revenue growth there was softer than what we were expecting. And I -- my guess is most of the softness was in the FX, particularly in May and June, but we see that rebound pretty well in July. I was wondering if you could just provide some color on that front. It looks like it had started to improve by the end of April and then softened in May and June. So just what happened there and how should we think about it going forward? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Ashish, it's Ron. So I'd say a few things, corporate pay in Q2. So the first one is, it's a function of our clients. So the reason, again, the business was softer was in sales, that line of business was actually 85% of plan in terms of its sales in the quarter, so we found a way to sell. There's still demand, actually quite robust demand. So it was having pockets of clients like retail clients and travel clients that were just way, way down, 70%, 80% down, and then other clients in that book that were either off or only down a little bit. So point 1, it's a function of who we had as clients because we never had a screen before of, "Hey, don't sign up corporate pay clients that don't do good when things [ are at home ]." We never knew that, that was something to be aware of. Second, I mentioned earlier, we tightened credit. And we cut lines down in that business, both in our hedging product and FX and obviously, in our core virtual card in terms of the terms that we offer to these midsized accounts. And then lastly, about 10% or 15% of our overall corporate pay business is really T&E cards, walk-around plastic, which are not all [ white collar ]. There's supplies for construction and other kinds of stuff. But that thing was just way down because travel went effectively to 0. 
 So what I'd say back is it's spotty. There are parts of it that are way down, other parts that are healthy, and we're selling a lot. The things recover. I don't know if you had a chance to look, but we put out a supplement. 
 I think, Eric, was it Page 9? 
Eric R. Dey: Page 9. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Page 9, Ashish, in there kind of shows the core virtual card thing kind of came back almost flat in July. So it's come back, really, a tremendous amount just the last 60 days. So look, our outlook on the thing is that the T&E thing will likely stay in the ditch for the rest of the year and we think the other pieces will recover. 
Ashish Sabadra: That's great. That's good color, Ron. And maybe just a follow-up question on fuel cards. So that -- the volumes have rebounded pretty well. I was just wondering if you could give some more color around if there are industries which are doing better than others. And then also, there are a few states where we've seen a resurgence of virus. Have you seen any impact in those states where there has been an -- any impact in those states? 
Eric R. Dey: Resurgence of what? Ashish, can you repeat that again? 
Ashish Sabadra: Yes. So just on the fuel cards, the volume has improved. Any color on different industries which are doing better than others? And also states where there may have been a resurgence in virus, have you seen any impact? Some of those states have -- kind of economic recovery has slowed down. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Ashish. So first of all, I think we were kind of pleased, I don't know if investors will be, that fuel cards, which are a bit of an on-the-go product, right, a mobility product, were down kind of line average, were soft at the same kind of level as the rest of the business. And I think what that points to again is that it's an essential blue collar, people try it around -- that are around people. So what we see when we look at it is a similar comment from the payables business of a huge mix. So historically, 40% or something of our fuel card clients would grow in a quarter, 20% would be down, 5%, another 20% would be down, 10% and then the remaining amount would be down something. So what we see is the whole curve has moved down. 
 Now only 20% grew in the quarter and 40% were down, up to 20%. And then 10% or 15% were down 75%. And so when we look at the clients that are at the bottom and the biggest decline, they're in just what you'd expect these kind of impacted industries, even parts of construction, where those projects fell away, where other parts of construction were still at the top. And so it's just a complete mixed bag of what the clients we have do and how much their business was impacted. 
 But the good news is we've seen the whole curve kind of move up, so not just the people down 5% or 10% getting a little bit healthier, but the people down 50% or the people down 75% all seem to be moving up over the last month. So that suggests to us the detail -- what will break is smaller. So -- that we expect, hopefully, as the plot turns, you're to get more of that business back. 
Operator: And we'll go next to Matt O'Neill with Goldman Sachs. 
Matthew O'Neill: And again, my congrats to Eric and Charles on your respective moves. 
 I was hoping I just sort of dig in a little bit and follow up on Ramsey's question around credit and also Ashish's question on the sort of end market exposure. So on credit, again, very impressive sort of stability there. To what extent do you guys track? And are you thinking about the sort of government stimulus and Payroll Protection Programs (sic) [ Paycheck Protection Program ] and the potential impact for a lagged effect on the SMBs? And maybe you could remind us the kind of relative exposure to the smaller businesses versus the larger ones as you're thinking through the recovery in the back half being sort of driven first by volume with revenue lagging to help sort of flesh that out a little bit more for us. 
Eric R. Dey: Matt, this is Eric. Yes, I mean, the good news is we're -- obviously, we're very pleased with the performance of bad debt, as Ron indicated earlier. Our agings look mostly kind of normal. And well, we do have some bad debt, that's unusual, it was mostly kind of one-off bankruptcies. As we get to the second half of the year, to answer your kind of question, our SMB portfolio is recovering a little bit slower than the enterprise volume as we've mentioned. Our SMB business as a percentage of volume is about 1/3 of our overall volume. 
 So we do expect a continued lag effect there, but we're taking a very conservative approach to that customer portfolio. We're looking at them closely. We look at the agings daily to see if there's any inherent weakness in any particular industry or category. And obviously, when we see that, we treat those customers accordingly. And again, I think the good news is it just -- we're not seeing a whole lot. And so customers are beginning to pay us. 
 From a stimulus perspective, again, I'm sure that it's helped a certain segment of customers. It's difficult for us to kind of track who's benefiting from that or not because we can't see that. But I would say we are keeping a very, very close watch on those that can be [ accounted ], particularly in certain, more impacted industries. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Matt, it's Ron. We've got a credit score with this new impacted industry overlay. So I don't know, probably 60 days ago or something, we started to layer that over. And so we're not posting yet the mission accomplished signs despite the good performance in Q2. We're keeping credit still tight, and as I mentioned earlier, testing our way into opening it up. So we do think there's some risk when the government slows the thing down. But to Eric's point, we are eyes kind of all on it and not providing particular large amounts of credit to clients that are sitting in those industries. 
Matthew O'Neill: Got it. As a follow-up, I guess, a related basis, one of the growth drivers that I think we've collectively been getting incrementally excited about recently are some of the Beyond programs, particularly on Beyond Fuel with the pandemic now. Is there a little bit of a retrenchment, a reluctance to spend incremental credit and/or is the selling process a little bit more challenged? Or because it's typically being sold into existing clients, that can continue? Just sort of thinking through the cadence of the growth from that program, particularly. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Matt, it's Ron again. It's a good question. So again, what I'd say is we took the safety route first over the growth route to make sure that we're protecting the company and the liquidity. So we did dial back credit pretty significantly, whatever, 90 days ago. And so as I mentioned, now that we've seen the repayment performance, we've opened that back up, that Beyond Fuel for existing clients. So we had kind of frozen that, at least putting new fuel card clients on that program. So whether it was a good or bad idea, we did it with our eyes wide open. So look, let's protect the liquidity of the company. Let's get careful, and we can spring back into action in different days. So we're getting comfortable that we've seen some number of cycles now, and again, are starting to loosen things up. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Trevor Williams of Jefferies. 
Trevor Williams: Eric, congrats on a great run. 
 On expenses, Ron, your comment about being down 10% year-over-year for the full year. First, I just want to make sure that I caught that correctly. And then any framework for how much of the decline in that is in variable versus fixed costs coming out that could end up being more permanent? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. So on the first part, you got it right. Against the prior year, expenses were, for Q2, I think, down -- Eric, 11? And I think, Trevor, I said that kind of our forecast, we're kind of planning a down 10%, high single digits kind of 8% to 10% for Q3 and Q4. And on that, what you said, some fair amount of it is variable. Obviously, with volume and revenue lower, you get money back. Sales commissions, you get money back. And then selectively, we slowed some projects that depend on outside parties, third parties that are distracted, doing other things. So it slowed some things where I didn't think we'd get the same kind of traction on them. And I guess we do get some help from FX. We got -- we had a bit of a headwind on the revenue side but clearly helping us on the expense side. But we haven't -- I think I said this before. We're trying to play the long game. So we're not carving lots of money out of client service or out of core tech or out of core sales. We're trying to protect those sets of capabilities for a different day. 
Trevor Williams: Okay, got it. That all makes sense. And then just my follow-up on corporate payments. So I think you're lapping a big Cambridge quarter from the third quarter last year. So just as we look at the supplement and the line that you've got on FX revenue, you had a big month-over-month acceleration from June to July. So I'm just wondering if we could even read into that as being better, if not for the tougher comp or if that number is actually just capturing the FX portion of Cambridge and not the entire piece with the cross-border element, too. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I think some of it is the comps or the difficult comps, but I think also some of it is people are a bit frozen when you have volatility and currencies, which we had kind of at the beginning of the quarter. The end of the first quarter, people act, and then I think they froze a bit wondering how things are going to move. So I think [ it froze a bit of the ] hedging product, which carries high margins. And then second, don't miss my credit comment. We did the same thing there in some of those products, where there's volatility and contracts to move out of the money. We -- I dialed those things back so we trimmed lines, which moves some of the share. We split share in that business across some clients. 
 So again, I want to make sure everybody hears that there's clearly a pretty high [ R-squared ] between credit openness and growth even of existing clients. And we were, again, quite cautious at the beginning. And now that we've seen kind of that good report, I want everybody to hear me that we're starting to loosen. We're not going completely crazy back to where we are, but we're going to help enable basically the businesses to grab some of that share back. 
Operator: And we'll go next to Bob Napoli of William Blair. 
Robert Napoli: Eric, it's been great, wish you the best. 
 On the corporate, where -- okay. So your balance sheet's in great shape, [ during a ] lot of interesting businesses. You've tightened credit. You're starting to loosen up. Where can we -- where can you go on offense and invest more? And the -- and I guess it's on the M&A side, but around corporate payments, virtual cards, organically expanding, I shouldn't -- isn't this a good time to be putting more money on offense, understanding so earnings will be lower in the back half of the year? But you want to come out of this -- this will be behind us in, what, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months. But where can you go on offense? Do you come out of this in… 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Bob, it's Ron. It's a good question. I think the answer is the full AP product line as we bought that business a year ago, and it is -- I mean, it's just blockbuster in front of me. It's up some crazy amount since we've owned it and up even a crazy amount in Q2. But more importantly, and in front of me, I think the sales were in the quarter -- in a quarter where we sold half, those sales were 50% or something above plan. So the demand, to your point, in the marketplace to be able to remotely pay bills, I don't know if it's going to stay at an all-time high, but it's certainly top of mind for people now sitting at their houses. 
 So to your point, we're clearly going to spend more money on marketing and sales there and shift more energy. So for example, we used to sell virtual cards and then -- and also T&E cards to that same account, so we had some T&E cards in our portfolio. Well, we've kind of reoriented those people to pitch virtual card and then maybe -- oh, by the way, virtual card and full AP, but not T&E card. So we'll, for sure, step up the marketing and sales pressure against that line of business. 
 And then second, clearly, on the transaction side. We certainly know all the assets in the space and we like the category. And I'm comfortable -- we're comfortable that we have money now. We've got, you said, $1.9 billion. And it's building, right? We generated cash flow. And I'm not so worried about the receivables and leverage is about 2.5x. So we're sitting in a place, and some of our pals that compete are not sitting as good a place, Bob. So I'd say we like where we are in terms of the pipeline there as well. So more marketing money and maybe use the balance sheet. 
Robert Napoli: Okay. And then -- I mean adjacencies, are there going to be adjacencies to corporate payments? Is that really where the focus is? Or are there other portions of the bigger sectors that you're looking at adjacencies? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. We're looking at all, right? We started this thing, as I mentioned, back kind of in the fall or winter last year, looking at our 4 big businesses and this whole construct of adjacency to particularly software adjacencies, their health with the clients. And so we've identified, as I mentioned to Tien-Tsin earlier, adjacencies both in payables, around invoicing, for example, and our other business as well. In lodging, we've got some adjacencies and, as I mentioned, in fuel card. 
 So I'm saying it so that people aren't surprised if you see us transact in something that is not exactly in the 4 but obviously, super adjacent or tied to the 4 businesses we're in. But yes, we still like the other categories. I know you, someone who follows payables, likes it and we like it. But we like -- we really do like our other product lines quite a bit, too. If you look at [ our money, our non -- 2 lines ] have grown low mid-teens for years now, Bob. So we're happy with some of the other businesses, too. 
Operator: And we'll go next to George Mihalos of Cowen. 
Georgios Mihalos: Eric, my congrats and best wishes as well. 
 Ron, just wanted to follow up on the expense question, kind of the 8% to 10% OpEx reduction that you're thinking of for third and fourth quarter. I think last quarter, you were kind of thinking in the 5% range and then it's going to be more variable. I'm just curious, that 8% to 10%, is there a way to think of a portion of that, that may be permanently removed beyond what you're thinking for the back half of 2020? 
Eric R. Dey: George, it's Eric. Yes. I mean I really wouldn't look at it that way. It's certainly not what we want to do long term. I mean we want to grow the business, so we want to invest in the business. I mean, certainly, over the short term, we are looking at ways to rightsize the business so we can maximize profitability over the short term. But we're also looking at ways to reinvest in the business so we can reaccelerate growth when we come out of this environment that we're in. So I would say over the medium term, short -- in the short term, I would say, "Hey, we're going to have some cost savings over the medium term. We're going to reinvest back in the business and probably get around back to where we kind of were from a margin standpoint." 
Georgios Mihalos: Okay. That's helpful. And just a quick follow-up. Within the tolls business, I know the last couple of quarters, I think, sort of the tail end of last year, there were some free tags and some promotional activity that was in there. Did that have an impact on the tolls business at all in 2Q? And how are you thinking about those promotions on a go-forward basis? 
Eric R. Dey: [ We need to do toll business within tech companies. The promotions, other people's promotions ]. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Oh, are you asking about the -- promoting to sell new tags? 
Georgios Mihalos: Yes, just basically some discounting as it relates to the toll business. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. So it's Ron. So yes, the short answer is when some of the competitors came into the toll business, [ we -- the time for our business is the gorilla ] is the -- it's the top of the line and has the most coverage, the best systems, the biggest network. So it was very hard for newbies with [ premier stuff ], in my opinion, to sell, so they went to price. And so we decided to match some of their kind of free-starting things to make sure that we kept a dominant share of the new business. So that's worked pretty well. We started to -- kind of at the end of the year and roll through 3 and 6 months kind of promotions. 
 We tested some other ways of signing people up, for example, "Hey, if you use the thing, you pay the monthly fee. And if you don't, [ we know ]." So we've gotten creative. And so we're still selling a lot. The sales are still quite good in that business. And more importantly, the promotional stuff is converting into pay, which we studied quite a lot to the people that come on a free pass, actually convert to paying, and they do. So I'd say the approach, so far, so good. 
Operator: All right. And we'll go next to Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Congrats to Eric and Charles as well from my side. 
 Going back to the M&A question, I'm sorry, Ron. But when we think about valuation and adjacent areas, should we think about the IRRs being comparable to some of the deals that you've done in the past? Or will the complexion look different because they are different types of businesses and the valuation backdrop is different? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. So that's a super good question. I think the answer is it depends. I mean I'd say if the transaction is of any meaningful size, uses any meaningful amount of capital, we have to see our way to returns. So we look at returns the way you guys do money now and what we get back. And again, from that perspective, we study our thesis of things that we can do that can create better returns there. 
 But I'd say in some of the smaller ones, we look at other effects like the ability to sell, for example. So if we added an adjacency in payables that help clients in the front end, do we hear back and do we see in the sales results better win rates in the pipeline because our package is a bit more complete? Do we see that in the feedback and the RFPs? And so I'd say to you, if it's a smaller kind of transactions, we would look at factors other than just the profit returns. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Okay. And I guess following up on some of the questions, again, on the last -- sort of the SMB versus enterprise mix and its impact on revenues. Eric, is there a way to think through the actual quantification of the drag as we think about the second half? I mean is there any way to dimensionalize that as we think about the recovery and the actual impact? I'm just trying to make sure I understand that part. 
Eric R. Dey: Yes, there's really a couple of business where we're seeing a little bit of a drag. That's obviously fuel that we called out earlier. A good percentage of our business there is SMB, and we're seeing a little bit on the lodging side as well. Actually, we got some very large enterprise accounts in that business. That's how that business was built. And we've got more down market over the years. So those -- again, those accounts as well are seeing a little bit of lag in terms of how it's coming back. 
 In terms of quantifying it, I think we'd have to go back and actually try to put pencil to paper to come up with a better estimate. I wouldn't want to just throw something out over the phone. So if you want to get back to us, I think we may be able to come up with something. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Congrats again. 
Operator: And our final question will come from John Coffey with Susquehanna. 
John Coffey: My question for you is on the corporate payments segment. And I guess I was wondering -- I was looking at Slide 19 (sic) [ Slide 9 ], and I see that you have those 4 sublines: virtual card, T&E, full AP and FX. I was wondering if one were to look at the April, May and June months, and then you compare that to the 17% revenue decline, what would you be able -- what would you look at to say like, "Okay, I see these figures on Slide 9 and that makes sense when I see the decline of 17%"? Is really looking at virtual card the best way to figure out which way the wind is blowing because, clearly, full AP was up a lot. So I'm just trying to -- maybe the better way to say this, help understand the revenue contribution of each of those sublines a little bit better. 
Eric R. Dey: That's just the revenue contribution, it'd be just these 4 top lines. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. We probably wouldn't share that other than I will make the point, which I think we did on Page 9 that if you look at the T&E card, along with a couple of other things, we called about the Brazil benefits and the airline thing, but collectively, those things are less than 4% or 5% of our revenue in July. So the headline is the T&E thing was not a super big part of the corporate payments business overall. And as you can see, it's down 40% volume, 50%, I think I told you, in revenue. And so it's not what's going to make the thing go. We think that thing's going to kind of sit where it's at. And that the growth -- the way to look at the thing is the delta between the virtual card performance, corporate pay performance and revenue in Q2 being down mid-teens and then seeing the virtual card volume recover in July, almost to flat. And so the corporate pay business is going to go as virtual card and FX goes because full AP is rocking and we're going to spend more money on it. The T&E thing will trade flat. So the recovery in virtual cards and clients getting comfortable again to make trades and FX, those will determine the pace of growth in the second half. 
Operator: And we have reached the end of our allotted time, so this will conclude today's conference. We appreciate everyone's participation, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-07 17:30:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the FLEETCOR Technologies First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jim Eglseder, Head of Investor Relations for FLEETCOR Technologies. Thank you. You may begin. 
James Eglseder: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our first quarter 2020 earnings call. With me today are Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO; and Eric Dey, our CFO. 
 Following comments from both Ron and Eric, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for Q&A session. It is only then that the queue will open for questions. Please note, our earnings release and supplement can be found under the Investor Relations section of our website, fleetcor.com.  
 Throughout this call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than non-GAAP information at other companies. Reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appear in today's press release and on our website as previously described.  
 Now before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everybody that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements. This includes forward-looking statements about new products and fee initiatives and expectations regarding business development and acquisitions. They are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore, you should not put undue reliance upon them. These results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K and on our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available on our website and at www.sec.gov. 
 With that out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our first quarter earnings call. I plan to cover 4 subjects at the opening here: first, I'll comment on COVID and our response to the crisis; second, I'll share my perspective on Q1 results; third, I'll speak to the trends that we're seeing in our businesses in April; and lastly, I'll cover our framework for resetting priorities in the company.  
 Okay. Let me begin with some remarks about the COVID situation and what we're doing in response. So like many companies, we've taken a number of actions over the last couple of months. Safety. So, first, to ensure the safety of our 8,000-plus worldwide employees, we quickly transitioned the majority of our employees to work from home. I'd say that we're working our way through the new work-from-home model, trying to establish a new cadence for running the company, more teleconferences, more Zoom, more general employee communications, really relooking at people's priorities.
 Second thing, we focused on business continuity to assure our systems and payment products continue to work through this period. I'm pleased to report that in Q1, we delivered the highest system uptime and fewest client incidents in quite some time. So good news there. 
 Third, we focused on and shored up our liquidity. We consolidated cash. We raised a bridge loan and we've taken our liquidity to about $1.5 billion. 
 And lastly, credit. We've tightened credit lines and payment terms. We've shut down inactive lines, reduced unused line capacity, selectively reduced payment terms for distressed clients or industries, and we've repurposed staff to step up our collections intensity. 
 So in this initial response phase, we've had some success managing the situation and learning how to operate within it.  
 Okay. Let me shift gears and talk a bit about our Q1 results. So we reported Q1 revenue of $661 million, up 6%, and cash EPS of $3, up 12%. Our Q1 revenue finished about $10 million lower than our expectations as our businesses began to contract in the second half of March when the shelter-in-place orders took effect. January revenue grew 8%, February revenue, 8%, and our March revenue, 3%, leading to overall print revenue growth of 6% for the quarter. 
 In terms of organic revenue growth or what we call like-for-like revenue growth, Q1 finished at 5% overall. Inside of that, fuel coming in at 2%; corporate pay, quite good at 20%; toll at 10%; and lodging at 5%. All of our businesses were impacted by the sudden volume declines in late March, bringing our growth rates for the quarter below target.  
 Despite the softer -- slightly softer revenue in the quarter, our profits actually came in at the high end of our expectations, helped there by a lower tax rate and fewer outstanding shares. 
 Our operating trends in Q1 also affected by COVID. Our same-store sales declined 2%, again related predominantly to the late March softening. Our new sales grew 2% versus last year. Again, the market began to get distracted in late March. But thankfully, our client retention remains stable at 91%. So look, given everything, a pretty good financial print for Q1. A good start in January and February helped us hold on to the Q1 performance.  
 Okay. Let me make a turn to the trends we're seeing in April and run through each of our businesses and the COVID impact on each. So first up is fuel. So here in North America, our fuel volumes are 20% to 25% behind last year in April. Our trucking business holding up a bit better than our local. Because many of our North America fuel businesses are essential services, it looks like our volume declines are leveling off. Our North America fuel revenue will be helped quite a bit by spreads in April as the fuel margins remain very wide.  
 In our international fuel card business, volume, weaker than it is here. Business is down 25% to 50% depending on the particular market, mostly because the Europe shutdown was earlier than here in the U.S., and also because in the U.K., in particular, there's a greater proportion of white-collar cardholders who have been more impacted by shelter-in-place orders. Generally, we expect both North America and international fuel revenue in April to be a bit better than the volumes, and that's because fuel revenues or fees, some of them are fixed in nature, think card fees, which tends to have revenue be a bit better than volume.  
 Okay, next up, corporate pay. So in corporate pay, our virtual card volumes off about 20% in April versus prior year. Again, we're expecting probably volumes to level off there as lots of our client AP is fixed. Some good news with our full service, full AP automation and outsourcing business, which we expect to be up in April. The remote capability, the ability to process AP outside of the office, it's resonating. And our cross-border business continuing to hold up and grow a bit in April, mostly due to the ongoing currency volatility. We did take a extraordinary loss -- credit loss in the cross-border business, which Eric will cover in some detail in his remarks.  
 Turning to our lodging business. We expect our core workforce business to be down about 25% versus prior year in April. Our rail, truckers, construction workers continue to need rooms even in this environment. And just as a reminder, most of our workforce lodging travelers drive to their hotels. They don't fly to their hotels. Our new Travelliance airline or crew lodging business will be way down in April, somewhere in the 75%-plus range, as airlines canceled most of their flights, fortunately, a much, much smaller part of our lodging business.  
 Brazil. Brazil toll, a bright spot for us. So despite toll transactions being down in April, we expect toll revenue to be roughly flat or even slightly up, and that's primarily because toll revenues are subscription-based. Lastly, our gift card business expected to be down about 50% in April as many of our brick-and-mortar retail clients are temporarily closed, moving much of the activity in that business to digital redemption.  
 So a few conclusions here. Our April volume and revenue impacts vary quite a bit by business. So some of our business not impacted much, some impacted in the down 25% range and some impacted down to the 50% or 50%-plus range. Fortunately, the businesses most affected, most impacted by COVID represent a smaller proportion of our overall business. 
 We do expect April revenue to come in 20% to 25% behind the prior year. We do expect volumes to begin to flatten. We see it sequentially as we look through April. And because many of our cardholders are essential workers, first responders, health care workers, truckers, rail, construction, they keep right on doing what they do. Also important, most of our volume decline thus far is client softness, not client loss. So good news that it could come back on the other side. And lastly, we're a 50% EBITDA business so we can continue to make money and generate cash even at these distressed levels of volume.  
 Okay, let me transition over now to the company's priorities and how we're framing things. So we've basically looked at a reset here of priorities based on the changing environment. So Phase 1, the response phase, which I outlined earlier. We've taken, again, 4 actions already: safety, business continuity, liquidity and credit initially here to respond to the situation. And again, I think we've had decent success and report we're well underway here.  
 Phase 2, the shutdown phase, the place we're at now, where volumes are down and all of us are learning new behaviors. The priorities in this phase are expenses. So we're working to get our expenses down and better aligned to current volumes. We're cutting where we can, where it makes sense, but protecting, particularly the selling system and technology capabilities that we'll need when we come out the other side. 
 Selling, we're changing -- modifying how we sell, targeting different prospects, surge industries, moving almost exclusively to digital contact, repositioning our message. So lots of work to progress selling.  
 Projects. We're reevaluating our project work, pushing projects that we can control and it makes sense while delaying other projects that rely on others to a different day.
 And then lastly, we look forward to a future to a phase where businesses begin to reopen and things begin to recover. So message here is we'll be ready. In that phase, the recovery phase, we'll plan to chase acquisitions that maybe, just maybe weren't there before. We also may get some benefit from COVID's new behaviors that we can take advantage of on the other side. So for example, the emphasis on touchless transactions, think electronic tolls versus cash, think distressed passenger mobile applications versus visiting gate agents, think payroll cards versus paper payroll checks. And then even remote working, think about our AP automation and outsourcing service to pay bills when you're outside of the office. So the hope is that we may be better positioned in some of our businesses when we get to the recovery side.  
 So look, in closing, we've never been in a place like this before. We're continuing to operate the business and to serve our essential clients, many of which continue to work through the crisis. We're in process of replanning things, our priorities, our expense levels, our project plans, our sales and go-to-market approaches, in an effort to make the best of the situation. And like you, we're hopeful that the gradual reopening will bring our clients back, and that our business will return to at least some sense of normal as we progress through the year. But I can tell you, we will be ready. So with that, let me turn the call back over to Eric to provide some additional details on the quarter. Eric? 
Eric R. Dey: Thank you, Ron. I'll be going through my regular remarks for the first quarter results as quickly as I can to allow for some additional discussion about the second quarter expectations and your Q&A. 
 For the first quarter of 2020, we reported revenue of $661.1 million, up 6% compared to $621.8 million in the first quarter of 2019. GAAP net income decreased 15% to $147.1 million from $172.1 million. And GAAP net income per diluted share decreased 14% to $1.67 from $1.93 in the first quarter of 2019.  
 Included in the first quarter 2020 results was the impact of a $90.1 million or $0.74 per diluted share onetime loss related to a customer receivable in our foreign currency trading business. Due to the extraordinary impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our Cambridge business experienced a very large one-off bad debt loss in the first quarter, resulting from a large client in the agricultural commodity space entering voluntary liquidation. The details are in the earnings supplement so I won't go through all of them again here.  
 I'd remind you that approximately 30% of our Cambridge revenue comes from hedging, whereas approximately 70% comes from making international payments. I'd also note that Cambridge does not take FX risk. Our books and/or position are covered by back-to-back offsetting transactions with banks. This is a credit loss due to a customer's bankruptcy and inability to cover their AP margin calls. While we do believe there is a chance of some recovery through the liquidation process, we have determined it appropriate to take a provision for the full bad debt loss of $90 million on the customer due to uncertainty of any future recovery. We view this as truly a one-off event as this business has experienced less than 1.5% bad debt loss as a percentage of revenue for as far back as we have data, including periods prior to our acquisition of Cambridge in the third quarter of 2017. Please see our earnings supplement for a detailed overview of this onetime loss.  
 Also included in the first quarter of 2019 was the impact of a $15.7 million or $0.17 per diluted share impairment charge related to our minority investment in a telematics business. Excluding the impact of the onetime customer loss and impairment charge, net income increased 13%, and net income per diluted share increased 15% in the first quarter of 2020 versus the first quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP financial metrics that we will be discussing, our adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share, and the reconciliation to GAAP numbers, is provided in Exhibit 1 of our press release. Adjusted net income for the first quarter of 2020 increased 11% to $264.5 million compared to $238.4 million in the same period last year. And adjusted net income per diluted share increased 12% to $3 compared to $2.67 in adjusted net income per diluted share in the first quarter of 2019. 
 First quarter of 2020 results reflect a negative year-over-year impact from the macroeconomic environment of approximately $6 million in revenue. The negative macro was driven mostly by lower foreign exchange rates, specifically the Brazilian real and U.K. pound, when compared with the first quarter of 2019. We believe FX negatively impacted revenue by approximately $21 million. Fuel prices were down slightly year-over-year for the full quarter. And although we cannot precisely calculate the impact of these changes, we believe it was mostly neutral to the quarter. And finally, fuel spreads had about a $15 million favorable impact in the quarter.  
 Now moving down the income statement. Excluding the impact of the onetime loss in our foreign currency trading business, total operating expenses were up 10% for the first quarter of 2020 to $370.1 million compared with $337.6 million in the first quarter of 2019. The increase was primarily due to acquisitions and bad debt expense. As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses, excluding the onetime loss, were approximately 56% compared to 54.3% in the first quarter of 2019. Excluding the impact of a onetime customer loss, bad debt expense in the first quarter of 2020 was $27.7 million or 9 basis points compared to $22.2 million or 8 basis points in the first quarter of 2019. Included in the first quarter was a reserve of $10 million associated with expected additional credit losses around the world due to the impact of COVID-19. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 4% to $64.5 million in the first quarter of 2020 from $67.4 million in the first quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange rates. Interest expense decreased 9% to $35.7 million compared to $39.1 million in the first quarter of 2019. The decrease in interest expense was due primarily to decreases in LIBOR related to the unhedged portion of our debt, partially offset by the impact of additional borrowing for share buybacks.  
 Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2020 was 14.6% compared to 24.9% for the first quarter of 2019. Excluding the onetime customer loss and the impact of the impairment charge in the first quarter of 2019, our effective tax rate was 18.9% for the first quarter of 2020 compared to 23.3% in the first quarter of 2019. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due primarily to additional compensation expense booked for tax purposes on stock option exercises.  
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1,552,000,000 in total cash. Approximately $482 million is restricted and consists primarily of customer deposits. We also have approximately $352 million of undrawn availability on our revolver, and closed on a $250 million bridge loan in April in order to maximize the company's liquidity. So in total, we believe we have adequate liquidity to weather the COVID storm.  
 As of March 31, 2020, we had $4,323,000,000 outstanding on our credit facilities and $819 million borrowed in our securitization facility. We purchased approximately 2 million shares in the first quarter for $530 million at an average price of $263. We have approximately $326 million in repurchase capacity remaining under our current authorization. 
 As of March 31, 2020, our leverage ratio was 2.75x EBITDA, which is well below our covenant level of 4x EBITDA as calculated under our credit agreement. Finally, we spent approximately $18 million on CapEx during the first quarter of 2020.  
 Now turning to the outlook for the second quarter and balance of the year. First, I want to remind everyone that although our businesses are very resilient, our businesses have all been impacted by COVID-19, some more than others. As a reminder, our business models are primarily recurring revenue in nature. We have a very broad customer base and diversified businesses across industries and geographies.  
 Second, we are suspending our full year guidance. There is simply too much uncertainty regarding the resumption of business activity around the world to accurately predict our volumes could be in the second quarter and rest of the year. 
 Some revenue trending data for the first quarter in April are as follows. Revenues in January and February were tracking at or ahead of our expectations before the impact of COVID-19 in March. Through the first 2 months of the year, revenue was approximately 8% and 8% ahead of prior year, respectively. In March, our volumes were impacted mid-month. And as a result, March revenue was only up approximately 3% versus prior year. And for the quarter, revenue was 6% ahead of prior year.  
 Our expectations are for volumes to hit their respective floors in April and begin to recover gradually as the world starts to reopen. April revenue is expected to be down approximately 20% versus prior year. We expect that the second quarter will be the lowest in terms of volume and revenue. And as the economy starts to recover, volumes should build throughout the year, resulting in higher revenue and earnings per share in the third and fourth quarters. 
 With that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll now take a question from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: I'll start by just asking on the expense outlook here and what you can control. What are you thinking about levers on the cost side that you might do here to protect the bottom line from some of the macro pressures you called out? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Tien-Tsin, it's Ron. I'd say we're probably a target of about 5%. And it would be on volume-related things, things that flex versus selling system or tech things. We'll probably also clip the capital plan a bit. But in our business, you can't save your way to profitability, our profits turn on revenues, and so we're going to be quite careful to not over-dial that. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Yes. No, I expect that. And then you mentioned M&A. With the world changing, valuations maybe opens up the opportunity set a little bit, just your appetite, Ron, to do deals here. Are we in a wait and see mode? Or are you willing to pull the trigger on some deals? 
Ronald F. Clarke: I'm telling you, Tien-Tsin, I say never. We think -- I think this is a game-changer. You've heard our complaints ongoing the last few years about people in the space driving up prices and seller expectations and free money and stuff. I think lots of companies are hurt. Companies that have assets we're interested in are hurt. I think there'll be some impact obviously to valuations. I think people that compete with us for deals will have more thoughts on the credit side. So I'd say to you, probably it's high, that's a really long time, and we're spending lots of time, what I'll call kind of new deal thinking. There's 5 or 6 assets that we've coveted for some period of time that I personally think may have some chance of opening. So I would say high. 
Operator: We'll now take our next question from Ryan Cary with Bank of America. 
Ryan Cary: Just following up a little bit on Tien-Tsin's question. It sounds like most your cost saves are more on the volume variable side rather than the investment side. So are you still planning on the step-up in sales and IT expenses you discussed last quarter? And I think you called out expectations from incremental IT spend in the $200-plus million-ish range in 2020. Is that still on track? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Ryan, it's Ron. So that's right. We built sales plans to try to grow sales production, call it, circa 15%. We kind of grow sales expense, a little slower, call it, 10%, 12%. So yes, we built the plan to do that. Some of it takes care of itself, right? If people don't reach the production goals, you get some of that money back in the form of lower commissions. I'd also say we pulled back on some kinds of marketing and lead gen, obviously, all the physical trade shows and stuff like that. But with that said, I think we're being super cautious on the headcount side. It takes a long time to build a really good field group and a really good telesales group. And so I think we're quite reluctant to reduce that and honestly, not to even kind of refill or replace as we move through the year. So we're clearly trying to play the long game on selling. 
Ryan Cary: Got it. And can you talk about some of the trends you saw in the toll business in the quarter? I was a little surprised the organic growth slowed to 10%.  Was there anything particular worth calling out? And anything you can say about growth of new urban toll users in the quarter? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. So first of all, I'd call it -- it's a really good result in this second half of March to still pencil that thing out of 10%. We're quite happy with it. But the reason it's not close to the mid-teens would be a couple of things. First, the transactions did soften and we did get paid a bit on spend, particularly on the B2B side there. So the COVID clipped a couple of points at the end. And then the other thing is the guy that leads that, they pushed to offer some free tags to build our tag volume at the end of the year to compete with the banks. And so we have -- we'll be rolling off kind of in the next month or 2. We probably have another couple of percent of what I'll call free tags sitting in our Q1 results. So those would be kind of the 2 nicks on the number. 
Ryan Cary: And anything you can say about the growth of new urban tolls in the quarter or just trends that you're seeing? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Can you say -- you broke up a bit, Ryan? 
Ryan Cary: I apologize. Just anything around the new urban tag toll users in the quarter or any metrics around usage there. 
Eric R. Dey: In terms of urban tag sales usage? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Urban tags. Yes. I don't have that handy. I mean it's down. I think we targeted some kind of number, call it, 40,000 to 50,000 a quarter. I'll have to get back to you, I don't have any handy. 
Operator: We'll now take our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Appreciate all the disclosures, and I'm glad you guys are well. I guess the first question is on the comments on the second quarter being the weakest. Ron, you mentioned you have some defensive mix of businesses inside of your business. Can you just talk about how much of the volume is from these defensive areas versus the more cyclical stuff? And what gives you the confidence that we're going to inflect in the second quarter? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean I think the confidence comes from the sequential analysis, right? So we have a bit more texture than we set out. We've got daily reports. And I think from what we put in the supplement, it appears to us that virtually all of our businesses are planing, bottoming, if you will, at this point. And we've got another week, I think, of learning. We just had a big review yesterday. So I think -- what you guys haven't seen. So I'd say, if anything, we're starting actually to see a few of the business tick up a tiny bit. So the comment is our best guess is we're bottoming. And that we, Eric and I, think probably that May and June, it will be a smidge better than what we said in April. I quoted April around 20%-ish off of the prior year. So if, in fact, the tickup is happening, then clearly, Q3, if the world reopens, will be better. So our best guess is Q2 will be the worst. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Okay. And you also mentioned, Ron, like that the health of the portfolio is pretty strong given the defensive mix. Can you just talk about how do you feel about the general health? I mean do you feel that certain areas of your portfolio might be at risk if there's a prolonged economic downturn? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean I think we tried, Sanjay, with that chart to get into the haves and the have-nots. So I think like every business that you guys follow, some are affected none, some and a lot. And I think that's the same thing inside the FLEETCOR portfolio. And so we have businesses on that page that we think are the weakest and probably would have the longest trough. So for example, and again that page in front is what we called out our... 
Eric R. Dey: It's Page 10, Sanjay, in the earnings supplement. 
Ronald F. Clarke: So the couple -- look, the couple, Sanjay, that would be, I think, the softest, the longest would be the recent lodging airline acquisition we did that fundamentally relies on the planes flying and crew flying. So that thing's off, I don't know, 75% and it would be off for a while. And then the gift card business, to the extent that brick-and-mortar retail stays closed or some of those go BK, some of those go out of business, I'd say those couple of businesses, I think, will be weakest. But the other ones, I think if we've got one message today, again is, the impact is softness. So it's a fuel card client with 10 drivers driving 2/3 of what they used to drive versus he's fired 3 or 4 of those captains. So the ability for the thing to kind of come back, if the clients kind of come back, we come back. And so I'd say the rest of the businesses, obviously, we've got a few that are in the green, that are kind of happy days. And then we've got the rest that are kind of sitting there waiting for the clients to get healthy again. So I think other than a couple that I call out, that I'd say have a longer curve to kind of come back, the couple I called out, I think the rest should be on their way back because of the essential service nature of our workforce. 
Operator: We'll now take our next question from Trevor Williams with Jefferies. 
Trevor Williams: On corporate payments, I wanted to ask a few more on the sales side that Ron, you alluded to in your prepared remarks. Just with most people working remotely now, I'm wondering how that's impacted the selling process in that business. Because my assumption, and please correct me if I'm wrong, is that these are fairly long sales cycles and implementation periods. So as we think about you guys prebooking a lot of next year's revenue growth in the prior year, just how much of that we should be expecting to come from new customers signed in 2020? Just -- and what the progress looks like there. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Trevor. You're totally right on current year. I think we've called out before that in the corporate pay business, particularly in the core virtual card business, most of the revenue from new accounts is sold the prior year, call it, somewhere 80% to 90%. So the revenue in 2020 is driven off of sales contracted but not implemented from '19.
 So on your second question, I'd say we're still finding our way, right? So this thing surprised all of us in March. We have a marketing and sales plan and closing plan, and it got changed, right? You can't have trade shows and we're not visiting large accounts like we used to. So I'd say there's been a repositioning of how to sell, what marketing to do, how to contact people. And I'd say, if anything, the receptivity seems high, like people have taken the call, taken the appointments. What I think is still unclear is can we close, right? We'll call it 30 days into this and some of these people have more time on their hands or they're just being kinder in these times, but the contact rates are kind of okay. So I'd say probably in 60 days, we'll have a fix on whether sales can kind of be where we thought, just done in a different way, or whether sales are going to be softer. I'd say we just don't know yet. 
Trevor Williams: Okay. No, that's really helpful. And then just on credit, Eric, I appreciate your comments in your prepared remarks. But was just hoping to get some more color on how credits trended in April maybe month-to-date. Whether that's either delinquencies or actual losses starting to come through more in earnest, just as we think about where we may need to expect losses to flex up to as we work through the trough in Q2? And then just wondering if you've seen any change in payment patterns after the PPP loans hit, and especially with some of the smaller fleet customers? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Trevor, it's Ron. Let me take the first part and then I'll let Eric comment on the second part. I would say it's the most surprising thing to us so far, and surprising in a good way. So when this thing hit, you can imagine, we did student body, right, to work on credit and liquidity collections. And so we've got a monitoring system that looks at trip worthy, how rates people going delinquent, and then roll rates aging. And so I'd say that it's up, so we have benchmarked in all of our businesses. I'd say it's up but it's not up in any kind of meaningful way. So too early to call that, "Hey, we've gotten through this between the stimulus money and stock. Hey, we're going to kind of be okay." But if you said to me now, how did it look, say, this Phoenix thing, it looks pretty good. 
 And the last point on it is, we actually get a benefit from the lower volumes and the lower fuel prices. The fact that spend, and effectively AR -- new AR balances are dropping, obviously, it makes the collection assignment smaller and the credit risk smaller. So I'd say on this, this one, say, on the Phoenix thing, so far, so good. 
Eric R. Dey: Yes. And Trevor, just to add to that, this is Eric. Obviously, we're -- we take a look at the aging very closely and we track it week-to-week. Obviously, exactly what the progress is in some of these aging buckets. And Ron indicated, we have been surprised that it really hasn't changed a whole lot. We've seen a little bit of tick up in some of the aging buckets, particularly in the fuel category in the U.S., particularly in the SMB category, so it's a little worse. And we've seen a little bit of tick up in Brazil as well, kind of a little worse. But again, nothing dramatic, nothing kind of to the magnitude that we thought it was going to be. 
 We look at our AR balances a lot. I mean if you look at our AR balance at the end of the year, we had about $2.6 billion in AR, which moved to about 2 points -- I don't know, $2.1 billion, kind of at the end of March. And then at the end of April, we're down to about $1.8 billion. So the risk profile of the remaining AR is also getting better just because of the sheer amount of the outstanding AR that we have. So all in all, I think we're in pretty good shape. I think we were pretty conservative to take a bit of the reserve that we did at the end of the first quarter and we're keeping a close eye on it. And we've changed a lot of practices, and we do some things -- done some things to collect some of our money sooner. So I think we're off to an okay place. 
Ronald F. Clarke: And let me just add, Trevor, one thing. We don't compete on terms like we compete with banks and other people. So we had policies for a long time in this company to compete on products and on the tech and on the convenience of the product. And so we have tons of daily, daily, tons of short terms weekly. In Europe, we have half of our book, I think, is insured. So we carve through, we have tons internationally on direct debit collect where we basically pull the money. And so in those cases, you've got trip rates in the 2% range, very, very small kinds of delinquency. So when we studied our old book again intently a month ago when this started, I think we feel pretty good structurally of how we've got the thing set up. 
Operator: We'll now take our next question from Steven Wald with Morgan Stanley. 
Steven Wald: Maybe just on a high level, starting with corporate payments. Ron, you talked about never been higher in terms of watching for opportunities in the M&A side here. But if we start in corporate payments, and maybe you could expand this out to some of the other areas. Could you maybe talk about as you're looking at opportunities or as you're looking at your own offering today and watching the experience of this downturn and disruptions and what you can solve for, what sort of changed, or if it has changed at all, in terms of where you want to be in the landscape of the corporate payment's B2B opportunity since we caught up 3 months ago? And maybe if you could expand it out to the other areas. Are there any areas that you serve across your offerings that you maybe feel less inclined to be in actively or expanding? 
Ronald F. Clarke: No. It's a good question. I mean in the context of COVID and sheltering and the trends that we might expect over the next year or 2, this payables or corporate payments business, it's a great place. And the reason is that lots of AP, lots of the spend is fixed, think leases or IT contracts and stuff. And so bills have to get paid or services get turned off. And so I'd say, if anything, we'd like this corporate pay business for 5 years, and we've built a bunch of stuff and added to it and invested it. I'd say if anything, we like it even more. I think it's probably a little bit more defensive going forward versus the kind of the mobility stuff. Maybe mobility stays depressed a bit, whereas kind of AP stays where it is. So I'd say, if anything, it probably elevates that segment even a notch higher for us. 
Steven Wald: Understood. Maybe just in terms of a quick follow-up; I was looking to your slide, I think Slide 8, you had talked about the corporate payments growth bouncing back to 20%. But I think you also disclosed that you pulled the payroll card segment out of there, and that was the area that you called out last quarter with a sort of trouble from the prior -- from last year's disruption to services. What was the growth looking like ex those adjustments? I don't know if you restated that in the prior quarters or not. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Eric, do you know? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes. I'm looking for that. I don't know if we did a schedule on it. Yes. I know, Trevor, again, is the payroll card business was in the circa 30% down in volume for April. So if you stuck it on that chart to track the rest of the business, it would have brought it down some. And I think the 20% number is a revenue number. I don't have the payroll card revenue. But my guess, it's probably off in the 30% range. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Steven, I'll get back to you with what it was in the first quarter. 
Operator: We'll now take our next question from Pete Christiansen with Citi. 
Peter Christiansen: And thanks for the great slide deck, fantastic job there. Ron, I was wondering -- I know FLEETCOR is a completely different company 10-plus years ago, but at least from the small fleet side, I was just wondering if you could share some of the experiences that you had back in the last downturn in terms of, I guess, attrition and perhaps credit on the small fleet side, I think that would be just -- that would be helpful. 
Eric R. Dey: Pete, this is Eric. Yes, if you go back to 2008 and '09, I mean to your point, we are a completely different company today than we were back in 2008 and '09. But I'll comment a little bit on the fuel business, which is mostly what we had back then. So when we were into that downturn, we did see volumes soften pretty significantly. So we saw same-store sales softness kind of in the mid-single digits, so it was pretty high. Bad debt, it kind of squeaked up a little bit. We kind of ran -- I don't remember the exact numbers, but probably the mid- to high teens from a basis point standpoint in bad debt back then. And then it escalated to probably in the 40, 45 basis point range at its peak in 2008 and '09. So volumes down kind of in the high single digits, bad debt still, call it, kind of doubled over that -- in the fuel card segment. That's the kind of the business that we have then. 
Peter Christiansen: Right. That's helpful. And then as I look at the gift card business, there's been a couple of high-profile retailers filing lately. Can you walk us through what happens if you have a partner that does that? Are there changes in like breakage or availability of funds? Anything of that would be helpful. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Pete, it's Ron. So mostly in our gift business, we don't take much credit risk because we don't really move money, right? We're really an accounting system, if you will, for retailers and a program manager. So the one place where there's credit risk in that is in card shipments. So if you're at Macy's or Dick's Sporting Goods and we -- you give us a card order, and we go to the card maker and take the stock and make it for you, put the Macy's logo on it and then send it to you, that would be the one place, right? If we ship it to you, whatever, March 15 and then -- so you have to pay us on March 31 and you don't. And so the good news on that is that our guy that runs that business, right, have chased all that stuff pretty hard when this thing hit. So right now, we have very, very little exposure, fortunately. And I put him on notice that we're not doing many of those kind of things again. We're going to do a lot of card shipments to challenged retailers, at least not short term. So I'd say we're probably in a pretty good place there. 
Operator: We'll take our next question from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Ron, if you look across the business today, given everything that's going on, are you reassessing or thinking through where you'll invest in the future? Are there -- is this crisis kind of teaching any lessons in terms of changing priorities that you might have in terms of business investment? That could be product line, that could be geography. I know it's a very broad question. But do you feel sort of like it's just trying to hunker down with what we have today, and it will come out on the other end relatively intact? Or are there some more longer-term changes that you might kind of contemplate in terms of where you place your bets in the marketplace? 
Ronald F. Clarke: No. That's a really good question, Ramsey. I'd say, yes, I think like all of us on this call, we're processing what the future could be, what will the world look like in 3 months, 6 months. But for sure, I think there'll be changes. So on the portfolio side, I'd say we're super happy with the kind of the 4 categories that we've got, the 3 employee card things, fuel, lodging and toll, and then obviously, we like the payable things. So there's nothing in the 4 businesses where we go, "Oh, oh, I feel like I'm going to like those less." As I said in some of my comments, I think some of those categories will actually be helped by this thing. My sense is that a lot of our changes are going to be on the functional side. And what I mean by that is our constructs and our policies around, like, credit. Our approaches around selling. Our approaches around part time, full time. I think we're going through all kinds of thinking now of, if this world stays this way or there's some things we've learned in this world that we might stick with even if the world goes back to the way it was, I think there's going to be a lot of -- I'd say, it's still early. If you ask me that question again in 90 days, I think we'll have a better answer. But for sure, there will be a bunch of stuff we do different, for sure. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. And I was wondering also, and forgive me if I missed this before, but could you parse out a little bit of the same-store sales performance? Just in terms of -- sometimes you can give us incremental color on underlying verticals within some of your businesses on the same-store sales kind of... 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Eric will love to bring that, but I'll tell that obviously, the 2% drop was kind of all right in the last 2 weeks. So that means that dropped like a rock, obviously, given the April data that we've shown you. So I want to just prepare people that softness is what's taking our volume down. So you're going to hear a much different number in Q2. But you want to... 
Eric R. Dey: Yes. I mean just to give you a little color, Ramsey. What we saw was, as you can imagine, Ron indicated a lot of the softness that we saw happen in the last 2, 3 weeks of the month of March. But fuel was a little bit soft, probably came in 3%, 4% soft overall, and lodging overall was a bit soft. But don't forget, that includes the TA business as well, that was kind of in the 4% to 5% range. I think it was offset by strength that we saw in our corporate payments business, which was actually up and also strength in our Brazil business, which was also up a little bit because of the clients that we have there and the additional products that we've added. So it's a bit of a mixed bag, but the softness was kind of where you would think it would be and the strength that kind of where you thought it would be as well. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from David Togut with Evercore ISI. 
David Togut: Ron, the high customer revenue retention historically of 91% to 92% has been a strength of the business. You closed the first quarter at 90.7%. As you look into Q2, which you've called as the likely trough, can you maintain customer revenue retention in the 90% to 92% range? 
Ronald F. Clarke: David, it's a good question. I'd say we don't know. I think it's going to be a function a bit of the help of clients, honestly, and what the casualty rate is and the BK rate among our client base. And so a lot of the retention aggregate number is a function of mix. We have businesses that have very different kinds of retention rates based on size, enterprise versus small and then even type of business like payables growth, the spend growth of clients. So I don't know the answer. I guess it will probably be lower because we'll likely have more casualties in our client base where the businesses go out of business, which is already represent, and then credit. So again, if you simplistically said, "Hey, we lose 9% or 10% of our revenue per year." 1/3 or 1/2 of that is the business getting back, the business getting weak, the business closing, the business not having the creditworthiness to be a client. 
 So yes, my guess is that's probably going to go up some in the quarter. Now again, once you get to that base, we get through this thing, that there's nothing structural that concerns me that would take us lower. 
David Togut: I see. Understood. Just as a quick final question, and I apologize if you addressed this earlier, but looking at capital allocation priorities. You bought back $530 million of stock in the first quarter so you're very active. You have $326 million left on the repurchase authorization. Will you be deploying cash towards share repurchases in this environment, possibly looking more at acquisitions? The seller expectations come down. Or will you be more in the mode of husbanding capital? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. David, another good question. I'll let Eric comment, too. But I'd say we're in a preserve mode. We are -- I told the Board. We agreed with the Board. We are in a precaution. We want the maximum liquidity. We want a company that got all kinds of cushion until we see the other side of this and see the heartbeat on the other side. So we will not be buying back shares over the next quarter or 2. On the other side, I think, on the deal side, like I said, if there's something unique that comes out of this, we might pull the trigger a little bit sooner than later. But I'd say we're probably in a bit of a hold pattern for a while. 
Operator: And there are no further telephone questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks. 
James Eglseder: Guys, thanks for being on the call. Let us know if you have any additional questions, if you need anything else. Have a good night. 
Operator: And once again, that does conclude today's presentation. We thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-06 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the FLEETCOR Technologies Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. 
 I will now turn the conference over to our host, Jim Eglseder, Senior Vice President of Global Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. 
James Eglseder: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today are Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO; and Eric Dey, our CFO. Following comments from Ron and Eric, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. It is only then that the queue will open for questions.  Please note, our earnings and the supplement can be found under the Investor Relations section on our website at fleetcor.com. Throughout this call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than non-GAAP information at other companies. Reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today's press release and on our website, as previously described. We are also providing 2020 guidance on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis with reconciliations. 
 Now before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements. This includes forward-looking statements about our guidance and outlook, new products and initiatives and expectations regarding business development and acquisitions. They are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore, you should not put undue reliance upon them. These results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned today in our press release and on Form 8-K, on our annual report on Form 10-K that is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available on our website and at sec.gov. 
 With that out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay, Jim, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone, and appreciate you joining our fourth quarter earnings call. Upfront here, I plan to cover 4 subjects: first, provide my view of our Q4 finish; second, take a bit of a look back at our full year 2019 highlights; third, I'll preview our 2020 guidance; and then, lastly, I'll outline our priorities over the coming years. 
 Okay. So on to the quarter. We reported Q4 revenue of $699 million, that's up 9%; and $3.17 in cash EPS, up 14%. Revenue finished a bit better than we had forecasted 90 days ago, I'd say, with the exception of gift, which came in light. Profits also at the high end of our expectations, helped a bit by a lower tax rate. Organic growth, good, overall finished at 10% in Q4. Fuel card growth inside of that at 9% for the quarter. Our 3 nonfuel lines' organic growth, quite good: tolls, up 17%; lodging, up 14%; and corporate pay, also up 14%. Trends remained quite good, what we call new sales or new bookings grew 13% in the quarter. Client revenue retention staying steady at just over 91%, and our same-store sales finished at 0.5 point negative, impacted mainly by the weak trucking vertical. 
 Our Beyond strategy or Beyond initiatives, continued forward progress. And toll, just a great Q4, the Beyond toll, or what we call urban tag, sales in the quarter, 125,000 new tags sold in Q4. As a reminder, that's up from 4,000 in Q1, about 20,000 in Q2, and I think it was 58,000 in Q3. So clearly, evidence that the 20 million urban user target opportunity is starting to like our city-based parking, fuel and fast food offer. 
 In the fuel business, our Beyond fuel here in the U.S., again, continued good progress. We added 1,300 new companion card accounts to that program. So continuing to grow that. In corporate pay, going beyond our virtual card and selling what we call full AP outsourcing, or 100% of a client's invoices, we closed 4 million in new business in the quarter. We also continue to process 3 or 4 tuck-in acquisitions hoping to make some final decisions on those here in Q1. 
 So look, in summary, a good Q4, a good finish. Organic revenue growth at 10%; cash EPS, up 14%; new sales, good, up 13%; client revenue retention, steady, 91%; and we're continuing to advance our Beyond initiatives. 
 Okay. Let me transition to a look back at just some of our 2019 full year highlights. So first, profits advanced 12% to $11.79 in cash EPS that was well ahead of our initial 2019 guidance of $11.55. Second, organic revenue growth, full year growth at 11%. That's the highest annual level since we began reporting this metric. So for full year '19: fuel, up 9%; corporate pay, 20%; toll, 16%; lodging, 13%. So quite good. Third, our technology, getting better. We stabilized a few platforms in '19. We strengthened our IT team with a few new hires, and we continue to invest more in cybersecurity. Four, our trends, again, full year trends, quite positive: new sales, up 14% for the full year; client revenue retention, over 91%, for the full year. We broke the $1 billion cash net income threshold in '19, operating cash flow above $1 billion for the first time. We completed 4 tuck-in acquisitions for $450 million. We continue to advance our Beyond initiatives and their contribution to the company. And then, lastly, FLT, our stock had a good year. Price up over 50% in 2019, which is well ahead of the broader market. So all in all, a pretty good year. 
 Let me now make a turn to 2020 and outline our initial guidance for the year, along with the assumptions that are behind it. So first off, I'd say we like the setup heading into 2020. So the macro, which was quite challenging in '19, is setting up much better for us in 2020. Yes, we do expect about a $20 million revenue headwind in 2020, most is a result of the Brazil FX. But that will be largely offset by expected lower interest rates and a bit lower tax rate. So really effectively neutralizing the overall environment on our 2020 profit plan. So good news there. Our 2019 trends will roll into 2020, so that helps us. Last year's sales rolling in and steady client retention. Our Beyond contribution, again, we're expecting a bit more help in '20 from those initiatives. The 4 deals, we'll get the full year benefit of our 4 tuck-in acquisitions. We expect to get about 3% cash EPS accretion from those. And then, lastly, our share repurchase, we did announce our December ASR. That will reduce our 2020 share count, although offset a bit by the incremental interest expense. So look, taken together, these factors will help support our profit growth plans in 2020. 
 If you turn to our 4 major businesses, we're out looking a pretty promising 2020. In the fuel segment, we see a bit of a mixed bag. Some markets, Russia, Mexico, Brazil and Australia, expecting to all be double-digit growers in 2020. But the core U.S. and U.K. businesses will rely on help from the beyond fuel initiatives, and they're generating more spend and more revenue from some of our existing clients. Also, expecting continued weakness in the truck [indiscernible]. 
 In corporate pay, outlooking our FX business to have another strong year in 2020, good momentum. Our core virtual card business has got a couple of new channel or partner opportunities that could be quite big and quite exciting. And our full AP business, we expect to be way up this year, both as we implement sales from the prior year and capture the full year benefit of our network synergies. 
 Brazil, expecting the core toll business to have another healthy tag volume growth year. That's being supported by a couple of new sales partnerships. We're expecting further acceleration of our beyond toll or urban program in 2020. There, our city fueling, parking and fast food network continues to expand. We do expect Brazil inflation to be quite a bit lower this year, which will reduce the Brazil revenue growth likely into the lower teens. 
 In lodging, we're looking for the SMB segment there, that growth to accelerate. We've made some pretty significant improvements to our electronic booking capability, making it easier for small business to use our product. We've also expanded the network there. We are planning to capture hotel rate synergies and some virtual card synergies as we onboard our Travelliance acquisition fully this year. 
 So with that, our guidance for 2020 is as follows. Revenue, guiding to $2.930 billion at the midpoint that reflects an 11% increase. Organic revenue, we're guiding in the 9% to 11% range overall. Fuel, expected in the 6% to 8% range, and the 3 nonfuel businesses in the low to high-teens range. Sales growth, outlooking another 13% to 15% sales growth year. Profit growth, guiding to $13.55 of cash EPS at the midpoint. That reflects a 15% increase. So this 2020 guidance is consistent with the midterm targets of 10% revenue growth and 15% to 20% profit growth. 
 Okay. Lastly, let me transition over to how we're thinking about the company's priorities over the midterm. So first is our portfolio. So we continue to see greater diversity. The company is now approaching 60% of all revenue outside of fuel. So we're continuing to reposition the company for faster growth. So in addition to where we started, employee-related expenses like fuel, toll and hotels, we're now expanding into helping businesses with their employee payroll and benefit-related expenses and their supplier, vendor or payables-related expenses. So clearly, these 2 big expense categories dramatically expand our TAM and runway. 
 Adjacent view of acquisitions. So we're starting to look at acquisitions in a bit of a new light. So beyond chasing acquisitions that fit inside of our 4 served categories, fuel, lodging, toll and payables, we're starting to look at some deals that might potentially broaden our client offerings. So for example, in the payable segment, maybe considering some procurement-related software solutions that simplify the front-end of payables. So finding ways to help clients a bit more broadly around the area that we help them with their payments. 
 Our 4 major lines of business clearly expect to penetrate those further over the midterm, but as we've -- we tried to articulate our Beyond strategy is hopefully redefining those 4 segments and how we serve them. So again, for example, targeting urban or city users in Brazil or targeting airlines versus workforce prospects in our lodging business. So really trying to rethink our existing 4 lines of business to extend the growth profile. 
 And then, lastly, we're trying to strengthen just the core capabilities of the company. Clearly, focused on technology, trying to transform our architecture. We're doubling down on digital and working to build products that make it much easier to do business with our company. And people, continuing to add, invest in people and people quality to put the best team we can on the field. So we think these priorities set the company up really for continued growth over a much longer time frame. 
 So look, in closing, again, Q4, we thought quite good, good finish to the year 2020. Again, we like the setup, and we're expecting revenue and profit growth consistent with our long-term targets. And then the future, again, continuing to transform and reposition the company for faster growth, widening the sandbox and trying to strengthen really our core capabilities. 
 So with that, let me turn the call back over to Eric to provide some additional details on the quarter. Eric? 
Eric R. Dey: Thank you, Ron. For the fourth quarter of 2019, we reported revenue of $698.9 million, up 9%, compared to $643.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. GAAP net income decreased 22% to $235.5 million or $2.60 per diluted share from $302 million or $3.33 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2018. Included in the fourth quarter of 2019 was a gain of $13 million related to a minority investment and in the fourth quarter of 2018 was a gain of $153 million from the sale of the Chevron portfolio.  Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2019 increased 14% to $286.4 million compared to $252 million and adjusted net income per diluted share increased 14% to $3.17 compared to $2.78 in the fourth quarter of 2018. 
 We experienced several macroeconomic headwinds in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with the fourth quarter of 2018. Movements in foreign exchange rates were primarily negative, with most of the impact from the Brazilian real as the currency was down roughly 7% from the fourth quarter of 2018. We believe foreign exchange rates negatively impacted revenue during the quarter by approximately $9 million. In addition, fuel prices were lower by approximately 5% compared with the fourth quarter last year. And although we cannot precisely calculate the impact of these price changes, we believe our revenue was negatively impacted by approximately $2 million. And finally, fuel spreads had about an $8 million negative impact on the quarter compared with a very good spread setup in the fourth quarter of last year. So in total, those changes had a negative impact of approximately $19 million on our fourth quarter revenue compared with the fourth quarter of 2018. 
 Organic revenue growth in the quarter was 10% overall. All of our major product categories performed well during the quarter. The corporate payments category continues to perform very well, and was up 14% organically during the quarter. The growth in corporate payments was driven by both Cambridge, which grew 20% in the quarter versus very tough comps, and the remainder of the corporate payments business, which grew in the mid-teens. 
 Our toll business was up 17% organically and our lodging business was up 14%. And as expected, our fuel card business produced 9% organic growth in the quarter. As always, there are a number of -- a lot of moving parts to our businesses around the world. We continue to see some softness in our over-the-road businesses, but was offset by some strong performances in some of our international businesses. 
 Now moving down the income statement. Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $378.1 million compared to $358.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, up approximately 5%. The increase was primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2019. As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses were approximately 54% compared to 56% in the fourth quarter of 2018. Credit losses were $20 million for the fourth quarter or 7 basis points compared to $21 million or 8 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2018. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 2% to $68.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 from $67.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase was primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2019 and additional CapEx spending. Interest expense decreased 8% to $35 million compared to $38.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. The decrease in interest expense was due primarily to decreases in LIBOR, partially offset by additional borrowing for share buybacks and acquisitions. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 21.1% compared to 23.9% for the fourth quarter of 2018. The fourth quarter of 2019 tax rate was lower than the fourth quarter of 2018 due primarily to excess tax benefits. 
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.680 billion in total cash. Approximately $404 million is restricted and consists primarily of customer deposits. As of December 31, 2019, we had $4 billion outstanding on our term loan and revolver and approximately $638 million in undrawn availability. We also had $971 million borrowed in our securitization facility at the end of the quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we purchased approximately 2.2 million shares of our stock for $632.5 million, resulting in a total share buyback for 2019 of approximately 2.4 million shares for $695 million. Our total current repurchase authorization remained at $857 million. 
 As of December 31, 2019, our leverage ratio was 2.43x EBITDA, which is well below our covenant level of 4x EBITDA as calculated under our credit agreement. The increase was due to borrowing for share buybacks and acquisitions in 2019. We intend to use our future excess cash flow to temporarily pay down the balance on our revolving credit facility and securitization facility, and maintain liquidity for acquisitions and other corporate purposes. And finally, CapEx expense in the quarter was $26.5 million. 
 Now on to the update for the outlook for 2020. Before I walk you through our 2020 outlook, there are a number of puts and takes I want to make sure you have considered as you model the walk from 2019 actuals to our 2020 guidance. Please refer to our fourth quarter earnings call supplement for a bridge from 2019 to 2020 revenue and adjusted net income per share. 
 First, we are planning for another 9% to 11% organic growth rate year and adjusted net income growth rate of approximately 15% at the midpoint of our guidance range. We expect the corporate payments, toll and lodging businesses to grow mid-teens in 2020, and gift and other to be up slightly. The fuel card category is expected to grow organically in the 6% to 8% range. Growth is expected to be led by continued solid performances in most of our fuel card businesses. However, growth will be tempered by softness in our over-the-road freight businesses as we expect current market conditions to persist in 2020. Also, our 2020 guidance includes the Chevron divestiture impact of approximately $12 million in revenue in 2019. 
 I also want to update you on our latest thinking about the macroeconomic environment. We expect the macro to negatively impact our revenue and profit for 2020. We are estimating that the absolute price of fuel will be about the same as the 2019 average. Foreign exchange rates, if they continue to be at today's level, will also have a modest negative impact on revenue, and spreads will be slightly unfavorable to 2019. In total, we believe these items will create an estimated $20 million revenue headwind and negatively impact cash EPS by about $0.10 to $0.15 per share. Although our share count will be lower in 2019 due to the fourth quarter share buybacks, we had to borrow on our revolver to finance the share buybacks. So in total, we expect the net impact of the lower shares and increased borrowing to finance the shares to have a negative overall impact for 2020 of about $0.10 per share. 
 And finally, we expect our tax rate to be in the 20% to 22% range, slightly lower than the 2019 average tax rate. There are a number of moving parts to the tax calculation, but we are expecting additional share-based compensation-related deductions to favorably impact our tax rate in 2020. 
 So with that out of the way, our guidance for 2020 is as follows: total revenues between $2.900 billion and $2.960 billion; net income to be between $965 million and $1.005 billion; net income per diluted share to be between $10.80 and $11.20; adjusted net income to be between $1.190 billion and $1.230 billion; and adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $13.35 and $13.75, or $13.55 at the midpoint. This guidance represents approximately an 11% growth in revenue and 15% growth in adjusted net income per diluted share for the year at the midpoint of the range. 
 So in summary, the fundamentals of the business are quite good. Another year of guiding to 9% to 11% organic revenue growth and 15% normalized adjusted net income per share growth before the impacts of divestments and the macro. Some of the assumptions we have made in preparing the guidance include the following: weighted fuel price is equal to $2.78 per gallon average in the U.S. for those businesses sensitive in the movement in the retail price of fuel; market spreads slightly unfavorable to the 2019 average; foreign exchange rates equal to the 7-day average as of the week ending January 19, 2020; interest expense of $130 million to $140 million; fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately 89.5 million shares; and adjusted tax rate of 20% to 22%. And as always, no impact related to acquisitions or material new partnership agreements not already disclosed. 
 Now for the first quarter. I want to remind everyone that our business has some seasonality, and that typically, the first quarter is the lowest in terms of both revenue and profit. First quarter seasonality is impacted by weather, holidays in the U.S. and lower business levels in Brazil due to summer break and the carnival celebration that occurs in the first quarter. Also, the first quarter revenue will be impacted by a $10 million unfavorable macro impact, mostly foreign exchange rates when compared to the first quarter of 2019; the Chevron divestiture, which impacted revenue by approximately $8 million; and the net impact of share repurchases and the associated interest expense carry versus prior year. In total, we estimate these items will negatively impact our first quarter net income per share by approximately $0.15 versus the first quarter of 2019. With that said, we are expecting our first quarter 2019 adjusted net income per share to be between $2.90 and $3. Additionally, our volumes should build throughout the year, and our new initiatives should gain momentum throughout the year, resulting in higher revenue, organic growth and earnings per share in the second through fourth quarters. 
 With that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. 
Ramsey El-Assal: I wanted to ask about the corporate payments segment. It's still healthy growth there. It came in -- the organic growth rate came in below our model. I just wanted to kind of dig in a little bit there to see if there is anything has changed in terms of how you're viewing this segment. And I guess, in particular, going into 2020, is there any adjustment to your long-term thinking about the way, for example, Cambridge and Virtual card, both contribute to the overall growth rate there? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Ramsey, it's Ron. So the 14% headwind is pretty weak payroll card kind of subcategory, which is kind of flat. So if you pull that out, our core corporate pay was actually up 18% in Q4. And then, second, in Q4 of '18, there was a bunch of political spend because it was the 2-year cycle. I don't have it in front of me, but I'm sure the growth rate in corporate pay in Q4 of '18 would have been super high. So that made the comp, if you will, of this quarter against the '18 quarter quite tough, because of the political spend in Q4 '19. 
 And then the second part of it, okay, what's the forward view, I'd say, high teens. I'd say, I don't have it in front of me, but if you said, "Hey, what do we think that whole corporate pay business will do that's embedded in our guidance?" I'd say we're outlooking high teens. And again, it does bump around by quarter. I think it has even here in '19. But we were investing to have that business keep pacing out in the high teens. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. I appreciate that. I also wanted to ask about the FTC lawsuit and see if you had any comment on that? Any thoughts on timing? And just also, maybe embedded in your response, you could address the kind of potential risk if there could be any actual changes to your business practices that come out of this lawsuit as it gets eventually concluded. Or is this more just effectively a negotiation about a penalty payment? 
Eric R. Dey: Ramsey, this is Eric. I guess, first and foremost, there's been really no change since the complaint was filed by the FTC about 30 days-or-so ago. So we really don't have an update on the lawsuit itself, given the short period of time. We have made a number of comments around what we think the materiality of it is going to be, and our thinking is the same, and we don't think it's going to have a material impact on our business going forward. Yes, we have some conversations around redress, but those are still TBD at this point in time. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Peter Christiansen with Citibank. 
Peter Christiansen: Ron, I guess with any type of business, there's always a pricing trade-off attrition issue that managers need to consider. I guess if you're looking across, particularly the fuel card business, how do you think about that trade-off between pricing and attrition? And has that changed? 
Ronald F. Clarke: I think it's fair, sure there is. I'd say that we're probably steady as she goes. I don't think we're making any material changes in fuel card pricing, either here or rest of the world. I think a bit of the reason for the thing guiding down a little bit in '20, is, a, we had a pretty good year. I think the full year this year was 9% organically. So a little bit better comp. And then b, really, it's credit. I'd say with the EMV thing being late in fuel, we're continuing to get chased by the bad guys at gas stations. And so I'd say the credit dynamics were worse in '19 in the fuel card business than we thought. And so we've had to take some actions, basically, to tighten credit, credit lines, the amount that people can spend, et cetera. So I'd say that's for certain part of the reasons we guide. 
Peter Christiansen: Is there any -- do you have an estimate of what percentage of provisions are cost to fraud? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Say it again, Peter, one more time. 
Peter Christiansen: What percentage of your provision expense has been fraudulent charges? And where has that mix of bankruptcy versus fraud kind of expenses there? How has that trended in recent quarters? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I don't have it super handy, but I'd say it's circa under $10 million of what we call fraud. I'd say the 2 kinds of fraud are basically application fraud, right? Someone makes up there an actual business, and they never are. And then fundamentally, fraud at the gas station, where someone fundamentally fills up tanks, if you will. And so I don't have it in front of me. We can circle back on it. But for sure, those 2 numbers are up in '19 over prior years. 
Eric R. Dey: And don't forget, as we migrate to chip and PIN next year, our fraud losses are going to decrease over a period of time, and hopefully, to be very minimal after October next year when hopefully, everybody's converted to the new chip and PIN requirement. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. 
Andrew Jeffrey: Ron, I'm intrigued by your comments with regard to perhaps evolving M&A priorities and opportunities. Could you talk a little bit more about sort of corporate procurement and what that might look like in terms of augmenting the payable software offering you already have? Should we think about that as looking a little bit like what Coupa is doing? Or just a little color would be helpful. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean I think the headline is we've gotten into these 2 bigger categories, Andrew, the payroll and benefits and into the payables. So beyond just employee related, the idea of software, right? The clients are using different kinds of software to help them, clearly, in the payroll or benefit administration area and using software in and around payables, whether it's procurement or workflow and stuff. And so I think the idea is that there are some targets that nest around that, that are kind of in front of the payment. The payment is kind of the thing at the end. And so I think the thinking we've been doing over the last 6 months is, hey, hey, hey, if we bolted on some of that software that's in front of, basically, the payment, could we create a better bundled experience with the client? And obviously, it's obvious that those companies might have clients. So it might be an entrée for us into the payment thing that we do. So I wouldn't say we're ready to pull the trigger, but I'd say it's a concept in causing us to explore a set of targets that we didn't really look at 6 months ago. 
Andrew Jeffrey: Okay. All right. It would be interesting to see how you proceed. And just a point of clarification, if I may, around fuel. I understand OTR is soft and manufacturing have been in a recession for a couple of years now, or at least a year anyway. The 6% to 8% guidance versus the sort of the 9% in '19, does that suggest that beyond fuel it's facing tougher comps or deselling? Or I wonder if you could just parse out how much of that might be economic, same-store sales related, how much of it is sort of grow over in beyond fuel. I thought beyond fuel might offset some of the same-store sales weakness. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. A combo of all those things you said. So one, it's obviously a good comp, a good growth rate in '19. Two is trucking not only in the U.S., but in Brazil, and the U.K. is weak. And I think we called it out in our same-store sales. It was, I think, minimized 4% to 5% negative range in the base in terms of softness. So it's quite weak. And then I think I mentioned the last one is, it's credit. So for example, we get a very large number of our new fuel card accounts digitally now in the U.S. I think it's approaching 75% of all the new accounts we acquire. And so we've had to moderate what we can offer both credit at all and certainly, credit for beyond fuel via that channel based on the credit experience that we've got. So we've decided to just going cautiously. I don't want to blow the thing up, so we're going in kind of slow, careful. Let the stuff we signed up in '19 bed in. Study the credit dynamics of it and then kind of expand it. So it might do better, Andrew, as we pace our way through the year, but I -- we really want to win pretty cautiously on the credit side. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Just following up on Andrew's question, just on the Beyond side. I'm curious, is there a way you guys to quantify the impact in the fourth quarter or the lift in the fourth quarter and what the assumption would be in 2020 just for the Beyond initiative? 
Ronald F. Clarke: It's kind of in the 1% to 2% range, Tien-Tsin, is what I'd say. And again, we now have something in the base, but I don't have it in front of me. But we have obviously real revenue, and all the Beyond initiatives now finally in '19 and certainly in Q4. So they're all planning to be up. But again, they're coming off a relatively small basis. So it's something we could probably dig out and come back. But I'd say, across the board, it's kind of 1% to 2%. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Okay. And then when you mentioned broadening your client offerings, I know you gave payables as an example. But I'm curious the tangential stuff that you're willing to look at, how far are you willing to go from the core to meet this broadened client offering initiative? I mean I'm just -- can you give us a little bit more there? How far from the core are you interested in going? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Not super far would be the headline. And so the first one is we were fanatics around models. So we got to like the business model a lot first separate from what the business is. And then, second, it's got to be connected in some way. I referenced that procurement software example, because I think it's relatively easy to understand that. If you're AP heading a company and get ready to manage 1,000 invoices, you've got to have some set of software, either in your ERP or others to keep track of the vendors and whether you should have them all and when you should pay them. There's a lot of work to do before you click pay. And so things like that seem obvious to us as ways to maybe get clients more interested in a broader bundle. But we're not going to go crazy. We're just really trying to highlight that there's some adjacent things that are close to what we do that we like. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Okay. Last one, if you don't mind, just on the M&A side. Do you -- should we think of '20 looking like '19 in terms of doing a few similar-sized deals, like an Nvoicepay, Travelliance, SOLE? Or could we see some bigger deals in 2020 if you have your way? Anything that's holding you back there? 
Ronald F. Clarke: I certainly hope so, would be my answer. I've got my cheat sheet, a big elephant sitting here in front of me, and actually had a review yesterday on it. So our sights are set. I'm trying to do something big. As Eric referenced, our balance sheet is probably in as good a better place than it's ever been. So we are eager, probably like others on the phone, to do something. But I told you before, Tien-Tsin, we're not going to rush just because it's a good thing to do, but we're certainly interested in doing it. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: I guess my first question is on the investments that are being made. Can you guys walk us through where those investments are being made? And what's driving some of these investments? Is it that you're being offensive? Or are those areas where you think, competitively, you could do better? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Sanjay, it's Ron. So I'd say, if you think about the sequential step in, in investments, it's one, some pro forma roll forward of the acquisitions. So some of the expense growth as you roll into '20 is really just 12 months of deals that carry lower margins, right, in our core business, that'd be number 1. Number 2 would be just traditional kind of line of business processing, servicing kinds of expenses that go hand-in-hand with the volume growth that we have planned. 
 But the 2 bigger discretionary ones would be IT and sales. And what we saw, we've been modeling the last 2 or 3 months, the fact that our tax rate will probably step down about a point. I think we finished around 22% and change for '19. When Eric and I saw the number trending, I think we guided 20% to 22%.  So we used 21% at the midpoint. We said, "Hey, there's an opportunity maybe to make a few investments in sales and IT." So we added a bit more really around transformation. I'd say instead of just projects, we're trying to have better data warehouses, move more processing to the cloud, improve our API layers as we connect, double down on the UIs for customers in terms of how they interact with us. So it's just -- it's a series of, I call it, different kinds of IT. Obviously, we're spending significantly more in and around cybersecurity. So it's investments in what we call non-line of business project investments that we're looking at. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Okay. And then just a follow-up on all Fleet M&A questions. I guess when we think about broadening the scope of these acquisitions, is it because there's not a lot of attractive stuff at the core and the valuations just aren't attractive enough? Or is it more that these are viable opportunities to get the same types of returns as you have elsewhere and it really adds another dimension to your offering? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I think it's really outside in. It's trying to look at the world that our clients and prospects fit in and how they go about doing their work and us identifying very adjacent kinds of software and services that look a lot like what we do. So I'd say that the first driver of it is to try to package things that help clients basically do their work. And then the second one is what you said. It creates obviously a bigger sandbox to go work in, and obviously, again, may create some cross-selling opportunities of getting client bases that are in similar areas. So it's all of the above. And again, we're going to be quite cautious and have a lot of conviction before we pull the trigger. But I want to give everyone a heads up that, that software and services adjacency is something that we are looking at so that people could be prepared if we tell you that. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: But just a clarification. In terms of the accretion potential of any of these types of deals, is it similar to the stuff that you've done before? Or is it different? 
Ronald F. Clarke: They vary. We've looked at some fair number of these in the last 6 months. I mean as you know, the box of buying things that have both revenue growth and accretion opportunities all in one are not always super easy. And I think that's been a bit of a guide for us the last couple of years. It's not buying assets that are only accretive that don't have midterm growth prospects. So I'd say we're trying to make sure we look at deals that have both of those characteristics. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. 
Ashish Sabadra: A question on the toll, pretty good momentum there. You talked about pretty good traction on the 20 million urban user opportunity. You also mentioned potential slowdown in tolls to low teens. It's just still pretty healthy. And I guess it's mostly because of inflation. But I was just wondering if you can talk about how we should think about the urban user contribution going forward and the tailwind from the urban user going forward. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Ashish, it's Ron. Yes, that's a good question. So I guess you hit one of them. So if you said, "Hey, hey, why might Brazil organic growth step back a little bit from 2019?" One is what you said that inflation has gone backward a bit in Brazil. So a bit less of that is baked in. And then number two, I think that we are open to acquiring new accounts with longer free trial periods, which takes, in a sense, some of the pricing of the new business down. And the reason for that is that some of the competitors, the banks in Brazil, have been offering 6- or 12-month starts on the toll programs. And so although we believe we're the premium brand and network, we want to make sure we're still getting that business. So that would be the second one. 
 In terms of the urban thing, I mean, let me put into context how big we think this could be. So in my opening remarks, I commented that we sold 125,000 new urban tags in the quarter, so call it circa 200,000 new users that signed up in 2019. I don't have the plan in front of me, but my guess is it's somewhere between 200,000 and 300,000 new urban users planned for 2020. We only sign up about 1 million new users, standard toll users per year. And so the impact, as you roll that snowball forward, if we can sign up 200,000, 250,000 and keep signing up 1 million, that number starts to get quite meaningful. So I'd say the one thing we've got evidence of now is that this offer to use an RFID convenient payment thing in and around the city at a bunch of places is something people like, and to tell you that we're able to actually communicate it and sell it. And so now we've got to try to scale it. We've got to build out the network further, which we've got money in for, and we've got to keep adding those number of users. So we're bullish on it, but I think it could be a pretty meaningful number here over the midterm. 
Ashish Sabadra: That's very helpful. And then just maybe a follow-up question on the investments in digital and sales, that's pretty positive. How should -- how are you going to track the ROI on those investments? How should we think about the retention as well as sales booking going forward as you make these investments? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. So the sales one, I'd say that one is shorter term. We, as you guys know, build models to increase sales investment year-over-year and increase sales production year-over-year. So that example, I'd say, we're planning, I think, I commented, 13% to 15% incremental sales production this year. And my guess is we're probably spending low teens incremental sales investment to accomplish that. I'd say the IT one is different. I'd say the incremental money we decided to invest this year is a bit nontraditional for us. It's more architecture, infrastructure and structural, if you will, allowing us to do things easier, better to make changes in applications, to write stuff on co-basis that fill all platforms to get stuff running on old, multi, single-client hardware into a cloud environment with better economics. So I'd say that they're probably a year or 2 out, the returns on this new set of IT things. But for us, I think the key is we have to simplify the technology footprint and application footprint that we have. And so we're making some investment in 2020 to get positioned to do that. 
Operator: Our next question comes from George Mihalos with Cowen and Company. 
Georgios Mihalos: Good to be on the call, guys. Maybe just to kind of circle back on the corporate payment side. Ron, I appreciate your commentary on growth kind of being in the high teens, looking out in the 2020. Should we expect any change, though, in the rates of growth for the cross-border business versus sort of traditional virtual card kind of putting full file outsourcing to decide and just focusing on those 2 segments or subsegments? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, again, the high teens number still includes that payroll card subset, which, again, is not planned to grow super. So again, if we kind of move that out, the core corporate pay might do even a bit better. I'd say, yes, we probably are thinking about Cambridge, the FX business a bit slower. So we've grown that thing obviously in a couple of years, 20% plus on the top and more on the bottom. I'd say that the combo of our old line virtual card idea and our new line full AP outsourcing, that, that thing, again, is planned in the high teens. So really, both major businesses, both the payables business and the FX business are kind of hand-in-hand in terms of the growth rate. 
Georgios Mihalos: Okay, very helpful. And just one point of clarification. With your sights set on potentially larger scale M&A, will that sort of put a pause or a hold on buyback activity over the beginning of the year? 
Eric R. Dey: George, it's Eric. Probably not. I mean the reality is we do have a lot of liquidity. As we've stated earlier, our balance sheet is in as best placed as really it's ever been. Our leverage is low. And listen, we've got plenty of liquidity, basically, to pursue both avenues, and that's what we want to do. So I wouldn't say we're not going to do it. 
Operator: Our next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. 
David Togut: Just to expand upon the beyond toll initiative in Brazil, recognizing this is a very different initiative than what you have in the U.S. with beyond fuel, do you have any credit concerns about Brazil as you do about the U.S.? In other words, is there any break on the growth of this kind of beyond toll initiative? And then related to that, I think, historically, you've given out some transaction growth numbers on the expansion of your McDonald's relationship in Brazil. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, David. It's Ron. So yes, on the credit side, it's a good question. I'd say 2 things. One, that some large amount of our new business, we're booking on to credit card. So literally, we're not taking credit risk for, I'm going to say, call it, 2/3 of that new business that we're booking. And then obviously, the other 1/3, we're screening and determining that it's pretty creditworthy. So the credit dynamics in that market actually improved, believe it or not, in 2019 over the prior year. And we've got it modeled to kind of flattish going in 2020. So I'd say that sitting here today, the credit dynamics or risks aren't slowing us down on that. What's slowing us down there is trying to build out the nonfuel network. That's really the governor on speed there. 
David Togut: I see. And then McDonald's transaction growth? Any metrics there for the fourth quarter? 
Ronald F. Clarke: I don't have it in front of me. I know it's up, and it's planned to be up again in 2020. I think we've got, I can't remember, 75 additional locations that we're putting on. So it will be 2.5 million to 3 million would be my guesstimate without having a piece of paper in front of me. 
David Togut: Understood. Just a quick final question. Is the Mastercard fuel card in the U.S. still giving you differentiated growth versus the more traditional fuel card business? And if you have the growth rate for that business in the fourth quarter, that would be appreciated. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Ask it -- you just broke up for a second. Ask it, David, again, if you would? 
David Togut: Yes. Historically, you've given out quarterly transaction growth for the Mastercard fuel card, the interchange product. And I'm just curious if that -- and that product historically has grown faster than the core fuel card business. Was that still the case in the fourth quarter? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Eric, do you have that in front of you? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes, I don't have it exactly in front of me. We really don't talk about the individual lines of business. But it's -- if I recall, I think it grew kind of line average in the quarter with the growth of the whole fuel sector. Something in that ballpark. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I'd say, David, back again, I don't know the number, but the concept of this 2 for idea, particularly with our field people or phone people, to be able to offer a business, fuel cards that control fuel spend and then also on "1 account", help that company with payables or help open up the card for some employees for supplies or construction supplies. It's clearly a winning pitch. And then I saw some exhibit, I don't know, in the fourth quarter, where in Q2 and Q3, about 25% of all of our new sales were these 2 for sales, where this concept of adding payables to the account or some supplies, sometimes with different users in the account, is a very interesting offer. So I think the concept and the offer of this expanded product is good. 
Operator: Our next question is from Ryan Cary with Bank of America. 
Ryan Cary: It sounds like your underlying trucking environment remains tough, particularly in the U.S. and the U.K. But if we were to compare that to what you're seeing in the 3Q, it sounds like it weakened a little bit further. First, is that fair? And then second, while these headwinds are likely to persist into 2020, are you expecting we're past the trough? Or could things get worse before they get better? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Ryan, it's Ron. Yes, I'm looking at it, at a piece of paper. I'd say the trucking base softness got a little bit worse than Q3. It actually got worse kind of all throughout '19. We kind of planned it on the line that it's on, which, again, is soft. I don't know. I don't think we know that the U.K. is down not as much. Brazil is also, trucking, for some reason, is down some. So it has gotten a bit worse during '19, and we are planning it to be at the negative kind of 3% to 5% range in our 2020 guidance. 
Ryan Cary: Got it. Okay. And then just a quick clarification on Beyond initiatives. Was the 1% to 2% incremental revenue growth contribution from the Beyond initiatives inclusive of both fuel and toll? And if it is, is there any way to break that up into the individual contribution from the fuel side and then from the toll side? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I think what we should do because Tien-Tsin asked that earlier, I think that we should try to put together a more embedded exhibit, where we go kind of line of business by line of business and give you guys some color on what the contributions are in the 2020 numbers rather than just throw it out, because they do vary in each of our 4 major categories, right? The Beyond efforts are different. The maturity, if you will, of them are different and stuff. And so, Jim, just remind us. 
James Eglseder: Yes, we'll take that, Ryan, as a takeaway and come back to you guys with something that hopefully is useful. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn it back to management for closing remarks. Thank you. 
James Eglseder: Thanks for joining us today, guys. As always, this is Jim, let me know if you have any further questions or if you need anything else. 
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's call. All parties may disconnect. Have a great evening.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-11-06 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the FLEETCOR Technologies Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Jim Eglseder, Head of Investor Relations for FLEETCOR Technologies. Thank you, sir. You may begin. 
James Eglseder: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our third quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today are Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO; and Eric Dey, our CFO. Following comments from both Ron and Eric, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for a Q&A session. It is only then that the queue will open for questions.
  Please note, our earnings release and supplement can be found under the Investor Relations section of our website at fleetcor.com. Throughout this call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than non-GAAP information at other companies.
  Reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today's press release and on our website as previously described. We are also providing updated 2019 guidance under the GAAP and non-GAAP basis with reconciliations.
  Now before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements. This includes forward-looking statements about our guidance and outlook, new products and fee initiatives and expectations regarding business developments and acquisitions. They are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore, you should not put undue reliance upon them. These results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K and on our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available on our website and at www.sec.gov.
  With that out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay. Jim, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our third quarter earnings call. Upfront here, I'll plan to cover 3 subjects. First, I'll provide my perspective on our Q3 results and outlook for Q4. Second, I'll share our continued progress on our Beyond initiative. And lastly, I'll update you on the acquisition front.
  Okay. So on to Q3. We reported Q3 revenue of $681 million, up 10%, and $3.10 in cash EPS, up 16%. On a constant macro and constant scope basis, or what we call like-for-like basis, revenue was up 11% and cash EPS up approximately 17%. So right in line with our targets.
  Overall, organic revenue growth was 11% in Q3, with fuel card organic revenue growth finishing at 10% in the quarter. Our global fuel card revenue represented about 42% of our overall consolidated Q3 revenue. Our 3 nonfuel lines of business performed quite well, with lodging and toll revenue both up 17% and corporate pay revenue up 24%. The volume growth, quite strong in all 3 nonfuel lines of business. In lodging, our SMB room nights were up 10%. In toll, our active tags, up 8%. In corporate pay, our virtual card spend, up 14%. So healthy volume growth in each business.
  Our trends in the quarter, also quite good. Our new sales or new bookings, up 14% versus the prior year, and once again, we signed up over 30,000 new business accounts to our various programs. That represents over $100 million of new annualized recurring revenue, so real demand for our offerings.
  Same-store sales rebounded quite nicely into the plus column, plus 1%. Inside of that number, various puts and takes. Our trucking business, quite soft really everywhere, here in the U.S., in the U.K. and even in Brazil. That was offset by strength in our Mexico and Russia fuel card business and within our corporate payments business.
  Our client or business retention continued quite steady at 92%, so obviously, pleased with that. Our balance sheet, in a very good place. Leverage finished below 2x, and we now have approximately $1.3 billion available on our revolver, so well positioned to allocate capital to buybacks and/or acquisitions. And given the -- some recent weakness with tech IPOs, maybe valuations will come down.
  So in summary, Q3, another clean, solid quarter. Organic revenue growth, 11%; profit growth, 16%; strong volume growth on our 3 nonfuel businesses; continued positive sales, retention and same-store sales trends; and lastly, Q3 profits finishing at the top of our guidance range.
  Okay. Let me make a turn to our outlook for Q4. We're confirming overall organic revenue growth guidance of 9% to 11% for Q4, with fuel card organic revenue growth in the 7% to 9% range. That's on tougher comps. We're raising full year 2019 cash EPS guidance to $11.73 at the midpoint. That reflects our $0.05 Q3 beat to guidance.
  Just as a reminder, our initial 2019 full year guidance from February was $11.55. The assumptions within our updated rest of year guidance versus the last time we spoke, slightly less favorable macro primarily due to FX weakness in Brazil. But that will be offset by a higher acquisition contribution, the TA deal which closed on October 1.
  Okay. Let me transition to an update of our Beyond strategy initiatives. Just as a reminder, our Beyond strategy idea is really twofold: first, to offer our existing clients the opportunity to spend more with us by expanding the network in which they can make purchases; and then second, to attract new customers and/or new customer segments to which our expanded network appeals, so for example, offering urban or city drivers in Brazil the option of using our RFID parking and fueling sites in the city.
  So let's start off with Beyond fuel here in the U.S. Another good quarter. We activated approximately 1,500 new Beyond fuel clients in Q3. That's out of roughly 100,000 existing U.S. fuel card clients that we're targeting. These companion card clients, those that purchase both fuel and nonfuel, spend about 50% more and generate 25% more revenue per account than pure U.S. fuel clients.
  In addition, 20% of all new Q3 fuel card sales in the U.S. were to Beyond fuel or 2 for clients, those choosing the option to purchase nonfuel items in addition to fuel.
  Moving on to Beyond toll. In Brazil, Q3 continued further adoption of our 5 million existing toll users there. The fuel transactions grew nicely, up 60% in Q3 versus the prior year. The McDonald's transactions, crazy, reached 460,000 in the quarter, up sequentially from Q2, and we estimate on track now to reach 3 million next year in 2020. But maybe more importantly is the impact of Beyond toll in attracting these new urban or city users. So the new urban sticker users added in Q3 was 58,000. That's up from 3,500 in Q1 and 18,000 in Q2. So the idea of attracting some of the potential 20 million Brazil city drivers to our Beyond toll offering is starting to materialize.
  Okay. In our corporate payments business, historically, we've relied on the virtual card as our primary go-to-market offering. But now with the recent Nvoicepay acquisition, we plan to broaden our go-to-market approach with 4 offerings. So one will be plastics, offering simple P-Card programs as an initial entrée in the accounts payable space; two, virtual cards for clients who want to digitize some but not all of their payables; third, full AP for clients who want to transform their entire AP process and make 100% of their payables electronic; and then lastly, cross-border payments for clients who have some international payments, who want a simple and integrated way to make those payments from the same user interface.
  In Q3, about 14% of our overall payables revenue, excluding cross-border, was from full AP, so up from a fraction earlier in the year. So we expect this 4-prong payables product line to dramatically strengthen our market position as we move into 2020.
  So to us, the Beyond strategy initiative is now working on both fronts. It's increasing the spend and revenue that we get from existing fuel, toll and virtual card clients. And maybe more importantly, the Beyond offer is attracting new types, new kinds of clients to our programs. Again, as I said, 20% of all new U.S. fuel card clients sold in Q3 with the Beyond offer and 20% of all new Brazil tag users in Q3 to the Beyond toll offer. So starting to become material.
  Okay. Last up is acquisitions. We're delighted to announce the acquisition of Travelliance in early October. This is one of the deals we mentioned on our last call that was closed in, and we're pleased to have completed that deal. TA broadens our existing lodging business into the airline segments, cruise, distressed passengers, even the airline personnel. And because it's global, it adds international hotel coverage and feet on the street capabilities. This reflects our strategy of entering adjacent lodging segments, so in this case, airlines. But there's others like corporate apartments or corporate meetings that could expand the TAM of our hotel line of business.
  We paid about $120 million for TA, annualized revenue approximately $50 million, with 20% EBITDA margins. Looking for TA to be accretive in 2020.
  In terms of pipeline, still quite active. Currently, we're working 4 or 5 tuck-in opportunities in our fuel, lodging and corporate pay spaces. And as I mentioned earlier, plenty of liquidity to pursue them.
  So in closing, we had a very good Q3, double-digit revenue and profit growth and continued good trends. Q4 outlook is maintained despite the less favorable FX in Brazil. Our Beyond strategy, gaining more traction. We're capturing additional spend from existing clients and again, extending the TAM and the new prospect base for our services. We continue to close tuck-in deals and have additional opportunities in the works.
  So with that, let me turn the call back over to Eric to provide some additional details on the quarter. Eric? 
Eric R. Dey: Thank you, Ron. For the third quarter of 2019, we reported revenue of $681 million, up 10% compared to $619.6 million in the third quarter of 2018. GAAP net income increased 43% to $225.8 million from $157.7 million, and GAAP net income per diluted share increased 46% to $2.49 from $1.71 in the third quarter of 2018. As a reminder, included in the third quarter of 2018 results was a $23 million true-up charge to income taxes related to the transition tax liability originally recorded at the end of 2017 in connection with the U.S. tax reform, which reduced the GAAP net income and GAAP net income per diluted share in the quarter.
  Non-GAAP financial metrics that we'll be discussing are adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share, for which the reconciliation to GAAP numbers is provided in Exhibit 1 of our press release. Adjusted net income for the third quarter of 2019 increased 14% to $280.6 million compared to $246.6 million in the same period last year. And adjusted net income per diluted share increased 16% to $3.10 compared with $2.68 in adjusted net income per diluted share in the third quarter of 2018.
  Third quarter results reflect a negative year-over-year impact from the macroeconomic environment of approximately $7 million in revenue. The macro impact was primarily due to lower foreign exchange rates when compared with the third quarter of 2018, which we believe negatively impacted revenue by approximately $7 million due primarily to unfavorable foreign exchange rates in Brazil and the U.K.
  Fuel prices were also slightly worse year-over-year in the third quarter. And although we cannot precisely calculate the impact of these changes, we believe it negatively impacted revenue by approximately $3 million in the quarter. This negative impact was partially offset by a $3 million favorable impact in fuel spreads.
  Organic revenue growth after adjusting out the impact of the macroeconomic environment and the Chevron deconversion was approximately 11% for the third quarter of 2019, and all major product categories performed well during the quarter. Organic growth in our fuel card business was 10%, excluding the deconversion of the Chevron portfolio driven by solid growth in most of our fuel card businesses. And our Beyond fuel initiative contributed about 1 to 2 points of growth during the third quarter.
  The corporate payments category continues to perform well and was up 24% organically during the quarter. The growth in corporate payments was driven by both our cross-border business, which grew in excess of 30% again in the quarter and our Comdata Corporate Payments business, which grew in the upper teens. Both our toll business and our lodging business were up 17% organically. So all in all, another very good quarter for our nonfuel businesses, resulting in very strong organic growth performance in the quarter.
  Same-store sales also improved sequentially from a decrease of approximately 1% in the second quarter, to an increase of approximately 1% in the third quarter. There are a lot of puts and takes between our businesses around the world. But generally, our Mexico and Russia fuel card businesses and our corporate payments businesses were strong in the quarter. That was partially offset by our trucking business in the U.S., in the U.K. and Brazil that were a bit soft in the quarter.
  Now moving down the income statement. Total operating expenses were up 4% percent for the third quarter of 2019 to $351.9 million compared with $338.5 million in the third quarter of 2018. The increase was primarily due to acquisitions and normal growth in our operations. As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses were approximately 51.7% compared to 54.6% in the third quarter of 2018. Included in operating expenses are credit losses of $15 million for the third quarter or 5 basis points versus $17 million or 6 basis points in the third quarter of 2018.
  As expected, we've begun to see the reduction in losses as a result of some new AI tools and processes we put in place earlier this year. And we continue to expect more improvement as the fuel stations implement EMV card terminals through 2020. Depreciation and amortization expense was flat at $67.3 million in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $67.3 million in the third quarter of 2018.
  Interest expense increased 1% to $36.5 million compared to $36.1 million in the third quarter of 2018. The increase in interest expense was due primarily to the impact of acquisitions closed in 2019 and higher LIBOR rates compared with last year.
  Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2019 was 22.9% compared to 33.6% for the third quarter of 2018. The 2018 third quarter tax rate included a $23 million true-up of our provisional transition tax liability originally recorded at the end of 2017 in connection with U.S. tax reform. If we exclude the impact of the transitional tax adjustment, the tax rate for the third quarter of 2018 would have been 23.4%.
  Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1,470,000,000 in total cash. Approximately $412 million is restricted and consists primarily of customer deposits. As of September 30, 2019, we had about $3.5 billion outstanding on our term loans and revolver and approximately $1,285,000,000 of undrawn availability. We also had $992 million borrowed in our securitization facility at the end of the quarter.
  In the third quarter of 2019, we repurchased approximately 184,000 shares of our stock for $55 million, and we have $489 million remaining under our current authorization. The Board has authorized an additional $1 billion increase in the share buyback authorization, and we now have nearly $1.5 billion in total capacity. As of September 30, 2019, our leverage ratio was 1.98x EBITDA as calculated under our credit agreement, which is well below our covenant level of 4x EBITDA. Given our leverage ratio and current liquidity, we believe we have ample dry powder to pursue both our M&A objectives and share buybacks. We intend to use our future excess cash flow to temporarily pay down the balance on our revolving credit facility and securitization facility and maintain liquidity for acquisitions and other corporate purposes. And as a reminder though, our first use of liquidity will continue to be M&A. Finally, we spent approximately $16.7 million on CapEx during the third quarter of 2019.
  Now on to the update for 2019. First, we are raising our adjusted net income per diluted share guidance by $0.05 to $11.73 at the midpoint to reflect our third quarter results compared to our expectations. As always, we expect a few moving parts in our balance of the year guidance. For the balance of the year, we expect the macro impact to be approximately $10 million worse than our prior guidance due primarily to lower fuel prices and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. However, the impact of the Travelliance acquisition will offset the impact of the unfavorable macro. So taken in total, these puts and takes net to 0 in terms of financial impact for the fourth quarter.
  Please refer to our third quarter earnings call supplement for additional information regarding our guidance.
  So with that out of the way, our guidance is as follows: total revenues to be between $2,640,000,000 and $2,660,000,000; GAAP net income to be between $880 million and $900 million; GAAP net income per diluted share to be between $9.80 and $9.90; adjusted net income to be between $1,050,000,000 and $1,070,000,000; and adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $11.68 and $11.78.
  And some of the assumptions we have made in preparing the guidance includes the following: weighted fuel prices equal to $2.73 per gallon average in the U.S. for the fourth quarter; market spreads well below the fourth quarter of 2018 average; foreign exchange rates equal to the month of September 2019 average; interest expense of $150 million to $155 million for the full year; approximately $90.3 million fully diluted shares outstanding for 2019; and adjusted tax rate of approximately 23% for the full year; and no impact related to acquisitions or material new partnership agreements not already disclosed.
  And with that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Ron, thanks for the comments on the M&A pipeline. I'm just curious if there are any larger-sized deal that you're interested in the market in the pipeline. And then specifically, the Travelliance, could you maybe just walk through the synergy pieces there? 
Ronald F. Clarke: What's larger, Sanjay, to you? 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Not a bolt-on, more transformative. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. So I would say of the list in front of me, we have 2 out of the 5 things we're working on, where the number would start with a b, with a billion. So I don't know if you call those large, but they're more than tuck-ins. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: And when we think about the probability of that type of deal happening sooner than later, I mean, is it the valuations are still quite high? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, the valuations are, I think we said a million times, for us, it's really the conviction around the forward numbers. And so in those cases, we are working to see if we can get the conviction to have forward numbers where we can make returns. So I'd say those deals that are bigger are earlier than some of the other things we're looking at. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Okay. Great. And then as far as the Travelliance sort of synergies that you might be able to extract, could you just maybe talk through sort of time frame and the thesis there? And then just a quick question on gift. The -- I know it's a smaller part of the total, but the weakness there in terms of revenues, could you just talk about what's driving that? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Let me start with TA. So at the headline level, I'd say that our early view is we'll double the profits of that business in 2020, and I'd say the 2 key synergies are, first, the hotel arbitrage. So we share, I think, about 8,000 hotels that we have in common. And we have much larger volumes in a lot of those hotels and so we have better rates. So we'll pick up arbitrage based on our rate versus TA's. And then second, I'd say the whole back office. Like we got a lodging business that's got a decent back office around finance, HR and IT, and so we got a bunch of synergies planned on the back office. So those 2 things will drive the doubling of profits next year. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Great. And the weak -- gift... 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Gift is really just timing. As you know, the -- one of our least favorite things about that business is the seasonality and the bumpiness of orders. There's a number of pretty large clients, and they make orders of significant size. So sometimes, those orders come in, in a quarter or get pushed. And so in this case, fundamentally, we're moving forward into Q4 some of the revenue we expected in Q3. 
Operator: Our next question is from Trevor Williams with Jefferies. 
Trevor Williams: One for me on Beyond fuel. Ron, I appreciate the color on the Q3 uptake, and I'll just ask first my questions upfront. So first, do you mind reminding us what percentage of the 100,000 U.S. fuel customers that you guys had marketed the program to? And then second, I was just curious more on the trend that you've seen from the Q1 and Q2 cohorts. I know you guys have said in the past you've seen an average initial uplift in spend around 40%. But I was just hoping you could give us some color around how that growth has trended in the quarters that follow. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay. Good -- both good questions. So of the 100,000 kind of credit-worthy targets, I think we're in the about 2/3, call it, 65,000 that we've marketed to kind of year-to-date that we keep adding 10,000 or 20,000 every quarter to target. I think we're up to an attach rate in the 6,000 to 7,000 clients now. Two, the book in total is spending about 50% more. That 7,000 out of the 100,000 that are going Beyond fuel and buying nonfuel spend, about 50% more with us, which trends at about 25% more revenue. But the hope, the idea that we're working now is whether the nonfuel spend could be dramatically higher, multiples of 5 or 10x what the fuel spend is. And really, we limited it, artificially going in by creating credit lines and credit limits proportionate to fuel rather than credit limits proportional to the clients' ability to repay. So we're actually in tests now with a subset of those 7,000 accounts, increasing the credit line and seeing if we can expand the nonfuel spend by again multiples of 5 or 10x.
  So the early view of that is positive, but I'd say that could drive the 2020 success really as much as they continue to saturate. 
Operator: Our next question is from Bob Napoli with William Blair. 
Robert Napoli: The corporate payments business, Ron, is -- you had a 30% revenue growth, and your revenue per transaction was up quite a bit. I think your -- you lapped the Nvoicepay acquisition in the first quarter. But what is the outlook for that? What do you expect for that business? Now I generally think of the accounts payable piece to be a big market but lower revenue per transaction. Your revenue per transaction was up 20% year-over-year. So just some thoughts on that business, on maybe the mix of revenues, cross-border versus virtual card and the long-term growth in how AP fits into that. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Bob. I mean as you know, it's a great line of business with a huge TAM. That Nvoicepay deal, I believe, closed April 1, so we're not close yet to lapping that. And frankly, all the components, all the offerings there, Nvoicepay with full AP, our core virtual card business, our plastics business and particularly, our cross-border, all of them are growing really well year-to-date, 2019.
  I think, again, our plan for that business, although not baked, is to try to guide that stuff still into the mid-teens, which again, for us, is really a function of, like I say all the time, sales investments relevant to the base because the base keeps getting bigger, which it does. We have to modulate up our sales investment to keep that base growing 15%. So we kind of design or engineer our way. If we thought we could invest a bit more and not have too many new people or too many new marketing programs, we might try to step it up some. But we want to maintain quality, right, in terms of the onboarding and the client service that we're trying to, I don't want to say, do it in a controlled way, but effectively grow the business in a controlled way. 
Robert Napoli: Where are the risks? There's a lot of investment going into that market and a lot of innovation. Where do you have -- where are you most paying attention to the competitive front? And where could it affect your business? And... 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I think I've said this before. We love the breadth now of our game. There are people fighting at it. Niche, right? There are some pure, full AP players. There's obviously some pure plastics players. There's banks that are subcontracting, virtual card processing. So the first thing I'd say is I like the fact that we've got a broader solution set than most of the others that play in the game. And then second, I say it over and over again, it's a distribution game, right? These are relatively new services and require education and communication. And so having the sales force that can go out and communicate and brief prospective accounts, I think, is still our main advantage. And then third is because we get out earlier than other people, our merchant network and the quality of the data and the ability to fulfill payments, the high degree of accuracy is a huge part of the game. So those advantages, I think, bode well. It's not that there are other people chasing, but we really like how we're set up. 
Operator: Our next question is from Ryan Cary with Bank of America. 
Ryan Cary: We heard WEX call it a weaker demand environment in the quarter, particularly in the fleet business. And while I know you called out some headwinds in U.S. trucking, it doesn't sound like the headwinds that you're seeing are quite as meaningful. So first, are you modeling any slowdown in demand in the fuel business as compared to your prior expectations? And second is there anything you can provide on-demand trends quarter to date? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Ryan. Hey, it's Ron. So you got it right. I'd say in terms of our same-store base, I think, globally, we reported a plus 1% back into the plus column. And I did call out trucking soft here, in the U.K. and Brazil. I'd say other than that, the trends look relatively consistent for us year-to-date through the first 3 quarters. I think year-to-date, we had a, I can't remember, a 0, a minus 1% and a plus 1%, so it's kind of flat on same-store through the first 3 quarters. And I think, last year, we did a bit better. We were plus 1% or 2%. But no, I wouldn't say, per your WEX comment, that we're seeing other than the trucking callout, anything different than what we've seen. 
Ryan Cary: Got it. And then just moving to the toll side. It's interesting to hear how Beyond toll has driven the acceleration in new urban sticker users. How has that growth impacted merchant imbalances? Is there anything stopping you from meaningfully expanding the acceptance footprint? And what does it take for the merchant themselves to kind of introduce the payment capability of accepting one of the toll tags? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean frankly, I think we're a bit blown away by the pace. I don't know if you picked up the numbers from my opening remarks. But we turned and basically went after these urban users who are not obviously heavy toll users, right? But they're a huge group. And to go from focusing on one channel, we started in the gas station channel, trying to add these people, added 3,500, stepped that up to 18,000. And when I saw the number for Q3 that we had gotten to 58,000, and they're out looking again another 50,000 at quarter -- this quarter, I mean, the distribution channels, we've opened up more of our traditional store, retail, digital channels to now target these urban people. So that's what's causing a significant step-up.
  You're right. It is a chicken and an egg. The bigger the network that we can offer urban people, the more attractive our offer is, right? If we had fueling station twice as many parking, twice as many fast-food, that would be even more appealing. But I think we've obviously got enough is what the data tells me to attract people. And so we're going to chicken and egg it. We're going to keep trying to add urban users to generate revenue. We're going to keep expanding each one of those 3 networks, which we have over the last couple of years. And so I think again as you look into the midterm in that network, it's more built out. Our returns will get better, right? We'll be spending less money building out the network and obviously, more money, hopefully, turning the crank.
  In terms of digits and stuff, I'd say the fueling challenge is higher than the parking or the fast-food. The nature of having multiple lanes and the vehicles moving and the way the equipment and stuff sets up is a bit more complex in that gas station environment. So it's not particularly difficult at stationary, like the fast-food, where it then comes through one line, one lane the whole way. So tougher in fuel and easier in parking and fast-food.
  And clearly, as I've said before, there are additional merchants in every one of those areas now interested in joining the program. So once we show people are coming to Shell, then the other fuel guys want to be in. And once we show them McDonald's is working, the other fast-food people want to come in. Once we sign up the next-biggest parking operator, then we get calls for the next set of parking operators. Once we get the first rental car company in, in line, now the other rental car companies are calling. So once you prove out that your client base will go to those merchants, you attract yet more merchants. So it's really, I keep telling you, guys, it's a great model. The question is really just the pace at which we can do it. 
Operator: Our next question is from Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. 
Ashish Sabadra: Congrats. Congrats on such a solid quarter. Particularly if I'm going to exclude the gift card, the growth was even stronger. Just one question on the corporate payments side. So I was wondering if you could share what the bookings growth was there. And then thanks for classifying out that -- how big the full AP is. I was just wondering if you could share some -- what's driving the growth and like how you're going to market in the full AP solution space, how -- what kind of traction you're seeing on cross-sell as well as new wins and how you're using the data or existing relationship to sell more into that customer base. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Ashish, it's Ron. Were you looking for the sales in corporate pay? Is that what your first question was? 
Ashish Sabadra: Yes. It's the bookings -- yes, bookings growth in corporate pay or sales bookings growth in corporate pay. 
Eric R. Dey: You guys have that? Do you find it anywhere? Hold on, we're just taking a peek for it. 
Ashish Sabadra: I can get that off-line. I was just more interested in how you're driving new sales and what learnings you've had and how we can see that -- this potential same process actually going forward. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean the marketing, I'd say, is evolving, right? So we had a number of separate pieces. As I mentioned earlier, the core Comdata business, Ashish, we owned 5 years ago, pushed basically plastics, P-Cards and virtual cards. And obviously, Nvoicepay had been, 10, 15 years, building itself up as a full AP provider. And obviously, Cambridge, we bought, whatever, 2 years ago, has been a cross-border specialist. And so I'd say the main change we're going through is trying to integrate that package and that marketing message so that we can take the power of having lots of ways to help a company, a corporation, make payments and make them aware of all the different programs that we've got. They want to start super simple, we can compete with P-Card guys. They want to get rid of their paper, we can give them a virtual card. They want to transform. So I'd say that the integration and the consolidation is the biggest change.
  With that said, we still have field specialists behind each one of those products. So we have people that are obviously super trained in virtual cards, super trained in full AP and super trained in cross-border. And so what we're trying to figure out is the account manager lead, if you will, and the marketing lead that provides the consolidated set of solutions and then still have specialists that can go deep in terms of presenting our particular solution. So that's what's going on now. We're trying to make a turn from effectively peddling one program, one service at a time, to marketing something more comprehensive.
  And I think when we do that, if we do that, the returns will be way better and bigger because you can generate more interest from a prospect, right, offering a broader set of solutions for them. 
Ashish Sabadra: Yes. No, that's helpful. And maybe just a preliminary look at next year going into 2020, is this kind of accelerated 9% to 11% organic growth sustainable just given that you'll be hearing some difficult comps going into next year? And the same thing on fuel cards, any thoughts how we think about the growth there? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. It's still early days for us for 2020, where, in fact, we had a couple of budget reviews today and yesterday. So I'd say we're in the middle, Ashish, of our 2020 planning. I guess what I would say is that we go into this every year with the same aspiration, which is to build plans across these businesses that can hit the goals that we've set out, which are kind of 10% and 13%, and then using our free cash flow and capital to produce profits to the 15% to 20% range. And so what I'd tell you is that Eric and I are coming in, trying to build plans, making trade-offs that can hopefully stay on that same track, but it would be, I think, premature because we don't have the stuff consolidated to really give you any other guidance. I mean obviously, Eric, we'll be back in 90 days, correct? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes. I agree, Ashish. So I mean, we are, we're kind of right in the middle of a process and we'll have, obviously, a lot more to say when we get to the Q4 earnings call. 
Ronald F. Clarke: But remember, Ashish, which you know well, the beautiful thing about this business is the recurring model. And so if you have a good '19, it helps you already have a good '20. So just to repark that in your guy's mind that the modeling that we do is based off of exit rates. And if you look at our 4 quarters stacked up, you'll see sequential acceleration obviously in revenues right in our business. So obviously assuming our trends, like retention which we quoted, stay in line, that obviously creates built-in growth as we roll into next year. 
Operator: Our next question is from John Davis with Raymond James. 
John Davis: I just wanted to follow up a little bit on the same-store sales commentary, Ron. I think you called out U.S. trucking softness. It sounds like the good guy this quarter was corporate payments. Any insights to macro trends just from that business and what you're seeing the business' macro, slightly better, getting slightly worse, any insights there would be helpful. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I think the magic in the payables or corporate payments business is in the model. Again, it's not so much if the clients are healthier or not than in fuel cards. If you went into a client, let's say, that had 1,000 invoices and we went in and paid 20% of them, we paid 200 of them, first of all, their number of invoices and expenses tend to grow every year, and then second, our share, the 20%, can grow. So effectively, the model, if you will, is built to grow, to step up, if you will, quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. So I'd say that's the difference, if you will, between the fuel card business where they've got to go from 10 drivers, to 11. Their revenues have to go up. They have to decide if they're going to spend more on drivers and stuff. And so I think the model just lends itself, if you will, to a bit better same-store sales. And as the mix of that business is growing a bit faster, so as that becomes a bigger part of our mix, it obviously helps our overall consolidated same-store number.
  But again, I think we feel comfortable. We're happy with plus 1%. It's pretty balanced other than the trucking callout. And per earlier, we don't really see anything even through October here that's any different than what we have experienced kind of year-to-date. 
John Davis: Okay. And then just a -- that's helpful. Just a quick follow-up on M&A landscape and specifically kind of around corporate payments. Appreciate your comments about valuations. We'll see what the impact is there. First thing that came to mind for me is maybe some of these high-flying B2B payment companies, maybe you're having a little bit of a reality check with what's going in the public markets. So are there any specific capabilities or geographies that you view is attractive or kind of top of the list as you look at M&A opportunities and corporate payments? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean again, the good news is we kind of have a lot, again, of the products that we now have, a full AP, even though there are other people that do that. We have virtual card processing, even though there's a few people that do that. We have a merchant network. So we have a lot of the capabilities. I'd say we're always on the lookout for either complementary market segments or verticals. So for example, we've got a pretty big position in construction. I think it's 1/4 or 1/3 of our corporate payments business. So if there were another company that had 1/3 in media or 1/3, I was going to say in health care, but no thanks for health care, 1/3 in something else, 1/3 in property management, some other kind of complementary vertical, we would like that, or b, some of it has some different kind of selling capacity. It's found some way to crack digital selling, for example, or just figured out some kind of a new partner channel, those would be, I think, the couple of things that we would look for.
  Again, this -- the core AP business is most attractive here at old, good, old U.S.A. because we're the world's slowest in getting off the paper as you know, still kind of have paper. The rest of the planet seems to have done a better job than us. So I'd say that, for now, most of our focus is still on targets in that corporate pay segment that are U.S.-based. 
Operator: Our next question is from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. 
Jennifer Dugan: It's Jenny Dugan on for Andrew. Just thinking about the macro impact on fuel. Is it a -- is the headwind more from pricing, or is it miles driven? What metrics should we be watching there? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Ask that Jenny one more time. Is the headwind... 
Jennifer Dugan: Is the headwind coming more from pricing or for miles driven? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I don't think it's from pricing. I think it's softness in the, just in the channel of trucking, right, the loads, the capacity, the drivers, just what they're delivering. And then second is what you're saying, is it's vehicle or fuel efficiency. Those would be the couple of things creating the slowdown. 
Jennifer Dugan: Okay. And then do you anticipate us getting to a point soon where it's going to start hitting -- like loss rates will go up and start hitting segment profitability? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Loss rates in what, in the trucking business? 
Jennifer Dugan: Yes. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Our loss rates are -- in that business are low single digit. And I'd say at least half of whatever we lose there is credit, is us exiting some more challenged kind of trucking companies for credit. So I don't think so. I mean even though the thing has slowed, it's clearly a necessary U.S. way of delivering. And so I think it -- maybe it could continue to slow, and the vehicle efficiency is probably a point or 2 drag as we roll forward. But no, I don't -- we don't see anything in the numbers that suggests a spike in attrition. 
Eric R. Dey: Yes. Hey, Jenny, also to add onto that, from a loss perspective, I mean, we have lots of tools that we've implemented over the last couple of years that helps us to kind of manage credit losses and manage the creditworthiness of the accounts. And we tend to manage our losses through lots of different things, including payment terms. So think of accounts that would be probably less creditworthy would have more frequent payment terms and less days to pay because we want to manage the amount of our credit exposure through that. So we're constantly looking at it and evolving the way we build those type of accounts. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. 
Damian Wille: It's Damian on for Ramsey. I'm just hoping to take a step back here on the B2B business. Obviously, Visa and MasterCard are intensifying their focus on B2B payments. Just I want to get your take on how that changes the dynamic in your business, presumably better at sort of rising tide, lifts all shifts. But then maybe then you could break out the growth rates of the various products or channels within corporate payments. For example, I'm assuming the partner channel is probably growing a little bit faster than the direct, given the fast growth of some of the AP automation startups. But I just want to get your take on those couple of things. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Damian, hey, it's Ron. So I would say yes to the first point, to have Visa and MasterCard be big fans of this corporate payments or B2B space. It's great. I mean I think it helps both PR and marketing and awareness and stuff. So I think it certainly softens the beaches as we go out. And they're just obviously both super helpful to us, both in research, and they're working on some products and some ways to hopefully make us more effective in it. So I'd say that that's all good.
  In terms of the components, yes, I'd say that the reason the channel thing can grow faster is there's 2 things going on. One is the channel partners that we already have are pouring more money in. So take Abbott, who's been a client of ours for a while, they're continuing to ramp up sales and marketing spending. So they grow. And then b, we had new channel partners. And so in the direct business, we mostly just do the second thing, right? We had new clients that we don't have. But in the channel business, for example, we brought on Bill.com as a partner, and they're beginning to ramp up. So we -- it's a 2 for power of they invest more and grow and then we find new partners in the channel space. 
Damian Wille: Yes. That's great. And then just separately here on the lodging business, you guys rolled out the new network of hotels for the "gray-collared workers." Maybe if you could just give an update on that and maybe if it helps revenue per trend. And then I'll just slip in the sort of perennial question on gifts, just if there's any update on strategic alternatives there. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. That's an interesting one. I think it's been less impactful with the existing base than we thought. So when we first launched, and I think we got a 2% or 3% percent lift in room nights as clients saw, hey, hey, there's a bunch more places I can go. What I think it is, is existing people kind of go -- existing accounts go to where they went. They're harder to switch or change where they're going. I think where maybe it's helping more is on the selling side, attracting new people and having a larger hotel coverage and network to attract people so they feel like if they join the program, they got plenty of coverage. So we thought, initially, it was going to help more with the base, but I think the answer is it's probably going to help more with new accounts. 
Operator: Our next question is from David Togut with Evercore. 
David Togut: I apologize if you called this out earlier. But did you give the growth rate on the MasterCard fuel card in the quarter? 
Ronald F. Clarke: I don't know. Did we, Eric, or not? 
Eric R. Dey: I don't think we did, David. I think we've given just the total of it. But I don't have it right in front of me, but we can circle back to you on this. 
David Togut: Okay. As a follow-up, where do you stand in terms of building out the cross-border corporate pay capability connecting domestic corporate pay through the Nvoicepay acquisition to Cambridge? That seems to be where a lot of the world of payments is focused and you've got some unique assets there. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. We've -- again, as I mentioned earlier, we're doing that stitching, David, now, right, that it's funny that Nvoicepay and even Bill.com, both full AP guys, had reached out to Cambridge even before we had done the Cambridge transaction, trying to have capability for the, whatever, the 4% or 5% of cross-border payments that those client bases have. So they were already trying to integrate it even before we did.
  So I'd say it's still early days. We're trying to figure out how to speak to both clients we have that are only on one of those products or prospects that may be interested across all 3 or 4 of those products and yet keep some specialization, people that really know the particular area well. So I'd say it's a work in process. But I think it's a huge advantage for us, right, to have all the different ways to be able to help an AP department versus going in with just one. But I'd say, I think next year, we'll probably be in a better place to articulate how we're going to do it. 
David Togut: Got it. Just a quick final one for me. Any update on the growth at AllStar in the U.K.? And are you completely done with the shift to chip cards there? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. We're done with the shift to chip cards. I'd say that we're still pushing the Beyond fuel. Like of all the markets who are in the fuel cards, I'd say the U.K. is the most mature, right? We have the highest market share as a company, not only with AllStar, but the other product lines we have there. So I think for that thing to continue to be a decent grower in the midterm, we've got to get the Beyond fuel numbers up. So that thing is improving. I'd say not going as well yet as the U.S. There are some subtleties there. But I'd say that's still our best idea for leveraging. It's a very big client base that we've got in the U.K., so getting them to spend more with us seems like the easiest way to step up growth there. 
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer session and today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines. Thank you for participating, and have a pleasant day.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-08-06 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the FLEETCOR Technologies Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
 I would like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Jim Eglseder, Head of Investor Relations for FLEETCOR Technologies. Thank you. You may begin, sir. 
James Eglseder: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our second quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today are Ron Clarke, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Dey, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Ron and Eric, the operator will announce an opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. It is only then that the queue will open for questions.
 Our earnings release and supplement can be found under the Investor Relations section of our website at fleetcor.com. Throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. 
 This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than non-GAAP information at other companies. Quantitative reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today's press release and on our website, as previously described. We are also providing updated 2019 guidance on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis along with reconciliations.
 Finally, before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements. This includes forward-looking statements about our guidance and outlook, new products and fee initiatives and expectations regarding business development and acquisitions. They are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore, you should not put undue reliance upon them. 
 These results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K and on our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available on our website and at SEC.gov.
 With that out of the way, I would like to turn the call over the Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay. Jim, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our second quarter earnings call. Upfront here, I plan to cover 4 subjects: first, I'll provide my perspective on our Q2 results; second, I'll preview our outlook for the second half; third, I'll report a bit on the continued progress of our beyond strategy; and lastly, I'll comment on the acquisition front.
 Okay. So on to Q2. We reported Q2 revenue of $647 million, up 11%, and $285 million in cash EPS, also up 11%. On a constant macro and constant scope basis, or what we call like-for-like basis, revenue was up 13% and cash EPS approximately up 13%. Both revenue and cash EPS results topped our expectations, revenue coming in about $7 million better than planned and cash EPS $0.06 higher than the midpoint of our guidance range. 
 Notably, our overall organic revenue growth accelerated nicely to 13% in Q2. That marks the highest organic revenue growth quarter since we started reporting like-for-like revenue in 2016. So we're quite pleased.
 Inside of that, our fuel card organic revenue growth was 9%. Our 3 nonfuel lines of business, all exceptional: lodging up 13%; toll up 17%, corporate pay up 26%. The volume growth in each of those 3 nonfuel lines of business, quite good. In lodging, our SMB room nights were up 15%. In toll, our active tags, which drive revenue, up 7%. And in corporate pay, our virtual card spend, up 20%. So very strong volume growth.
 Our trends in the quarter continued quite good. Our new sales or new bookings, up 18% versus prior year. Our client or business retention continued steady at 92%. Our same-store sales came in at minus 1% but largely due to softness among the large retailers in our gift segment. Excluding gift, same store would have been a push.
 Our balance sheet, in a very good place. Q2 leverage finished about 2x, and our July term loan upsizing of $700 million brings our revolver liquidity now to over $1 billion. So we're well positioned to allocate capital to either acquisitions or buybacks in the second half.
 So in summary, Q2, probably one of the best quarters in quite some time. Record organic revenue growth of 13%. Very strong volume growth in our 3 nonfuel businesses. Continued positive sales growth and retention trends. And Q2 profits above the top of our guidance range.
 Okay. Let me transition to our outlook for the second half. So today, we're confirming overall revenue growth guidance of 9% to 11% rest of year and fuel card organic revenue growth in that same range. We're raising full year 2019 cash EPS guidance to $11.68 at the midpoint. That reflects our $0.06 Q2 beat to guidance.
 There are a number of assumptions or kind of moving parts rest of year. We're expecting a bit more unfavorable macro than when we spoke last time and a slightly higher share count than when we spoke last time. But those will be offset by lower interest expense going forward and likely better acquisition contribution driven by the SOLE deal going forward. So look, when you take all these items together, they effectively net to 0 in terms of rest of year impact.
 Also as a reminder, our rest of year guidance anticipates pretty big increases sequentially in both revenues and profits.
 Okay. Let me transition over to an update of our beyond strategy. As a reminder, the idea, quite simple: to offer our existing fuel, lodging and toll clients the opportunity to spend more with us by opening up the network or adding locations in which they can purchase things. This increases the utility of our card programs to our clients and results in incremental spend and revenues for us.
 So beyond fuel, here in the U.S., we added 2,000 new beyond fuel clients in Q2. That brings our active beyond fuel client count to about 6,700. This set of beyond fuel clients contributed approximately 1% to 2% of our incremental revenue growth in the quarter. So starting to be helpful. 
 Still lots to do. We're targeting about half of the 100,000 eligible existing fuel clients and continue to monitor credit trends quite carefully. But it seems clear to us that our fuel card clients do like the idea of making adjacent mobility and supplier purchases on a single business account with us.
 Lodging. In our beyond lodging initiative, we added about 10,000 new hotel locations to our 15,000 proprietary network a couple of months ago. And in June, we captured about 3% of our overall room nights coming from the expanded network. So based on our forecast, we're hopeful that the expanded network could add about 2% of incremental revenue growth to our SMB lodging business by year-end.
 In terms of beyond toll, our Brazil initiative, we've now nearly tripled our parking, gas station and drive-through network from about 1,000 locations at the time of acquisition in 2016 to over 2,700 locations today. 
 And the adoption in the expanded network is growing. At McDonald's, for instance, we had 65,000 transactions in March. That grew to 135,000 transactions in June, and we're expecting approximately 250,000 McDonald's transactions as we exit December. So a big pickup.
 Very importantly, sales of our new nontoll, or what we call urban users, are also growing. We added approximately 18,000 new urban user tags in Q2. That's up significantly from 3,500 that we signed in Q1. So the conclusion is our beyond strategy is gaining traction. Adoption's accelerating, and the new revenue contribution in every business, growing.
 Okay. Last up is acquisitions. I'll touch on the 2 transactions that we recently closed, Nvoicepay and SOLE, and also provide a brief update on our acquisition pipeline. So Nvoicepay, we were delighted to announce that acquisition on our last earnings call. The primary rationale again for that deal, strengthen our position in full IP, or integrated payables, in which we help clients pay 100% of their monthly supplier invoices. And that's via every payment modality: card, ACH, even paper check. 
 So we've made good progress in the first 90 days that we've owned Nvoicepay. We've advanced the synergies that we outlined at close, and we expect Nvoicepay the transition from approximately $0.03 dilutive in Q2 to accretive in Q4.
 SOLE, we closed the SOLE Payroll Card acquisition on July 1. SOLE is a payroll card tuck-in. It's about 1/4 the size of our existing payroll card business and has historically grown revenue about 30% annually. So we like it as an add-on for a couple reasons. First, it's complementary to our existing business in that it focuses on SMB accounts. And it's developed a pretty ratable partner distribution channel with payroll processors to sell more or further penetrate that SMB segment. 
 And then second, we expect significant synergies via the combination as we consolidate our tech platform and our existing bank and network relationships. So expect SOLE to be accretive in 2020.
 In terms of pipeline, our acquisition pipeline, still active. We've got 3 close tuck-in opportunities, one each in our fuel, lodging and corporate pay businesses. And as I mentioned earlier, we've got plenty of liquidity to pursue them.
 So in closing, again, a very good Q2 with revenues and profits ahead of our expectations. Our rest of year outlook is good. We're planning sequential step-ups in revenues and profits. Our beyond strategy is starting to take hold. Client adoption, accelerating. And the revenue contribution, becoming more meaningful. 
 The integration of our 2 recent acquisitions, also progressing nicely. We're capturing synergies and expect both of those deals to be accretive to 2020 earnings.
 So with that, let me turn the call back over to Eric to provide some additional details on the quarter. Eric? 
Eric R. Dey: Thank you, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. For the second quarter of 2019, we reported revenue of $647.1 million, up 11% compared to $585 million in the second quarter of 2018. GAAP net income increased 48% to $261.7 million from $176.9 million. And GAAP net income per diluted share increased 52% to $2.90 from $1.91 in the second quarter of 2018. Both of these reported numbers include the impact of a tax benefit associated with the sale of our Masternaut investment, which was a benefit to GAAP net income of $65 million and GAAP net income per diluted share of $0.72 per share. 
 The sale of our investment in Masternaut allowed the company to offset the capital loss recognized against the previously recorded capital gain from the sale of NexTraq in the third quarter of 2017.
 Non-GAAP financial metrics that we'll be discussing are adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share, for which the reconciliation to GAAP numbers is provided in Exhibit 1 of our press release. Adjusted net income for the second quarter of 2019 increased 8% to $256.7 million compared to $237.8 million in the same period last year. And adjusted net income per diluted share increased 11% to $2.85 compared to $2.57 in adjusted net income per diluted share in the second quarter of 2018.
 Second quarter results reflected negative year-over-year impact from the macroeconomic environment of approximately $10 million in revenue, in line with our expectations. The negative macro impact was primarily due to lower foreign exchange rates when compared with the second quarter of 2018, which we believe negatively impacted revenue by approximately $17 million due primarily to unfavorable rates in Brazil and the U.K. 
 Fuel prices were slightly better year-over-year in the second quarter, and although we cannot precisely calculate the impact of these changes, we believe it was a positive $1 million to the quarter. And finally, fuel spreads had about a $6 million favorable impact in the quarter.
 Organic revenue growth after adjusting out the impact of the macroeconomic environment and the Chevron deconversion was approximately 13% for the second quarter of 2019, and all major product categories performed well during the quarter. 
 Organic growth in our fuel card business was 9%, driven by solid growth in most of our fuel card businesses. Our beyond fuel initiatives contributed about 2 points of growth. The corporate payments category continues to perform well and was up 26% organically during the quarter. The growth in corporate payments was driven by both our cross-border business, which grew in excess of 30% in the quarter, and our virtual card business, which grew approximately 20%. 
 Our toll business was up 17% organically, driven primarily by new toll tag sales, rate initiatives and more beyond toll revenue. Our lodging business was up 13% on a print basis and would have been up approximately 16% if you adjust out the roughly $1 million in emergency-related revenue from the second quarter of 2018. So all in all, another very good quarter for our nonfuel business, resulting in very strong organic growth performance in the quarter.
 Now moving down the income statement. Total operating expenses were up 9.2% for the second quarter of 2019 to $349.8 million compared with $320.2 million in the second quarter of 2018. The increase was primarily due to acquisitions and normal growth in our operations.
 As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses were approximately 54.1% compared to 54.7% in the second quarter of 2018. Included in operating expenses are credit losses of $18 million for the second quarter of 2019 or 7 basis points compared to $14.5 million or 6 basis points in the second quarter of 2018. 
 The higher-than-normal credit losses were due primarily to fraud losses in our U.S. fuel card businesses. Fuel card fraud should improve as U.S. fuel stations begin transitioning to chip and PIN technology in late 2019 and 2020.
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 3% to $70.9 million in the second quarter of 2019 from $68.6 million in the second quarter of 2018. The increase was primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2019. Interest expense increased 19% to $39.5 million compared to $33.2 million in the second quarter of 2018. The increase in interest expense was due primarily to the impact of additional borrowing for share buybacks throughout 2018, recent acquisitions and increases in LIBOR. 
 Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2019 was a negative 1.7% compared to 23.5% for the second quarter of 2018. And if you adjust out the tax benefit related to the sale of Masternaut, our effective tax rate would have been 23.6%.
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.49 billion in total cash. Approximately $318 million is restricted and consists primarily of customer deposits. As of June 30, 2019, we had $3.614 billion outstanding on our term loans and revolver and approximately $478 million in undrawn availability. We also had $974 million borrowed in our securitization facility at the end of the quarter. 
 Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we completed a $700 million upsizing of our Term A loan facility. We will initially use the additional funds to pay down the revolving credit facility and securitization facility. And we now have approximately $1.2 billion in availability. We plan to use these funds for acquisitions or future share repurchases of our stock.
 As of June 30, 2019, our leverage ratio was 2.1x EBITDA, which is well below our covenant level of 4x EBITDA as calculated under our credit agreement. We intend to use our future excess cash flow to temporarily pay down the balance on our revolving credit facility and securitization facility and maintain liquidity for acquisitions and other corporate purposes. Finally, we spent approximately $17.5 million in CapEx during the second quarter of 2019.
 Now onto the update for the outlook for 2019. First, we are raising our full year revenue guidance $20 million at the midpoint to reflect our second quarter outperformance and the acquisition of SOLE Financial, which closed in early July. We are also raising our GAAP net income and GAAP net income per diluted share guidance to reflect our second quarter beat and the impact of the Masternaut-related tax benefit in the quarter in addition to the acquisition of SOLE Financial. 
 We are also raising our adjusted net income per diluted share guidance by $0.06 to $11.68 at the midpoint to reflect our second quarter results compared to our expectations.
 Also, we expect a few moving parts in our balance of the year guidance. For the balance of the year, we expect the macro impact to be slightly worse than our prior guidance due primarily to lower fuel prices and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. We also expect a slightly higher share count due primarily to an increase in our share price, which impacts the calculation of fully diluted shares. Partially offsetting these impacts will be favorable interest expense due primarily to interest planning initiatives implemented and lower LIBOR rates and the impact of acquisitions, which will be slightly accretive over the balance of the year.
 So taken in total, these puts and takes net to 0 in terms of financial impact on our balance of the year guidance. Please refer to our second quarter earnings call supplement for additional information regarding our guidance.
 So with that out of the way, our guidance is as follows: total revenues to be between $2.625 billion and $2.675 billion; net income to be between $865 million and $895 million; net income per diluted share to be between $9.60 and $9.90; adjusted net income to be between $1.04 billion and $1.07 billion; and adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $11.53 and $11.83.
 Some of the assumptions we have made in preparing the guidance includes the following: weighted fuel prices equal to $2.75 per gallon average in the U.S. for the balance of the year for those businesses sensitive to the movement in the retail price of fuel; market spread slightly below the 2018 average; foreign exchange rates equal to the 7-day average as of July 28, 2019; interest expense of between $150 million to $160 million; approximately 90.3 million fully diluted shares outstanding; a tax rate of 23% to 24%; and no impact related to acquisitions or material new partnership agreements not already disclosed.
 And finally, for the third quarter of 2019, we are expecting adjusted net income per diluted share to be in the range of $3 to $3.10.
 And with that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. 
David Togut: With 13% organic revenue growth for Q2 and with your 2019 guide staying at 9% to 11%, is that just conservatism? Or are you expecting some deceleration in organic revenue growth in the back half of the year? 
Eric R. Dey: Dave, this is Eric. Yes. I mean, it's a couple of things. One, obviously, we expect our businesses to continue to perform, actually accelerate as we get into the second half. It's more like we have tougher comps. So last year in the second half of the year, our businesses accelerated as well. So we're expecting again accelerated growth overall but then just tougher comps from an organic growth perspective. 
Ronald F. Clarke: David, it's Ron. We've also got the gift [ in ] the other, which we don't call out, looking those to be not super great in the second half. So probably still double digits for the nonfuel lines, in that 9% to 11% number. 
David Togut: Got it. And then any specific assumptions on corporate payments in the back half? It seems like you're just starting to benefit from the cross-border growth there, up 30%. 
Eric R. Dey: Yes. They could probably still start with the 2 in Q3 and 4. 
David Togut: Got it. And then what was the growth rate for the MasterCard fuel card in the second quarter? 
Eric R. Dey: Hold on one second. We're looking it up, Dave. I think it was in the low 20 percentage, if I... 
Ronald F. Clarke: No. It was still up pretty high. So Dave, we'll look at that... 
Eric R. Dey: The combo, Dave, we call it our local business. I'm looking at the local business. It was up 13 for Q2, which includes our Fuelman business and MasterCard. I don't have the split in front of me, but it's circa, in that range. 
David Togut: Got it. And just a quick final question. The 18% growth in new sales bookings in the second quarter, any key drivers of that acceleration from what we saw in Q1? 
Ronald F. Clarke: I mean all -- I'm looking at the sales page. All look pretty good. The corporate payments again was blockbuster. It was up almost 40% over prior year. And the Brazil, I think I mentioned the new sales channels there that we launched 2 or 3 years ago were just rocking again. So that's just way, way up. So I'd say those are the 2 pulling the rest. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: So with the revenue accelerating, and Ron, like you said, sort of high since you started reporting that organic metric, I'm curious if you can attribute that to anything. It seems like you're hitting on a lot of the right areas. 
 Is it fair to just say it's greater focus across the broader organization with new sales up, retention up, organic growth accelerating? Just what would you point it to, if you want to stay there? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I think it's a good question, Tien-Tsin. I'd say a couple things. One is it's mix obviously. So having bigger businesses here that have bigger TAMs makes the nonfuel lines grow. And then second, to your point, we have had, starting with me, more focus on the knitting because we've done less big deals right in the last 12 to 24 months. So I think both of those things have brought more focus in today's business. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Cool. Good to know. And then on the bookings front, and I know David just asked it, I'm curious, how much of the bookings could we assign to your beyond initiatives? You're at 2% now. Do you have a target for maybe exit rate? Could that get much better? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. We don't actually book-keep our sales or new bookings per se into the beyond buckets yet. It's a bit of a manual kind of system. But I'd say again, the hope is for those things to step up, call it another point over the next, call it, 2 quarters. So they're building, like I mentioned, in the beyond fuel. We're still chasing the first 50,000 clients here. We're up to just under 7,000. We're going to turn our attention to the other 50 as we start to move through the second half. So stay tuned. Hopefully, more, same on the beyond tolls, same on the beyond lodging. So it's definitely picking up. I tried to give a few stats of that progress. But clearly, as those bases keep getting bigger, it should contribute more. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Okay. That's useful. And last one, just quickly on payroll. I think going back to your roots a little bit there, Ron, I'm just curious, is that a bigger focus potentially for the company? Or is it really just enhancing your corporate payments outlook? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, it might be. We like that space, because again, it's another employee payment product. We're not in payroll processing a la ADP, and there's a number of kind of independent assets given all this consolidation. So a lot of us has been keyed a bit into that. There may be some assets that could get loose here. 
 But we like it. I mean this one we pulled the trigger on, we liked it because it's really 100% SMB, which we like, Tien-Tsin. And it's got a sales model to work with processors, payroll processors. So we like the idea of building that payroll card business more in the SMB space than in the mid or large. So we just liked it a lot, and we could afford it really because of the synergies that we could bring being in the business. So it's a nice little add-on that helps us head in a direction that we like. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. 
James Schneider: I was wondering if you could maybe throw a little bit more statistical color on the progress for beyond fuel. I believe you said it was 2 points incremental last quarter. I think this quarter, you said it was 1 to 2 points. 
 Can you give us any kind of sense about -- in terms of the acceptance of the clients that are taking you up on the offer, the uplift on spend relative to kind of the 40% metrics you provided last quarter? And just to confirm that additional point or so of acceleration, is that kind of a statement about exiting this year or more of a statement about 2020? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes. Jim, this is Eric. We continue to add more customers to the base of the beyond fuel bucket. So I guess as an example, if you remember from last call, I think we said we had about 5,000 clients that were actually in that beyond -- using the beyond fuel capability. We've accelerated the acceptance to about 7,000 clients at the end of Q2. And again, we're still looking at accelerating the acceptance of that to about 100,000 customers eventually. So we're slowly getting to do that. 
 So I think as we get into 2020, you'll see that beyond fuel category accelerate by another point or so. At least that's our goal at this point. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Jim, it's Ron, just to add to it. So when we use the term beyond fuel, I think we mentioned before that there's different use cases that we kind of stick under that umbrella. So for example, we call internally the companion card, when we go back to fuel card clients we already have and try to add a card, right, that would let them buy AP. We have a different thing when we try to go to like a construction vertical and sell a twofer product, one that buys fuel and construction supplies. And we even have a third use case when we go out to trucking clients and have the trucking company put the payroll of the driver literally on the card and then use it as debit card.
 So every one of those use cases creates incremental spend by the client, incremental utility for the client, obviously, incremental revenue. And so the lift-off amount, the 40% I referenced in the last call, they vary, if you will, by those applications. So the companion card probably is in the 25% range, the construction card is probably 50% or 60%, and the payroll card probably in that 40% range. So it varies basically by use case.
 But the message I think we're trying to leave everybody with is it's working, right? We're adding clients. We're keeping clients. Each one of the use cases is building. And so to Eric's point, there's a lot of comparison to the prior period. But I think the headline is that this idea is now working. And it's growing, and it's actually adding, like we're saying, a couple of points to growth. And my comment was as you get into, call it, Q1 of next year, we should think about it going up another point. 
James Schneider: That's great color. And then maybe you can comment on the overall corporate payments side of things and particularly the sales activity you're saying there and maybe comment specifically on the kind of sales and lead generation you're seeing through some of your partners, software channels versus the Nvoicepay channel itself and maybe just kind of talk about whether you see the opportunity. Or do you have the desire to kind of acquire additional software assets in that space? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean I think they're all working. Our own direct business, we're getting much better I think on the marketing side. So we're teeing up more softball, more leagues. So that's one of the reasons our direct business is growing. 
 I think our channel partners, some of the ones that you guys know that are private are really doing super. They're investing lots of money in their respective channels. So we're getting the benefit of their growth. Same thing in our FX business. We doubled down on the sales investment and went after larger accounts. So we're seeing that now in our sales numbers that even if the account -- the new account count is the same, the dollars per account are way up.
 So I'd say that the corporate pay selling machine is working almost across the board. And in this model that we have of working with ERPs, which is part of the whole Nvoicepay pay idea there, their core business, levers the old ADP accounting stuff, car dealers and a couple of big construction packages. And so this idea of working with ERP partners in an integrated fashion to serve our joint clients is working quite well. So it's literally, Jim, across the board, the selling is working there. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. 
Robert Napoli: A follow-up on the corporate payments business. The Nvoicepay, Ron, I guess, knowing you, not that surprised that Nvoicepay is going to be accretive sooner than you thought at the end of the year. But it is -- to me, it seems like that opportunity is so large. Should it be accretive by the end of the year? I mean are -- the AP automation piece, how big of that be? And are you investing to the level that you should be to drive that business to much -- multiples of what it currently is? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. So I would say, Bob, don't presume that the version from dilutive to accretive is based on flipping sales or marketing or even IT investments. It's not. We're actually spending more as we move into the second half. It's simple, [ lay down ] synergies around contracts, for example, that they have and merchant acceleration. We can take our 500,000 or 600,000 merchants and get their card penetration up. It's easy low-hanging fruit money that we're grabbing more than it is that we're trying to govern or dial back on the investment. So that's point one.
 Point two is, [ yes ], really of all the areas, I mean, the TAM and try to monetize this payable turning AP, which is again half of the business spend, into something that's cardable or we can get it per tran fee if it's ACH or something. It's -- you know this. The opportunity is massive. So you shouldn't read any comments about accretion into what's not understanding that or us not investing a lot in that. 
Robert Napoli: Then you mentioned 3 acquisitions that are, I guess, in the pipeline that are obviously not guaranteed to close. But are they -- I mean on the M&A side, should we expect larger transactions? Or I mean how are you -- do you have visibility on -- do you expect some of those deals to close, I guess, before the end of the year? Or would you be buying back stock? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Again, when we tried to comment on our pipeline, there's a number of dimensions, right? There's the size of the deal. There's the timing. Are they now or later? There's the categories that we're in. So we're trying to just provide a little bit of flavor around the near-in things, things where we sign term sheets to where we're way along or far along in them.
 So my comment on the pipeline is we have 3, what I would call, closed-in things that will either kind of close in the next 90 days probably or not that are in the tuck-in kind of size, hundreds of millions of dollars, not $1 billion, not $50 million. 
 And then as always, we have some larger transformational things that we're exploring that are not as near in. So the headline is we've done a couple, like 3, Eric, I guess, year-to-date, kind of 3. 
Eric R. Dey: Yes, 3 tuck-ins. 
Ronald F. Clarke: I would think you should think that probably 1 or 2 more of those kind of things would happen in the second half. And as you know, given our leverage ratio and enhanced liquidity, we're obviously in a good spot to go after something larger. So we're getting to a place we've had time to focus on the knitting and the basic business, and we're in a game that tries to buy businesses and improve them. So you should expect that we're continuing to try to do that. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. 
Ramsey El-Assal: I wanted to ask about the beyond tolls performance in Brazil. I mean the statistic you threw about the McDonald's effectively were really impressive. 
 In that subsegment of that offering, just sort of the drive-thru QSR business, how should we think about the addressable market there? I mean those are incredibly impressive results of McDonald's. How unique is McDonald's as a partner in that market? And is this the type of thing where we can think of over time that you had multiple merchants like McDonald's ramping like that? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Ramsey, it's Ron. I think you're thinking about it the right way. So the press that we've had on this idea is, hey, we've got this 5 million users and parking and fueling and drive-thru are obviously merchants that are pretty interested in our customer base. 
 And so I think of it as this first 3 years that we've owned the thing has been fundamentally piloting. We've added whatever I mentioned, a couple thousand incremental locations of parking, fueling and McDonald's. And not shockingly, there's more people lined up in every one of those categories.
 So in parking, we signed up the next biggest parking operator and I think we've added 3 or 4 more. And in fueling, we've added [ Carrefour ]. And in drive-thru, we've got 2 more things that are teed up that have decent kind of drive-through footprints. We've even signed a thing, which we haven't announced, but we've signed with Nissan where we're going to factory install the stickers in all their new vehicles. And as soon as we sign that and start to talk about it, we now have other manufacturers there reaching out on the same idea.
 So I think this proof of concept, when you can relay what's happening in a gas station or at a McDonald's to the next set of drive-thru people is the key to get nothing built. So we're trying to give you the message that it's really early, but it is -- again, it's working and we expect to keep rolling the thing out. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Great. That's terrific. I wanted to ask a completely separate question about -- there's been a lot movement in the industry in terms of alternative networks. You've got the Fed announcement. You've got MasterCard and Visa both moving into kind of alternative rails. Obviously, all the mega merchants are talking about kind of on-us type of capabilities meaning FIS and Fiserv and potentially even global payments to some degree. You've alluded in the past that there might be some capabilities that you have in terms of the assets that you possess to run alternative kind of network path, maybe particularly on the corporate payments side. 
 Can you comment on your kind of most updated thinking along those lines? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I think we said this from the beginning that we want to get merchants digital. And so when we sign up a business and they've got 1,000 merchants to pay, and we realize that only 200 of those are cardable, let's say, on the MasterCard network, we scratch our heads a bit and say, okay, what could we do to digitize some of the other 800? 
 So this idea of what we call internally ACH-plus or creating some rails that provide some incremental data to merchants and maybe some earlier funding and stuff to merchants is something that we're exploring. We've built a bit of a network.
 And I think what we said is it's a land grab, Ramsey, now. So we're mostly focused on signing up clients and getting the first 200 merchants cardable. But you should think about us over time and particularly with the Nvoicepay going back and trying to digitize with our own network more of those merchants that are really unserved by Visa or MasterCard. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Oscar Turner with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. 
Oscar Turner: My question's on fuel. Are the beyond fuel-related cards typically replacing other cards? And then just wondering if you're seeing existing beyond fuel customers shift more spend to those cards over time. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Oscar, it's Ron. So on the first part of the question, it's no. So generally, we simply toggle open the cards. So we have parameters, control parameters on the card programs. So if you're a boss and you want us to open up 5 of your 10 employee cards to buy construction supplies, we can flip a switch and open up 5 of them and keep the other 5 locked down. Or b, we can give you a new card for your AP head to use to put AP purchases and leave the same 10 cards that are out in the field. 
 So the answer is we tend not to replace the cards. We either "open them up" or add new cards. 
Oscar Turner: Okay. And just as far as the -- are you seeing existing customers shift more spend? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. That's, I think, the comment earlier. The different use cases we have. We're picking up anywhere from 25% to 50% incremental spend with the account as they buy or put payroll on and put construction supplies and put AP. So the total amount of business that we're doing with the client is growing in the 25% to 50% range. 
Oscar Turner: Okay. That's helpful. A follow-up is just on -- I guess a high-level question about growth and margins just given some of the longer-term initiatives you're working towards. Do you think any of those initiatives are attractive enough, like maybe it's beyond fuel or tolls, that you would think about stepping up the marketing spend significantly? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean I think it's a really good question. So let me give kind of a 2-part answer to this. The first one is, if anything, the guidance that Eric gave for the second half anticipates a faster profit growth. So if you look at our first half print, I think our cash EPS print was 9, and I think our macro adjusted print, [ profit ] print was 13. We expect in the guidance that Eric gave you, $11.68, both of those numbers to go up. I think our print output is 13%, which is a step-up in our macro-neutral cash EPS growth of 17. 
 So the first headline is that sitting inside the guidance we gave you, there's an implied acceleration in our profits and our margins. That's point one.
 Point two, would we spend more if we thought we could sell more? The answer is yes, we would inside of a couple constraints: one, try and deliver some profit growth; and number two, the practicality of how we could spend the money and how productive the incremental money can be. We're not interested in just spending money, and obviously not producing anything. And so some forms of our marketing investment you can push a button on like search words and e-mails and things like that and then other ones that are people-intensive like telesales or field take longer to build. You can't just hire 100 brand-new people in a quarter.
 So I think the answer is it still will probably be somewhere in between. Every year, we step up our sales and marketing investment. We stepped it up faster in corporate pay. And to the extent that we can get this AP thing going better, I think we'll continue to step it up. But again, we won't go overboard, I guess, is my message. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Cary with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Ryan Cary: I wanted to ask on the toll business. When we look at the 17% organic growth in the quarter, is there a way to parse out the contribution from the legacy toll business versus contribution from beyond toll initiatives? While obviously beyond toll is still early, I'm just trying to get a sense if it is large enough to move the needle. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Can you repeat the question again? Sorry, you kind of broke up on us. 
Ryan Cary: Yes. I'm just trying to get a sense if all of these -- all these great momentum behind beyond toll, if the growth rate there is large enough to move the needle for overall toll organic revenue growth, and if it's not, when we could potentially see it kind of be large enough to be a needle-mover. 
Eric R. Dey: Yes. I mean, we're stepping up our investment continuously in the beyond toll category, as Ron indicated earlier. I mean we now have over -- I think over 1 million people that have toll tags that can actually use those cards to buy other things like fuel as an example. And we're also marketing that product to people that are using the toll product as an other than toll- first sort of thing, meaning they want to buy fuel but they don't really spend a lot on -- in the toll roads and they want to buy fast food, and they want to buy parking. So we've got a different universe of customers.
 And as Ron indicated, we're starting to partner with some major -- with a major car brand, Nissan, who's starting to install the toll tags directly into the vehicle as it's manufactured, which is obviously going to be a boon for us as well. 
 So yes, we're going to start seeing some accelerated growth as acceptance increases over time and as our investment in sales and marketing steps up over time. So we're going to -- starting to sell to more customers. So we're very bullish on the prospects for the beyond toll category. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Ryan, it's Ron. I'd just add to what Eric said. And I'd say if you said, hey, in Q2, it's probably less than 1%, and the reason again simplistically is the company there has really 100% of all the toll locations, been around, whatever, 15, 20 years. It covers every -- primarily every tollbooth in the land, and yet we don't have every parking, obviously every gas station or every drive-thru. We have tiny percentage of gas stations and drive-thrus.
 So I think the question earlier today is the right way to think about it, which is this is almost a pilot period where we're showing that these other networks can matter and can get used and are liked by the clients. And as those build and we get larger percentages of drive-thru restaurants and gas stations, that, that growth rate will have -- will become obviously way more material.
 So I'd say this thing will be a bit slower build because we've got to kind of build the network whereas in beyond fuel we have the MasterCard network, right, it can go up a bit faster because the network's already there. We just have to get clients to spend on it. This one is we're actually a network builder, which I hope everyone gets, is a super sustainable thing once you get it up. And it creates a great barrier to other people trying to kind of copy us. Hey, I have your dad's toll company now. I'm glad you have that built because we built that plus these 5 things. 
 And so that's the game. We're in a race to build a way more interesting network to these mobility people. 
Ryan Cary: Got it. And then switching to kind of the corporate payments side of the business. Clearly, growth of both Comdata and Cambridge were very strong in the third quarter. Was there any contribution to the growth rate of either from Nvoicepay, which I believe is either integrated into both or is in the process of being integrated? Or is this more of the strong performance of the stand-alone assets? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Well, that thing grew like a weed. I mean the problem is it's small, right? So against the other 2 businesses you talked about, it's tiny. But on the front end, I think it grew 50% or 100%. So it's as a standalone business, and obviously, we've got way more selling capability to help it. So that thing is growing both top and bottom quickly. It was already growing quickly, by the way, before we bought it, but it's growing faster now. But I'd say most of the headline numbers we're quoting you are coming from the 2 core things that you called out just because they're bigger. 
Ryan Cary: Got it. But I know you're integrating Nvoicepay. It wasn't like due to integration that caused the growth rates to which expand or accelerate, prior to the Comdata or Cambridge assets? 
Ronald F. Clarke: No. Some of it is. It is both. Again, I think we told you that there's some things we've done like on the merchant side and some things we've done with our ERP people and the sales rates. So we put a number of things in already. 
 The thing has moved from, like I said, the minus 3 to flat to plus 2 over the course of sequential quarter. So it's moving quite nicely top and bottom. It's just not driving the overall 26% number that we quoted. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Christiansen with Citibank. 
Peter Christiansen: Nice outperformance, guys. I have 2 questions. First, Ron, you talked quite a bit the last couple of quarters about shifting a lot of marketing towards digital. I just wanted to see if you have an update on what kind of productivity or efficiency gains that you're seeing on that front. And could you extend that strategy onto some of the beyond initiatives as well? 
Ronald F. Clarke: That's a great question, Peter, yes. Inside of our sales results, which were up 18%, we had another record global digital contribution. I think digital has now, in the U.S., surpassed 40%. I think it's 42% to 44% of all our new sales in the U.S. are coming digital. And then b, we started to crunch the digital thing into seamless applications that the whole process becomes digital. So I'd say that we're still early in it, but between enabling digital outreach and then digital applications as well as the science around the landing pages or the click-through, I think that our sophistication in B2B digital is up dramatically over the last 2, 3 years. And I'd say there's still way -- to your question, way more room to go. 
 And I think we're still trying to sort how we can invest more in that because unlike the people thing, you can step on that faster and still keep it productive. So getting better, more sophisticated. It's producing more, but I think there's still more runway there. 
Peter Christiansen: That's helpful. And then there's been some negative press lately, I guess, on some of the truckers, particularly in the shipping side. Just wondering what you guys are seeing on your OTR. And any pockets of weakness there? That would be helpful. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. It's for sure soft. I'd say we saw some of it in Q1. I'd say we saw more of it here in Q2 and partly because we have the beyond fuel initiative, what we call OnRoad initiative there. It helped our revenue growth in that segment. But I think the underlying same-store sales in our trucking business has actually gone negative. 
 I quoted 1% same-store negative globally for our business or call it a push, call it a 0. If you take out our gift card business inside of that, I think our trucking was, call it, minus 1 or minus 2. So we're seeing really the same kind of softness that the industry is. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that's all the time we have for questions. And this ends the call. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-05-07 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the FLEETCOR Technologies First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Jim Eglseder, Head of Investor Relations for FLEETCOR Technologies. Thank you. You may begin. 
James Eglseder: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. By now, you should have access to our first quarter press release and supplement, which can be found under the Investor Relations section on our website at fleetcor.com. 
 Throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than non-GAAP information at other companies. 
 Quantitative reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today's press release and on our website as previously described. Also, we are providing updated 2019 guidance on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis with reconciliations.
 Finally, before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements. This includes forward-looking statements about our guidance and outlook, new products and fee initiatives, and expectations regarding business development and acquisitions. They are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore, you should not put undue reliance upon them. 
 These results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K and on our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available on our website and at sec.gov.
 With that out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay, Jim. Thanks. We appreciate everyone taking the time to join us this afternoon. Up front here, I'll plan to cover 3 subjects. First, I'll provide my perspective on Q1 results. Second, I'll preview our outlook for rest of year. And third, I'll provide a bit of an update on our major growth initiatives. 
 Okay. So on to the quarter. We reported Q1 revenue of $622 million, up 6%, and $2.67 in cash EPS, up 7%. On a constant macro or like-for-like basis, revenue was up 11% and cash EPS up 13%. Both revenue and profitability in the quarter topped our internal expectations, revenue about $10 million better than planned, and cash EPS $0.07 higher than the midpoint of our guidance range.
 Organic growth, overall, 11% for Q1 with all 4 lines of business performing well. Fuel card revenue growth finished at 10%; toll growth, 15%; corporate pay revenue growth, 18%; and lodging revenue growth, 6%, although 18% if you exclude the FEMA impact from Q1 last year. So look, good performance from each of our business lines.
 Our trends also quite good in the quarter. Customer retention of 92%; our same-store sales, flat, down 1 point from the last 2 quarters; and new sales or new bookings up 12% versus last year with particular strength in our corporate pay and Brazil business. So look, all in all, a good start to the year, revenue and profits out ahead of expectations, 11% overall organic growth and solid trends. So out of the blocks quite nicely.
 Okay. Let me transition to our rest-of-year outlook. So first off, the macro. We expect they're pretty consistent with our initial '19 guidance. There are a few puts and takes from 90 days ago, clearly, better fuel prices and lower interest rates but significantly worse FX rates. So when you put it all together, basically comes out where we thought at the beginning of the year. In terms of revenue, our organic revenue growth expectation remains 9% to 11% range rest of the year, and our fuel card organic growth in the same 9% to 11% range. 
 On the earnings front, we're raising full year 2019 cash EPS guidance to $11.62 at the midpoint. That reflects our $0.07 guidance beat in Q1. To note here, included in our $11.62 full year cash EPS guidance is $0.13 of new headwind, really coming from 2 areas: first, an unexpected higher share count rest of year, about 1 million to 1.5 million additional shares more than planned. That's because of our higher stock price along with a few cents of dilution related to our invoice pay acquisition. So effectively, we baked a bit better performance into our rest-of-year outlook to absorb this $0.13 unplanned headwind. So net-net, we're outlooking 2019 to come in incrementally better than our expectations starting out the year.
 Okay. Lastly, let me transition over to an update, a progress with our 4 major growth initiatives. So initiative 1, beyond fuel, where we open up fuel cards in a controlled manner to allow our cardholders to make additional business purchases, obviously, ones that are authorized by their employer. So now in the U.S., we have 5,000 of our active fuel card clients actually making beyond fuel purchases. This is resulting in about a 40% lift in per-client revenue. And so as '19 rolls on, we'll plan to make this beyond fuel offer to more than 100,000 additional U.S. fuel card clients also to some of our new sales prospects. So we'll keep you posted on our take rate and expected impact on revenue growth.
 Second up is our beyond toll initiative in Brazil. So here, we're trying to do 2 things: first, encourage our 5 million active toll users to use their account with us to also make additional fueling, parking and fast-food purchases; and then second, we're trying to attract nontoll users or what we call urban users to join our fuel, parking and fast-food program. 
 So the report here is good. We are -- we're gaining some traction. At McDonald's, we now have 200 stores live and have gone from 0 transactions to 65,000 in the month of March alone so lots of excitement from McDonald's. We've also sold 4,000 new nontoll user accounts. That's at 30 gas stations in the quarter. So just starting the marketing and sales rollout there. So from our perspective, an encouraging start, and it supports the view that there is real demand for this expanded beyond-toll network.
 Third up is lodging. The growth idea there is simple: to increase the number of accepting hotels in our network from approximately 15,000 to 25,000 and thus capture some additional room nights from our existing customer base. So pleased to report that extended network is now live. Website is now live, and we've actually begun to book new room nights in that extended network. So again, expectation is that this increased site acceptance will generate incremental lodging revenue per client. 
 So last up is our initiative or growth plan for our corporate payments business. So simply put, we want to make 2 offers to the marketplace. So offer 1, which is what we do today, is to provide card payments for general AP that reduce paper and provide client rebates and savings. And offer #2 is to automate and simplify 100% of the client AP file so a client can literally pay 100% of all their invoices electronically. 
 So our first offer, which is our card payments approach, it's obviously working well. We reported that it's growing mid-teens in the quarter, so clear that the market likes that offer. 
 And to accelerate the implementation of our second offer or full AP outsourcing offer, we acquired Nvoicepay in Q1. So Nvoicepay is a leader in cloud-based AP software that lets companies pay, again, 100% of their invoices electronically. They pay all the clients, merchants, whether that's via card, ACH or even paper. 
 So for us, the Nvoicepay deal, it's quite additive. It increases our TAM. Given its appeal to the SMB market, it increases our merchant network now to over 1 million supplier relationships, and it gives us, really, just an incredibly comprehensive offer to take to the market. So note that we are clearly committed to building a big B2B payables payments business.
 So look, in closing, back to the top, we're delighted with our Q1 results and start to the year. Again, revenues and profits ahead of plan, double-digit organic revenue growth and steady trends. We're confirming our rest-of-year outlook, confirming a 9% to 11% organic revenue growth, raising our full year cash EPS expectations. And we've also reported, we think, some real progress with our 4 major mid-term growth initiatives, all 4 now live in market, all 4 getting good reaction, all 4 increasing our revenue per client. So look, as the take rate and pace of adoption pick up throughout the year, we'll be in a better position to forecast the potential revenue acceleration. 
 So with that, let me turn the call back over to Eric to provide some additional details on the quarter. Eric? 
Eric R. Dey: Thank you, Ron. For the first quarter of 2019, we reported revenue of $621.8 million, up 6% compared to $585.5 million in the first quarter of 2018. GAAP net income decreased 2% to $172.1 million from $174.9 million. And GAAP net income per diluted share increased 3% to $1.93 from $1.88 in the first quarter of 2018. 
 Included in the first quarter results was the impact of a $15.7 million or $0.17 per diluted share impact of an impairment charge related to our investment in the telematics business. Excluding the impact of the impairment charge, net income increased 7% to $187.8 million, and net income per diluted share increased 12% to $2.10 in the first quarter of 2019.
 Non-GAAP financial metrics that we'll be discussing are adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. And the reconciliation to GAAP numbers is provided in exhibit 1 of our press release. 
 Adjusted net income for the first quarter of 2019 increased 2% to $238.4 million compared to $233.5 million in the same period last year. And adjusted net income per diluted share increased 7% to $2.67 compared to $2.50 in adjusted net income per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018.
 First quarter results reflect the negative year-over-year impact from the macroeconomic environment of approximately $23 million in revenue, in line with our guidance. The negative macro was driven mostly by lower foreign exchange rates, specifically the Brazilian real and U.K. pound, when compared with the first quarter of 2018. We believe FX negatively impacted revenue by approximately $28 million. 
 Fuel prices were basically flat year-over-year in the first quarter. And although we cannot precisely calculate the impact of these changes, we believe it was neutral to the quarter. And finally, fuel spreads had about a $5 million favorable impact in the quarter. 
 Organic revenue growth, after adjusting out the impact of the macroeconomic environment and the Chevron deconversion, was approximately 11% for the first quarter of 2019. All of our major product categories performed well during the quarter. Organic growth in our fuel card business was 10%, excluding Chevron, driven by solid growth in most of our fuel card businesses. 
 The corporate payments category continues to perform well and was up 18% organically during the quarter. The growth in corporate payments was driven by both Cambridge, which grew in excess of 20% in the quarter, and Comdata, which grew in the mid-teens. 
 Our toll business was up 15% organically, and our lodging business was up 6%. Our lodging business would have been up 18% if you adjust out the $4 million in emergency-related revenue from the first quarter of 2018. So all in all, another very good quarter for our nonfuel businesses. 
 Now moving down the income statement. Total operating expenses were up 4% for the first quarter of 2019 to $337.6 million compared with $325.4 million in the first quarter of 2018. The increase was primarily due to normal growth in our operations. As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses were approximately 54.3% compared to 55.6% in the first quarter of 2018. The decrease in operating expense as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation of approximately $2 million, the impact of foreign exchange rates on expenses and a decrease in amortization expense.
 Included in operating expenses are credit losses of $22.2 million for the first quarter or 8 basis points compared to $12 million or 5 basis points in the first quarter of 2018. As we told you in December, we expect credit losses to remain higher than normal in 2019 due primarily to higher fraud losses in our fuel card business in the U.S. We intend to decrease fraud losses in the short run by implementing more controls to limit fraud. Fuel card fraud should reduce significantly as U.S. fuel stations begin transitioning to chip and pin technology in 2020.
 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 6% to $67.4 million in the first quarter of 2019 from $71.5 million in the first quarter of 2018. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange rates on expenses and some acquisition-related intangible assets that have become fully amortized. 
 Investment loss was $15.7 million for the first quarter of 2019. The company regularly evaluates securing value of its investments and, during the first quarter of 2019, determined that the fair value of its telematics investment was impaired and recording impairment of the investment.
 Interest expense increased 26% to $39.1 million compared to $31.1 million in the first quarter of 2018. The increase in interest expense was due primarily to the impact of additional borrowing or share buybacks throughout 2018 and increases in LIBOR. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2019 was 23.3%, excluding the impact of the impairment charge, compared to 23.7% for the first quarter of 2018, in line with our expectations. 
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.373 billion in total cash. Approximately $315 million is restricted and consists primarily of customer deposits. As of March 31,2019, we had $3.554 billion outstanding on our term loans and revolver and approximately $569 million of undrawn availability. We also had $942 million borrowed in our securitization facility at the end of the quarter. 
 We purchased a minimal amount of shares in the quarter, and those purchased were associated with employee sales to cover taxes. We have approximately $548 million in repurchase capacity remaining under our current authorization. 
 As of March 31, 2019, our leverage ratio was 2.10x EBITDA, which is well below our covenant level of 4x EBITDA as calculated under our credit agreement. We intend to use our future excess cash flow to temporarily pay down the balance in our revolving credit facility and securitization facility and maintain liquidity for acquisitions and other corporate purposes. Finally, we spent approximately $15 million on CapEx during the first quarter of 2019.
 Now on to the update for our outlook for 2019. First, we are raising our full year revenue guidance $30 million at the midpoint to reflect our first quarter beat and the acquisitions closed on April 1. We're also raising our adjusted net income per diluted share guidance $0.07 to $11.62 at the midpoint to reflect our first quarter results compared to our expectations. 
 Also, we expect a few moving parts in our balance of the year guidance. We expect the macro impact for the balance of the year to be in line with our prior guidance as the impact of favorable fuel prices will be offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates. We also expect a higher share count due primarily to an increase in our share price, which impacts the calculation of fully diluted shares. 
 We also expect a slightly dilutive impact from the Nvoicepay acquisition over the balance of the year but do expect the acquisition to become accretive in 2020. We expect our businesses to continue to overperform for the balance of the year to help offset the impact of the higher share count and slightly dilutive transaction. Please refer to our first quarter earnings call supplement for additional information regarding our guidance. 
 So with that out of the way, our guidance is as follows: total revenues to be between $2.600 billion and $2.660 billion; net income to be between $800 million and $830 million; net income per diluted share to be between $8.85 and $9.15; adjusted net income to be between $1.030 billion and $1.060 billion; and adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $11.47 and $11.77. 
 Some of the assumptions we have made in preparing the guidance includes the following: weighted fuel prices equal to $2.90 per gallon average in the U.S. for the balance of the year for those businesses sensitive to the movement in the retail price of fuel; market spreads slightly below the 2018 average; foreign exchange rates equal to the 7-day average as of April 28, 2019; interest expense of $160 million; and fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately 90.1 million shares; a tax rate of 23% to 24%; and as always, no impact related to acquisitions or material new partnership agreements not already disclosed.
 For the second quarter of 2019, we are expecting adjusted net income per diluted share to be in the range of $2.74 to $2.84. The second quarter guidance includes a dilutive impact of the Nvoicepay acquisition and higher share count. Additionally, volumes should build throughout the year, and our new growth initiatives should gain momentum throughout the year, resulting in higher revenue and earnings per share in the third and fourth quarters. 
 With that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.
 The next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. 
James Schneider: I was wondering if you can maybe kind of talk about the outlook you see in corporate payments for the rest of the year. You talked about mid-teens rate. You did a little bit better than that in this quarter. Can you maybe talk about some of the factors that are -- kind of drive potential upside there, and broadly, what you think you would need to see in terms of -- is that going to be -- sorry, the acceleration potential? Is that possible? And is that going to be driven more by sales trends or any other factors you can kind of talk about driving upside or downside over the course of the year? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Jim. It's Ron. So I'd say we'd stick with the mid-teens number. As you know, in that business, it's mostly in-year function of implementation, not sales. So virtually all the revenue that we get, we sold already. So if we overperform in sales next year, you'd see that improvement, that acceleration in 2020. 
 The thing that could cause it to kind of float up or down is really if the clients we have that healthier or we grab more of their total spend, more of their file. So I'd say that's the lever, basically, that's in-year is the health of the client, the growth of the client base and then the share that we might get of their overall payables. 
James Schneider: That's helpful. And then maybe a bit of an update on your strategy on terms of B2B software. Clearly, at this point, you have both partnerships as well as now an acquisition -- or second acquisition in Nvoicepay. Can you maybe talk about your desire to kind of own more of the software for the AP side of things or the AR side of things versus partnerships? And then maybe any kind of the way you're trying to manage any potential channel conflicts across the business there. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. That's a good question. So clearly, on the partnership side, our role is really as card processor, right, for our major partners. And so this Nvoicepay and the cloud software is really for us fronting our clients, and so it's different. We got the software so that we'd have our own full AP automation software that we owned, and it doesn't really affect our ability to process for the partners that we got. And I'd say we're probably -- don't need any more short term. We've got international cross-border software capability. We've got obviously card-processing capability. And now we've got full automation and disbursement capability. So I think we've got the capabilities we now -- that we need to have a very comprehensive package, and so the game now is to take it to market. 
Operator: The next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: A quick question on the acceleration expected in the back half of this year. Could you just talk about how much that's -- of that's incorporated into the guidance and sort of what the key factors are that will either lead you to outperform or underperform? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes. Sanjay, this is Eric. I mean our volumes really build throughout the year as our sales capabilities start to kick in. So a lot of the escalation we see typically in the back of the year, which is very consistent with how we performed over many, many years, is basically just some seasonality and some of the benefit from all the sales that we've made in the first half of the year in a lot of our different product lines. So we're really expecting pretty normal step-up in growth kind of quarter-to-quarter. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Okay. And then I've got a question on the fuel segment. I'm just looking at sort of the transaction growth versus the revenue growth. And obviously, there's some noise with gas prices and the like. But how should we expect the transaction revenue -- I'm sorry, the transaction volume growth to trend over time and its relationship with revenue growth? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes. Sanjay, this is Eric again. Normally, transactions growth in the fuel sector run around 2% to 4%. We expect that business to grow in the 9% organic growth range, and it's going to be comprised of basically 3 things. One is growing transactions again in that kind of 2% to 4% range, which generally translates into a little more revenue because of mix. If you think about it, we've got different product lines all over the world. Each one of our product lines has a different revenue per transaction dynamic. So we're obviously investing in those products that deliver higher revenue per transaction. So there's a mix favorability that comes into play as well. 
 And then in addition to that, we're going to up-sell other products and services. Think of things like beyond fuel, I think Ron mentioned on the call, which contributed 1 point or 2 of organic growth. And then the remainder, generally speaking, will be a little bit of rate on the fringes to different products kind of around the world. 
 Our Q1 transaction growth was a little bit impacted by a couple of things. One, we had some -- there's 1 less business day in the first quarter versus where there was a year ago, which impacted volumes a little bit. We also had a little bit of a weather impact, particularly on the West Coast in our card lock business, which impacted some transaction volumes there as well. So a little bit of that going on in Q1, but I would say, generally speaking, think about it as kind of 2% to 4%. 
Operator: The next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. 
Ramsey El-Assal: You can hear me, right? 
Ronald F. Clarke: We can. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. Fantastic. The -- thanks for the color on the beyond tolls business. I wanted to get your sense -- maybe a little deeper sense of the penetration in the different product category there. It feels like the QSR food drive-through toll tag usage seems to be kind of inflecting in a more substantial way than fuel or private garages. First, is that a fair characterization? And then second, is there a pipeline you can speak to on the food side? If you have McDonald's, can you sign the proverbial Burger King? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Ramsey. It's Ron. I would say that we don't know. So if you take the 3 beyond toll expansions, you take parking, fuel and then fast food, so the company's been in parking the longest, quite a long time. And so the step-up there is really coming from the expansion. We're basically doubling the number of parking locations. So that one, I think, will mirror the market that -- as those doubling of locations get implemented, we'll see that parking lift probably 1 for 1. 
 On fuel, it's earlier days. It's a couple years. The company seesawed around with credit and how we would do it. So I'd say that one is still early, and we're trying to figure out really how to push that and, as importantly, sell new people onto it. 
 And then fast food is super duper new. I think our first thing went live sometime in the fourth quarter. I don't know if you picked up the call-out, but at half the locations that we're going to, 200 locations, we had 65,000 transactions in 1 month, and I heard verbally that it was quite a bit higher actually in April. 
 So to your point, I don't think we know yet of the $5 million active users we have between fuel and fast food, whether one of those is going to be more light, if you will, than the others. So we're going to keep expanding and keep promoting and keep watching the uptick and reporting back. 
 But I think the headline for today is it's working. It's super early, and we're just starting to promote this expanded network to the clients that we got, and the usage is already starting to build. So I think the feedback that we're trying to provide everybody here is we think we're heading in the right direction. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. That makes perfect sense. I wanted to ask kind of a higher-elevation question about the general kind of market penetration levels in the U.S. fleet business. This is something that you'll revisit periodically in terms of the overall market penetration. Understanding that it's a large market, it's pretty penetrated in the small market, so it's a lot less penetrated. Where do we stand now? And then also, can you just speak to your kind of growth algorithm and how it's evolved? How much of your growth is signing up net new customers versus flowing more volume into those same customers' wallets? If you could just speak to those 2 things, I'd appreciate it. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Both good questions. So on the first one, our estimates are circa $8 billion revenue opportunity based on the market size and the way we price. So we've got circa 10%, call it, of our $1.2 billion in revenue globally in fuel cards, call it, $700 million, $800 million of that here in the U.S. So we've got about 10% market share of the U.S. TAM. And so we think the other quality fuel cards, if you will, that are universal like ours are circa in that similar kind of range. So that means the other 80% are on either a lesser fuel card, call it, private label fuel card, again, cash or general-purpose credit card, what we would call not as good a method to buy. So we think that, that 80% is still right to convert to our kind of card. And obviously, that opening, if you will, is even larger as you move down market, right? It's probably closer to 90%. So the issue is not, again, runway or TAM. 
 And then on the second question, I think the key learning so far is, of the 5,000 U.S. clients that we've got across, the revenues were up 40%. And so when I say to you that I think it's incredibly meaningful to the growth rate that, if we can get an attach rate of 25% or 30% against our client base and get increases of 40% to 50%, that's going to create a lot of lift over the mid-term. So I would say that we've been talking about this thing for 2 or 3 years. We've got traction now. Clients obviously like it. And so I would say it's going to form a pretty core part. As Eric mentioned, it was 2 points of our growth -- of our 10% growth in the quarter. I could see that thing getting to 4% probably over the next couple of years. 
Operator: The next question comes from Bob Napoli with William Blair. 
Robert Napoli: The -- I just -- I mean the 40% beyond fuel per customer just seems like a pretty dramatic number. Does that, Ron, change the business model at all? Is there any more credit risk or capital requirements that go with beyond fuel? And what do you think the attach -- I mean, how much have you marketed it? And what do you feel like you can get a penetration rate on that product up to? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean the short answer is, obviously, we don't know, Bob, because it's super early days. Our internal target is to try to get that attach rate to, call it, 25% or 30%. And yes, to your point, it does come with additional capital because you're carrying incremental spend. But again, because we've already done the underwriting and seen the credit risk of the clients that we offer to, we've got a pretty good perspective, right, on the credit of those accounts. I think the one place where the opportunity is way bigger again is the circle of our clients' AP relative to the circle of our clients' fuel purchases. So we're coming out with, call it, half. We're getting half of the client's general AP versus his fuel purchase. Our guess is the general AP is 10 to 20x larger than the client's fuel purchase if you think about the expense structure of the companies. 
 And so I tell you, I think we're just literally scratching the surface of the amount of AP that we can get. And again, we're trying to offer our products in a controlled manner and only pick off certain kinds of expenses of our clients, not turn ourselves into a general-purpose card. So what I'd say to you is that the opportunity between 40% and a much higher number is something we're going to continue to work. So we don't have all the answers yet, but what I tell you is it's working. We've got lots of clients now taking the offer. We're going out to another 100,000 this year. They like it. They're spending money on it. We're making money on it. And so it's going to be incremental. And as we get clear on just how incremental, we'll revert. 
Robert Napoli: And a follow-up question. Just your leverage is still pretty low. You guys generate a lot of cash, obviously. You don't -- I mean, back half of the year, do you expect -- I know you're always working on acquisitions. Where would you expect to acquire? What areas are you most interested in adding to? And if you don't do acquisitions, will you buy back stock in the back half? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. So on the second half of the question, we're working on 3 or 4 active transactions now. They actually are in 3 of our categories. They're in fuel, lodging and corporate pay. So Eric and I are obviously looking at the likelihood of those transacting, sitting at 2x. And so as those either clear or not, we'll look harder at the buyback. I guess if we have more days like today, we'll be looking particularly hard at the buyback. 
 But clearly, we look at our liquidity position, Bob, relative to our deal flow and relative to our view of our stock price, our market price. And so if those things get out of line, like they did a year ago, we -- I think we showed we bought a lot of stock back, about $1 billion. 
 So I think you should think that our capital allocation philosophy will stay that course, really, the rest of the year. If deals don't happen and our stock drops, we'll be buying back stock. And if we buy deals and our stock goes up on this kind of performance, we'll probably buy back less stock. 
Operator: The next question comes from Oscar Turner with SunTrust. 
Oscar Turner: So first question is just on corporate payments and the Nvoicepay deal. Can you talk about the degree of integration we should expect to see there between Nvoicepay and existing corporate payments businesses? For example, is there a different go-to-market to sales teams for those 3 products, so between Nvoicepay, Comdata and Cambridge? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Oscar, it's Ron again. So I'd say we're still sorting that question. It's a very good question. So obviously, today, you've got the Nvoicepay sales and marketing group selling 100% of what I call offer #2, the full 100% AP outsourcing model. And you've got the core Comdata corporates payments business selling mostly 90% the offer #1, the virtual card that takes out some amount of the AP. 
 I'd say it's more than likely we will integrate the sales and marketing and look at bringing both of those offers to a client, meeting a client and getting clear on what the client is looking for and potentially providing either offer 1 or offer 2. So if you said what's my guess, that would be the guess that Nvoicepay will be a second product and a second offer in the bag so that we could create more pressure with the 80 field people and 50 appointment-setting people so we can create more pressure against that full AP. That's likely where we'll go. 
Oscar Turner: Okay. That's helpful. And second question is on beyond tolls. It sounds like you're gaining traction there. Can you talk about the competitive advantages in nontolls? Do you see it as more of an early-mover advantage in what's a huge market? Or do you actually have exclusive contracts with some of the gas stations and QSR partners? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Another really good question. I mean I think the answer is super simple here. It's our client base. So if you're a merchant, you're a parking operator or you're a guy that owns a few gas stations or you own a few McDonald's franchises, and we knock on the door and say, "Hey, we want to put our payment technology at your place, and we'll tell our 5 million customers about it," that's a generally more interesting proposition than Eric popping up and saying he'll put his technology there and talk to his 0 customers. And so the customer base, Oscar, and the fact that the technology is proven and we can run it in scale, I think, are the advantages, and I think it's shown that we've signed every big person. We've signed the biggest 2 or 3 parking operators in the country. We've signed the 2 or 3 biggest fuel brands. And we've signed obviously the biggest fast food brand. And so I think it's no surprise that we bring a pretty unique proposition to them. 
Operator: The next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. 
David Togut: Congrats on the strong results. I'd like to ask about the MasterCard fuel card growth in the quarter. I didn't hear you call that out. 
Ronald F. Clarke: David, that's why I love you calling in. I forgot to say that we're delighted to report it was a mid-teens revenue grower in Q1. 
David Togut: Got it. And then I'm curious, as you look at the 2 big mergers that have been announced earlier this year, FIS Worldpay and Fiserv First Data, both have called out the B2B payments growth opportunity, I think, both through faster payments and possibly a virtual card-type solution. When you look at these 2 mergers, do you see either one potentially being helpful for you as you expand your TAM in B2B or potentially as a competitive threat? 
Ronald F. Clarke: I'd say neither. I think that our view is that the acquiring world and focus is fundamentally at retailers and at merchants. And so our game is obviously at business employees and business AP. And so I think the core statement is that the marketplaces are just -- they're just dramatically different. Now we may share some of their merchants as acceptors, right, of our card programs, but I would say, other than seeing how investors react to the consolidation in this related fintech space, that has kind of not too much impact on us. 
David Togut: Got it. Just a quick final question. The 40% uplift you're seeing in revenue per client with beyond fuel, are there particular categories that are getting the most traction? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. So we've got the list. So you'd think that some are employee-related adds, as we've said before. So in some verticals, we see the construction expense and the vehicle maintenance. And then we see more traditional kinds of AP, like business supplies, business services. So again, it looks like our clients are picking certain kinds of expense categories to use our card in, our offer in, which again is a little bit how we present it to them, that it's an incremental control card and that they can add a certain category but not others to it. 
 So back to Bob's question earlier, David, our issue is that AP spend is massive relative to the fuel spend in a lot of our clients. So really, how much do we want to stretch that thing, right? And how much do we want to deepen the relationships? So we're going to wade into the thing slowly and try to get a bunch of clients to buy a little bit more and look at the retention rates that, that yields and report back. 
Operator: The next question comes from Peter Christiansen with Citibank. 
Peter Christiansen: I think in the past, you've talked about the bookings to revenue conversion on the corporate payments side being roughly, I don't know, 18 months or so. In the past, you've mentioned that. Now with the Nvoicepay and the full AP disbursement solution, do you think you have an opportunity to compress that period from bookings to revenue? And then my follow-up would be, I know this business. You could distribute to resellers. Can you give us a sense of is that going to expand? Or you're going to bring more in-house? How do you think the sales production will improve on the corporate payments front with that feature? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Peter. It's Ron again. On the question a, I'd say probably no. I think in some ways, the implementation of a full disbursement solution has actually a bit incremental complexity, right, because you're taking 100% of the upload and 100% of the file and doing a little bit of software training and stuff. And so although a lot of it's the same, running through the vendor list and the merchants that take cards and don't, I'd say that no, we're going to get better through process redesign more than we are from having Nvoicepay in this other product, which, by the way, we are working super hard on to your point. If we can compress that even 3 or 6 months, it'll create just what you're saying, mid-term revenue acceleration. 
 On the second one, I think we've reported before about 1/3 of our core corporate pay business is through channel partners, resellers and aggregators and the like. And I think we've said right now, we like that a lot because the TAM is in the trillions and we've got a much smaller business. So for certainly, for the mid-term, we like these partnerships that we have. It's a big, big market. People are attacking different size segments. They're attacking different verticals. And so our direct people rarely run into our channel partners. So I'd say you should expect that we'll stay the course, maybe add a few more and then see if the game's any different 3 or 4 years from now. 
Operator: The next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. 
Ashish Sabadra: Let me add my congrats as well on this solid result. Maybe just like more higher strategic level, I just want to talk -- ask you about your digital initiatives. Can you just help explain how the digital initiative that you've implemented over the last year, how that has helped accelerate growth or improve customer service over the -- across all the different products? And then maybe just a follow-up to that would be you have access to so much data and with all the buzz around Big Data, AI and ML. Can you just help us understand how you plan to leverage the information data that you have regarding hundreds of thousands of small businesses? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Ashish. It's Ron. So yes, I think we spoke to this point maybe one of the last times that we've talked. And so on the digital front, I'd say a few things. So one is the client UI, so we have made lots of investments both in the design and recently in the conversion of hundreds of thousands of our clients now here and abroad to this new, what we call, simple UI. And so that's made a massive difference in the way the client interacts with us. 
 Two, we've done the same thing with new applications. We signed over 30,000 new accounts globally just in the first quarter, and so we put a lot of tech against what we call end-to-end application and implementation, so taking the client right through getting on a website and selling out an app to basically starting and compressing that time and making it all digital. 
 Three, we've ramped up the digital investments in selling. We're now up to 40% or 45% of all new sales. All new accounts that we acquired in the United States are coming purely through digital. We've completely automated the customer call centers with new screens, where we used to have people in 3 or 4 legacy systems toggling back and forth to try to answer a customer's question, resolve his problem. Now we've got the stuff consolidated with one unified view or a customer service agent can see data from 3 or 4 systems at the same time. So I think we've done -- we don't talk about a lot. It's kind of plumbing stuff, but we've done a lot to make the selling and customer experience and even our servicepeople's lives easier because, obviously, the rest of the world was doing that. 
 On your second question, I'd say we're kind of nowhere on the Big Data, which is, hey, how do we take this information and repackage it? And I think the early thought that we've got on this is around benchmarking, where we would take certain kinds of information for similar types of clients and maybe, in an anonymous way, serve that data up for benchmarking to help clients understand the pace. Do they approve invoices all automatically? What's the cycle time so that clients could get some feedback as to how they compare to other like companies? So it's not probably super-duper sexy, but that's our first thought of how to take all this information and create some value back to our clients. 
Ashish Sabadra: That's helpful. Maybe just on the data question, is that an opportunity based on like the insights that you generate from the data that you can help cross-sell different products into the same customer base? For example, now that you have a full stack of AP solution -- full AP solution, is that an opportunity for you to sell full AP solution into your fuel card customer base? 
Ronald F. Clarke: That's funny, interesting question. Just walking down to the call this afternoon, I bumped into the guy that runs the beyond fuel thing for our company and was asking him about that. I said, "Hey, of the 5,000 clients now that have used our card programs to buy AP, have we thought about introducing our full AP solution people?" And he said, "I beat you to it, Ron. We had the first call a month ago, served up clients that we want to have them call on to see if they want to continue the transition from fuel to kind of P-Card only, all the way to full AP." So I'd say there's that opportunity. There's looking at what people buy. So if we see our clients are buying a lot of lodging, for example, we can offer them our lodging products. 
 So I think we're just starting, Ashish, to look at wiring together the various products. We've built the company in a pretty short period of time here and built it kind of product by product, and now we're stepping back and looking at how we can cross-sell the products to the same clients, like this -- you hear in every business, we use the word beyond fuel and beyond toll and more site acceptance in lodging and so on. Really, what we're doing is just widening the offer and the utility, if you will, to the clients that we've already got. So it's a relatively -- it may seem like a simple thought, but it's a relatively still new thought for the company that we're really just getting started. 
Operator: This concludes time allocated for the question-and-answer session and also concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your line. Thank you for participating, and have a pleasant day.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-06 17:56:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the FLEETCOR Technologies Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Jim Eglseder, Head of Investor Relations for FLEETCOR Technologies. Thank you. You may begin. 
James Eglseder: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. By now, you should have access to our fourth quarter press release and supplement, which can be found on our website at fleetcor.com, under the Investor Relations section.
 Throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than non-GAAP information at other companies. Quantitative reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today's press releases and on our website, as previously described. Also, we are providing 2019 guidance on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis with reconciliations.
 Finally, before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements. This includes forward-looking statements about our guidance and outlook, new products and fee initiatives and expectations regarding business development and acquisitions. They are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore, you should not put undue reliance upon them. These results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K and on our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available on our website and at sec.gov.
 With that out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay, Jim, thanks. And as always, we're delighted to be with you this afternoon. Upfront here, I'm going to plan to cover 4 subjects. So first, I'll run through my view of our Q4 results. Second, I'll provide a bit of a wrap-up on our full year 2018 results. Third, I'll preview our guidance for this year, 2019. And then lastly, I'll speak to our company's top priorities.
 Okay, so onto the quarter, Q4 results. We reported Q4 revenue of $643 million and cash EPS of $2.78. That's up 15%. Revenue did surprise us on the upside, finishing over $20 million better than our expectations. We had virtually no scope differences in the quarter. On a consistent GAAP basis, both GAAP revenue and organic revenue both grew 11% in the quarter.
 On the good news front, our fuel card organic revenue growth accelerated to 9%, obviously, overall Q4 revenue particularly strong, first off, because the fuel card growth did normalize into the high single digits. Our corporate pay business rocked, up 24%; toll business, strong again on the back of tag volume, up 4%, along with incremental parking and fuel spend lifting revenues there. Our lodging business continued its healthy small business room night growth. Room night's up 22%. That resulted in 19% overall lodging growth if you exclude FEMA; so really strong revenue performances really across the board.
 Our trends in the quarter also remained very solid; same-store sales, plus 1%; overall client retention, 92%; new sales, new bookings hit record levels, finishing up 20%; and inside of that, our new fuel card sales, up 17%; so a really terrific sales finish.
 So look, all in all, Q4 may be one of our best quarters ever, revenue way above expectations, accelerating organic fuel card revenue growth back to 9%, profits at the top of our guidance range, record sales, and continued healthy client same-store sales and retention levels, so really a nice way to finish.
 Okay. Let me transition to our 2018 full year results. So first up, record financial results across the board: revenue for the full year, up 13%; cash EPS of $10.53, up 23%; full year sales, up 15%. That's with over 120,000 new business clients signed last year.
 Full year organic revenue growth across all of our lines, up 10%; retention, above 90%, taking up to 92% in the second half; and our 2 newest acquisitions, STP acquired in 2016 and Cambridge acquired in 2017, both had really terrific performances last year. So Cambridge, our international payments business, in its first full year with us, grew revenue, 24%; grew sales, 27%; and grew EBITDA, over 60%. And we got that business squarely focused on larger accounts. STP, a great 2018; revenue, up 18%; sales, up 32%; EBITDA, up over 20%. In addition, STP completed a massive IT conversion onto a brand new system, retired their old system. They also greatly expanded their network acceptance, doubling acceptance in parking lots, adding another major fuel retailer to accept their technology and even launched the McDonald's drive-through acceptance; so our newest businesses performing very well.
 Another significant development in 2018 was organization. We created a new, more consolidated organization structure in the company around our 4 major product lines. We now have 1 North American fuel organization, 1 lodging organization that includes the CLS acquisition, 1 Brazil organization that combines our legacy Brazil businesses with STP, and 1 corporate payments business, which combines Comdata corporate pay business with Cambridge; so internally, 4 businesses now aligned with our external reporting. So all around 2018, a very good year, excellent financial performance, terrific new acquisition performance, continued positive fundamentals and trends and really a strengthened management team squarely focused on our 4 major product lines.
 Okay. Let me transition to our outlook for this year, 2019. So today, we're providing organic revenue growth guidance overall of 9% to 11%. We're also providing fuel organic revenue growth guidance of 9% to 11%. That obviously reflects an acceleration from last year. We're also expecting our nonfuel lines, corporate pay, tolls and lodging to all grow mid-teens this year. We're guiding GAAP revenue to $2.6 billion at the midpoint. That reflects a 7% increase in print revenue. We're guiding cash EPS to $11.55 at the midpoint. That reflects a 10% increase in print earnings. 
 Our 2019 outlook on the macro this year is quite challenging. Our assumptions include unfavorable FX, lower fuel prices and higher interest rates, which together, we estimate create about a $0.60 cash EPS headwind to our results in 2019. Eric will cover the bridge in some detail, but from a revenue bridge, again, organic revenue at the midpoint, 10%; a scope change associated with the Chevron divestment of 1%; macro headwinds of 2% equals our print revenue growth guidance of 7%, so 10% minus 1% minus 2%; on the profit or cash EPS side, normalized cash EPS growth expected of 17%. Adjust that for the scope change of the Chevron divestment, 2%; the macro, including higher interest rates, 5% negative. That equals to 10% at the cash EPS print. We're targeting global new sales or sales bookings to grow 15% in 2019, and that's on the back of a 15% increase last year. 
 So I guess the message here is that the fundamentals of the business are quite good. We're guiding to another year of 10% overall organic revenue growth, which translates to 17% normalized cash EPS growth. That's before the impacts of divestments and macro. So that's consistent with our midterm targets of 10% revenue growth and 15% to 20% profit growth.
 Okay, lastly, let me transition to the company's priorities in 2019, so 4 major priorities. So first, our portfolio. We continue to reposition the FLEETCOR portfolio for faster growth. We continue to explore restructuring options for SVS. We're looking to take incremental positions in the corporate pay and hotel space, and we're still pressing to gain entry into Asia; so continuing to work to rebalance the portfolio. 
 Second priority is sales. We continue to build a bigger, more productive global selling system. We're moving to even more digital selling in '19. We're moving to more sales-enabled selling versus cold calling. We're making a bigger effort to sell back to our client base versus just to new prospects. And we continue to explore new channels, new ways to go to market through partners.
 Third priority is our big growth initiatives. We talked at length about our 4 big product expansion opportunities or use cases, including beyond fuel here in the U.S., beyond toll in Brazil, digital booking in lodging, and our full AP offering in corporate pay. We're hopeful that these organic growth initiatives will become more important contributors to revenue as we run through the year.
 And lastly, acquisitions continue to be a top priority for us. We have a number of near-in transactions we're looking at in fuel, in lodging and in corporate pay. We continue to refine the thesis for each of those that would give us the conviction to pull the trigger. 
 So in closing, we're pleased with our Q4 finish and our full year 2018 results. But more importantly, we're pretty bullish on the future. We're out looking 9% to 11% overall organic revenue growth and 9% to 11% fuel card revenue growth this year. Trends and fundamentals are sound. We're working, taking actions to further refine our portfolio for faster growth. We're progressing some of the new product expansion ideas and turning them into important contributors. And we're continuing to chase acquisitions that we can improve and make accretive. So we like what we see.
 So with that, let me turn the call back over to Eric to provide some additional details on the quarter. Eric? 
Eric R. Dey: Okay, thanks, Ron. Before I get started on the numbers, I want to remind everyone that the company has adopted the new revenue recognition standard, ASC Topic 606 via the modified retrospective method of adoption effective January 1, 2018. Under this method, 2017 results are not restated. As I have done previously, I will talk about revenue in 2 ways: first, using the new GAAP convention, which compares 2018 using the new ASC 606 standard to 2017 using the prior standard; and then I will discuss revenue for 2018 and 2017 as if ASC 606 was never adopted so you can compare revenues the way we have historically presented it. This is the last quarter I will be comparing revenue to the prior revenue standard, ASC 605, as starting in 2019, the quarters will be comparable.
 Now onto the quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2018, on a GAAP basis under ASC 606 standard, we reported revenue of $643.4 million, up 5.5% compared to $610 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. As a reminder, merchant commissions and certain third-party processing expenses are now netted against revenue, which resulted in a reduction in revenue of approximately $36 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus the prior standard.
 For the fourth quarter of 2018, GAAP net income increased 7% to $302 million or $3.33 per diluted share from $282.7 million or $3.05 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017. Included in the fourth quarter of 2018 net income was $153 million gain from the sale of the Chevron portfolio. Included in the fourth quarter 2017 net income was a benefit of $127.5 million from the adoption of the new Tax Reform Act.
 Revenues in the fourth quarter of 2018, excluding the impact of ASC 606, were $679.9 million, up 11% compared to $610 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2018 increased 12% to $252 million compared to $224.1 million, and adjusted net income per diluted share increased 15% to $2.78 compared to $2.42 in the fourth quarter of 2017.
 We also experienced a mixed macroeconomic environment in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared with the fourth quarter of 2017. Movements in foreign exchange rates were primarily negative, with most of the impact from the Brazilian real as the currency was down roughly 15% from the fourth quarter of 2017. We believe foreign exchange rates negatively impacted revenue during the quarter by approximately $25 million. 
 Fuel prices declined in the quarter, but most of the decline happened late in the quarter, which caused year-over-year fuel prices to still be favorable by approximately 10%. And although we cannot precisely calculate the impact of these price changes, we believe our revenue was positively impacted by approximately $9 million. And finally, fuel spreads had about a $13 million positive impact in the quarter as spreads widened at the end of the quarter as fuel prices fell. So in total, those changes had a negative impact of approximately $3 million on our fourth quarter revenue compared with the fourth quarter of 2017.
 Organic revenue growth was 11% overall for the second quarter in a row. All of our major product categories performed well during the quarter. And as expected, our fuel card business finally lapped the 2017 conversion issue and produced 9% organic growth, which was a little better than we had expected back in October. 
 The corporate payments category continues to perform very well and was up 24% organically during the quarter. The growth in corporate payments was driven by both Cambridge, which grew in excess of 30% in the quarter, and the Comdata Corporate Payments business, which grew 20%. Our toll business was up 13% organically, slightly lower than the third quarter as we started to lap some pricing initiatives implemented in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
 Our Lodging business was up 4% as the growth rate was negatively impacted by the lapping of approximately $6 million of FEMA revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding the FEMA impact in both periods, the growth rate this quarter would have been approximately in 19% as we continue to add customers and grow room nights. As a reminder, there was also about $4 million in FEMA benefit in the first quarter of 2018, which will cause the reported organic growth rate for our lodging segment to potentially be in the upper single digits in the first quarter of 2019.
 Excluding that impact, we expect that the core growth rate will be at the mid to high teens for the first quarter of 2019.
 Now moving down the income statement. Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $358.7 million compared to $370 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Included in the fourth quarter of 2018 was the impact of ASC 606, which netted approximately $39 million of merchant commissions and certain processing expenses against revenue. Excluding these impacts in 2018, operating expenses would have been up approximately 7%. The increase was primarily due to acquisitions completed in the second half of 2017, other investments funded from savings from the new Tax Act and asset write-offs.
 As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses were approximately 56% compared to 61% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding ASC 606, operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue would have been approximately 58% in the fourth quarter of 2018.
 Credit losses were $21 million for the fourth quarter or 8 basis points compared to $8.9 million or 5 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2017.
 The increase in credit losses was primarily due to an increase in fraud losses in the fuel card business and a onetime customer bankruptcy. We do not expect the fraud losses to continue at that level as we have implemented measures to reduce the losses going forward. Although we currently expect losses to be a bit higher than normal in the first quarter of 2019 and return to more historical levels in the second quarter of 2019.
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 2% to $67.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 from $65.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to additional CapEx spending.
 Interest expense increased 24% to $38.2 million compared to $30.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase in interest expense was due primarily to increases in LIBOR and additional borrowing for share buybacks.
 Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 23.9% compared to a tax benefit of 35.7% for the fourth quarter of 2017. As a reminder, included in the fourth quarter of 2017 was the favorable impact of adoption of the Tax Reform Act of $127.5 million.
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in total cash. Approximately $313 million is restricted and consists primarily of customer deposits. As of December 31, 2018, we had $3.9 billion outstanding on our term loan and revolver and approximately $250 million of undrawn availability. We also had $886 million borrowed in our securitization facility at the end of the quarter. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2018, we repurchased approximately 3 million shares of our stock for $578 million, resulting in a total share buyback for 2018 of approximately 5 million shares for $959 million. 
 Also on January 23, the FLEETCOR board authorized a further increase in the share buyback authorization of $500 million resulting in total current repurchase authorization of $551 million. As of December 31, 2018, our leverage ratio was 2.35x EBITDA, which is well below our covenant level of 4x EBITDA, as calculated under our credit agreement. We intend to use our future excess cash flow to temporarily pay down the balance on our revolving credit facility and securitization facility and maintain liquidity for acquisitions and other corporate purposes.
 Finally, CapEx expense in the fourth quarter was $25.1 million.
 Now onto the outlook for 2019. Before I walk you through our 2019 outlook, there are a number of puts and takes I want to make sure you have considered as you model the walk from 2018 actuals to our 2019 guidance. Please refer to our fourth quarter earnings call supplement for a bridge from 2018 to 2019 revenue and adjusted net income per share. 
 First, we are planning for another 9% to 11% organic growth rate year. Please note that all discussions in 2019 on fuel card organic growth will exclude the impact of the Chevron divestiture. The fuel card category is now expected to grow organically in the 9% to 11% range, which is back to historical levels. Growth is expected to be led by continued solid performance in most of our fuel card businesses, including the International operation, the North America trucking business and a return to solid growth in our North America local operation. We expect the corporate payments, toll and lodging businesses to grow mid-teens in 2019 and gift and other to be approximately flat. Our 2019 guidance includes the Chevron divestiture impact of approximately $35 million in revenue and approximately $0.19 in adjusted net income per share. The conversion is expected to be completed early in the second quarter so the impact will be fully in the run rate in the second quarter. 
 I also want to update you on our latest thinking about the macroeconomic environment. We expect the macro to negatively impact our revenue and profit for 2019. We are estimating that the actual price of fuel will be about 10% lower than the 2018 average. Foreign exchange rates, if they continue to be at today's level, will also have a negative impact on revenue; and spreads will be slightly unfavorable to 2018. In total, we believe these items will create an estimated $50 million revenue headwind and negatively impact cash EPS by about $0.30 to $0.35 per share.
 Other items that will impact our 2019 results include lower share count due to 2018 share repurchases, which will positively impact adjusted net income per share by about $0.40. Interest expense is projected to be approximately $20 million higher in 2019 versus 2018 due to the impact of share buybacks and increases in the LIBOR rate. We did enter an interest rate swap agreement to fix approximately $2 billion of our debt, limiting the downside risk from further rising rates. So all in, we estimate the higher interest expense will negatively impact 2019 EPS by an estimated $0.17 per share. 
 So with that out of the way, our guidance for 2019 is as follows: total revenues between $2,570,000,000 and $2,630,000,000; net income to be between $800 million and $830 million; net income per diluted share to be between $9.05 and $9.35; adjusted net income to be between $1,015,000,000 and $1,045,000,000; adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $11.40 and $11.70. This guidance represents approximately a 7% growth in revenue and 10% growth in adjusted net income per diluted share for the year at the midpoint of the range. However, the overall message here is that the fundamentals of our business are quite good, another year of guiding to 9% to 11% organic growth -- revenue growth, which delivers 17% normalized adjusted net income per share growth before the impacts of divestments and the macro. 
 Some of the assumptions we have made in preparing the guidance include the following: weighted fuel prices equal to $2.60 per gallon average in the U.S. for those businesses sensitive to the movement in the retail price of fuel for the balance of the year; market spreads slightly unfavorable to the 2018 average; foreign exchange rate equal to the 7-day average as of the week ending February 3, 2019; interest expense of $160 million; fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately 89 million shares; and an adjusted tax rate of 23% to 24%; and as always, no impact related to acquisitions or material new partnership agreements not already disclosed. 
 Now for the first quarter. I want to remind everyone that our business has some seasonality and that typically, the first quarter is the lowest in terms of both revenue and profit. First quarter seasonality is impacted by weather, holidays in the U.S. and lower business levels in Brazil due to summer break and the Carnival celebration that occurs in the first quarter. Also, the first quarter revenue will be impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rates when compared to the first quarter of 2018 as well as the Chevron divestiture. 
 With that said, we are expecting our first quarter 2019 adjusted net income per share to be between $2.55 and $2.65. Additionally, our volumes should build throughout the year and our new initiative gain momentum throughout the year, resulting in higher revenue and earnings per share in the second through fourth quarters. 
 With that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. 
Ramsey El-Assal: I had a question on guidance. In the context of the acceleration that you're anticipating in the second through fourth quarters, how much are you depending on the new products, like beyond fuel and beyond tolls, to accelerate, to basically gain traction? And how good of a line of sight do you have that, that will materialize at this point? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Ramsey, it's Ron. I'd say still not super significant, maybe, call it, 1 point just to give you an estimate. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. And then I wanted to ask about just in general, the impact of fuel prices on the business. It seems like over time, we've seen the part of your business that is directly exposed to fuel, the discount revenue side of that get a little more heavily weighted versus the spread-based revenue. And I'm sure -- I know Comdata, when you bought that company, it had -- it mixed that around a bit. Should we continue to see the sort of discount exposure of the business grow and the spread exposure shrink? And what are the drivers there now of that mix shift? 
Eric R. Dey: Say again, Ramsey. I'm not sure I'm clear. 
Ramsey El-Assal: So you have revenues there directly exposed to fuel and some of it is basically sort of like interchange exposure and some of it is spread-based exposure, basically. Now we're seeing that the spread-based exposure is a little smaller than it used to be historically and I'm just wondering whether that trend continues. In other words, did this more and more of your fuel exposure relate to this sort of direct interchange exposure versus spread-based pricing? Is it -- did I make sense? Or am I still confusing you? 
Eric R. Dey: No. Ramsey, this is Eric. I think what you said is basically correct. I mean, obviously, our spread-based businesses are growing at a little slower rate than the other business are in total. So as the other businesses grow, clearly, the revenue in those businesses or that the revenue impacted by spread is going to continue to get smaller. If that's what you're... 
Ramsey El-Assal: It's basically -- it's just mix issue, basically, kind of a geographic mix issue almost here. 
Eric R. Dey: It's completely a mix issue. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. 
Ashish Sabadra: So my question was on the non-fee businesses. You had some difficult comps there in -- going into '19 and still you talked about this mid-teens growth. And so I was just wondering if you could help us understand how you plan to overcome some of the difficult comparables in '19. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Ashish, it's Ron. I'd say again the reason for a bit of deceleration from this year is we lapped some pricing. In most of those businesses, it's just volume. Like in corporate pay, in Cambridge, it's really all volume. In tolls, it's a bit of mix and a bit of the new things. And in lodging, it's basically volume in the small SMB segment. And so we've modeled the sales and retention rates in those business. And I'd say we're pretty comfortable all 3 are heading towards mid-teens, plus or minus 1. 
Ashish Sabadra: That's absolutely great. And then just maybe one quick clarifying question. The guidance, the 2019 earnings guidance, that does not include any kind of capital allocation in 2019, including any kind of share repurchases that you might be making in 2019. I just wanted to confirm that. And it just includes whatever you did in 2018. Is that right, Eric? 
Eric R. Dey: That is correct, Ashish. We do not anticipate and we sure didn't plan for any additional share buybacks or any M&A similar to what we do in prior -- what we've done in prior years as well. 
Ashish Sabadra: That's good, so if any kind of additional share repurchases that you do this year would be incremental. That's helpful. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. 
David Togut: Good to see the 24% growth in corporate payments for the fourth quarter. Can you talk about the underlying drivers of that growth in terms of what specific verticals or products were particularly strong? And then in connection with that, can you give us a status update on ASAP, the new full bill payment automation solution you launched in the third quarter with AvidXchange? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, David, it's Ron. So a few things. I think one, the health care portion of that business continues to shrink relative to the total. It's actually in the plus column. So I'd say that that's the first thing. And then the core business, the geographic business and the construction business are just booming way, way up. And then I'd say, third, a couple of the new channel partners, the CSI, the AvidXchange, we signed Bill.com in the fourth quarter. Some of our partners, I'd say, are accelerating their growth, their spend growth. So those would be the handful of drivers. On part 2 of the question, ASAP, I'd say it's still early days. We're out of the blocks. We've got a couple of teams selling first set of accounts wrong. We've worked out the model, how we're going to price and service. So I'd say that we're up, we're live, we're building. I'd say the real confidence or interest in the thing is through these partner relationships through the lenses of seeing how they're doing. So 2 or 3 of these relationships that we serve are squarely in this full AP business. So as their process or we see those volumes, so we see that the market is receptive to that offer and the sizes of the clients taking an offer, so we're seeing firsthand the acceptance of that. So I think it's just a pacing thing. I think our conviction that that's going to be a big, big deal is there. 
David Togut: As a quick follow-up, Eric, what average fuel price assumption are you using in the first quarter guidance? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes, we use $2.60 across all 4 quarters, David. 
Ronald F. Clarke: In North America. 
Eric R. Dey: In North America, right. So for those businesses that are sensitive in the movement in the retail price of fuel, we use $2.60. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: I guess, Eric, when you look at the revenue growth versus the EPS, it seems like the operating leverage isn't quite there as much as one would think. Can you just help us think through that? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes. Actually, from our perspective, it's right where it kind of should be. Our EBITDA margins are running in the high -- kind of the mid- to high 50% range. If you look at the incremental revenue and the incremental EBITDA in our budget next year, it probably -- EBITDA margins in the low 60s, which is in line with the leverage we would expect from our business. Our fixed cost run approximately 2/3, and variable costs run around 1/3. So it's in line with the way we would always think about the business. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Sanjay, it's Ron. You're referring to Q4 or '19 in the question? 
Eric R. Dey: It would be '19. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: More '19. I was just wondering if there's more upside to the margin over time, I guess. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, again, if you follow the bridge, it's kind of 10% and 17%, right, normalized, so without the divestments and without the macro. So we think that's decent kind of leverage. 
Eric R. Dey: And shares in there. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Okay, great. And then maybe on M&A, it's obviously been quite a long time since we've seen the deal from you guys. Could you just talk about the environment right now and sort of what's hurting or helping your cost right now? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I'd say it's kind of business as usual. We've got, as I said in the opening remarks, a number of near-end 4, 5 transactions that we're well into, that we're looking at, sitting in our core categories in fuel, lodging and corporate pay. And so I'd say, hey, what's the reason we've taken a 1-year hiatus, the answer is that when we got to the goal line on some of the deals last year, we just didn't like them enough versus the prices. Some of the prices have gone up in our space certainly pre this correction, and so we just want to make doubly sure at high price levels that the thesis is sound and the returns are there. And so I'd say that it's certainly -- more likely, you'll see us pull the trigger in 2019, given we didn't last year, but we're -- for all those wondering, we are still in the M&A business. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Oscar Turner with SunTrust. 
Oscar Turner: So my first question is on corporate payments and some of the partnerships you just discussed. I was wondering if you can give some color on what portion of revenue in that segment today is indirect through partnerships with AvidXchange as opposed to direct. And then does more of a partnership approach have implications on pricing power long term? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Oscar, it's Ron. So I'd give you kind of a ballpark. I'd say in our corporate pay without our FX business, it's in the neighborhood of 1/3, 30% to 1/3 of our revenue. Our interest in it is that, that space is just a massive TAM. It's a massive market and so it needs a lot of coverage, and so we like the fact that there's more marketing pressure from more people that's kind of off-balance sheet doing that. And so we like the business a lot and then the -- obviously, we learn as our partners take different approaches or go after different segments. It's obviously informative to us. And then on your question of pricing and stuff, we've obviously got good relationships. We sign pretty long contracts with those kind of partners so we don't get them into business and then find their way away from us. So I'd say that generally, our channel contracts are longer in term than some of our other contracts in the company. 
Oscar Turner: Okay. That's helpful. And then follow-up questions on tolls. Just wondering how we should think about what's driving the mid-teens growth outlook for that segment. Transactions growth there, I guess, which is more synonymous with subscriptions, has remained at the low single-digit range. So is pricing likely to remain as the main driver for that segment? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean, I guess it's a classic mix, I'd say, in the plan in front of me. But I'd call out, I think, 4% volume or tag growth in Q4. My guess is it's in that similar range, kind of 4% to 5% volume growth. There is some inflation both in revenue and in cost in that market, which would be another few percent. And then really, it's the mix of the type of business that we sign up and it's the add-on things that we talked about. So I think I mentioned that with this parking expansion and the fuel expansion, we get MDR now, so without having to change fundamentally what the customer pays, picking up incremental revenue. So I'd say it's those 3, volume, some inflation, and then basically some spend lift. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Darrin, are you there? 
Darrin Peller: Oh, guys, hey, sorry about that. Can you hear me now? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes. 
Ronald F. Clarke: We can hear you now. 
Darrin Peller: All right. Look, just given the strong growth we're seeing in the quarter on fuel, I think it'd be helpful if you could just walk us through a bridge from the '18 growth rate in fuel to the '19 organic assumption of 9% to 11%. Just there's a lot of moving parts. So what's the contribution of each, whether it's a sales process or now the MasterCard growth assumption or anything on pricing? I mean, it is clearly a good result in the quarter on it and the trend in the outlook was good. 
Ronald F. Clarke: So let me sure I got your question. Hey, hey, how are you going from a 9% fuel organic to a 9% to 11% in 2019, what's going on there? 
Darrin Peller: Yes, pretty much. I mean, it was, yes -- and I think it trended up through the year even to the 9%. So I guess, I'm just looking at the full year '18 versus '19. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. So the short story on why 9% versus, I think, full year of a 5% in '18 is clearly, the comps, Darrin, that grow over, right? We finally -- hopefully, we'll never speak about the 2-year-old GFN conversion. So we completely lapped that in Q4, and our MasterCard product line here in the U.S. went positive. So instead of being negative against the comps, it turned positive. And that thing -- we put resources back onto it this year. So that thing is out looking almost mid-teens again, back -- almost back to the old days in 2019. So the way we would help you guys think about it is really look at Q4 as the base, not the full year, because that's the better view of the comps and look at it sequentially and say, okay, how are you going to go from 9% to, call it, the midpoint of what we've given you, 10%. It's really kind of 1 point of acceleration. And it's in -- I'd say it's the comment that one of the guys asked at the beginning. I'd say the incremental 1% are kind of the new, new things, the new combo, payroll, fuel card and that, the beyond fuel, so a bunch of the new things we're working on, extended network in Russia. There's things going on really in every business that will eat that thing up. And again, off of the sequential number, it's really going up 1 point, kind of 9% to 10% at the midpoint. 
Darrin Peller: Okay, that's helpful, guys. And then just quick follow-up. Is there any large-scale deals on the horizon or RFPs we need to know about that could be opportunities or even risks to your current portfolio? 
Ronald F. Clarke: You want M&A or on partners? 
Darrin Peller: No, I'm talking about either partners potentially, potentially in Europe or elsewhere as well as current existing portfolios that could be in -- looking around. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Got it. So on the -- let me take the second part first. No, we do a contract review. I would say that there were no significant, call it, very large contracts up in the midterm and the next few years. And then two, I'd say on new partners, I'd say there is nothing close-in -- if you said to me, is there something that would be signed by anybody, us or someone else, in the next 6 to 9 months, I'd say no, not that I know of. I mean, like I commented on M&A earlier, I'd say yes, there are a number of active deals that are enclosed that we're far along on that will either go or not go. So I'd say most likely on door 3. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Solid results, I just wanted to better understand. I think you answered in Darrin's -- in your answer to Darrin's question. But the outlook for fiscal '19 is a little bit better than what you previewed 90 days ago. So what got a little bit better? What's giving you more confidence in laying out this outlook that you have? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Tien-Tsin, yes, it's a good question. I'd say it's incrementally better. I don't want to get on your -- make like 90 days, the whole world has changed. I'd say that everything has inched a bit better. Our sales were a bit better, right, came in at 20%. That rolls forward. Our retention eked up another point, so when you roll those into the model. So the trends have improved a bit. And then for the other question, I think that progress on some of our new stuff has given us kind of a tiny bit more lift here in '19. So I'd say those 2 or 3 things were -- are incrementally better than when we talked to you guys last. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Okay. It's good to see the retention efforts are showing up here. So on the -- as a follow-up, the 20% growth in the new sales, I feel like I always ask you this, forgive me. Can you decompose that for us a little bit what's selling well? You mentioned 17% in fuel. Anything else to share? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean, that was the main thing also I wanted to call out. It's, "Hey, the company's total sales are growing. Hey, maybe it's just all in corporate pay." No, I want to make sure people are clear of it. The core, 45% of the company, sales are up 17% in the quarter. It's almost across the board we're having a record sales in Brazil. I call out because of the new channels, 1/3 of all the sales now. In the toll business or the new channels, those were kind of 0 virtually when we bought the company 2 years ago. Cambridge, I think I called out on its performance. It's just rocking and they've got a big sales plan again in '19. So I'd say it's really generally across the board, mid-teens plus kind of selling going on in every segment; lodging going good. So it's really everywhere. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. 
Robert Napoli: On same-store sales, so when you put out a stable number, good number, 1% growth, is that -- can you talk about that by segment? Where are you seeing any acceleration or deceleration, I mean, a little more noise in the U.S. economy and in some regards with -- related to the oil industry? Can you just talk about by segment where you're seeing any strength or any softness? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Bob, it's Ron. I would say it hasn't moved a lot. We quoted these numbers over, probably many quarters now, kind of whatever it's been, plus 2%, plus 1%, the last set of quarters. So if you look at the trend chart, which I have, it hasn't moved a lot. I'd say the super positive same-store are in places like lodging. That's super healthy because of this SMB digital stuff. We're in double digits there of same-store because we just get more out of the clients we have, and the large clients like rail and stuff have gotten way healthier in the last 12 to 18 months. So that one's great. The corporate pay has built in same-store right because expenses grow in companies and the merchant, network growth -- so a single client might have $20 million of invoices to pay per month then we're getting 20% of them. We eke it up to 25% and then their invoices go up to 22%. So it has a built-in fundamental client spend and revenue growth. And then I'd say the couple of markets, the Russia, Brazil economies are way better certainly than 2 years ago and, I think, still improving. So we have really good, high same-store in both of those locations, so pockets of strength. And I'd say the rest of the stuff, like the U.S. stuff, kind of solid, chugging along as it has been. 
Robert Napoli: Okay. And just on Brazil, with that market -- I mean, it obviously is a little volatile, politically and otherwise. Are you -- how are you feeling about that business in that market as a -- long term from a growth perspective? And you said you have -- obviously, you're seeing a little bit better on the ground but just maybe a little bit of about your confidence in building that business and what you expect out of it over the next 3 to 5 years. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, that's a great question. Obviously, a market like that is a bit of a mixed bag and has had some amount of uncertainty. I'd say on the good news front, the political thing looks like it's gone pro-business. The economy and, more importantly, the employment numbers have gotten way better, again, in the last year or 2. So I think inflation is frankly down and forecasted to be down. So I think the core economic things there look better certainly than they have in a couple of years, but for us, it's really, I think, the long view that it's a big, big market, lots of people, and it's a great payments market and it's an underdeveloped payments market, and it's a big TAM in the stuff that we do. One of the guys, one of the companies that does a bit of what we do, called Edenred, has half of the company's total profits in that one country. And so I'd say that we feel from the payments lines that we're above. We've got to be there. It's just too big and too early days not to try to go capture some of it but with that, make sure you guys aren't missing. We're aware of some of the other kinds of risk and obviously take that into account as we look at things there. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. 
James Faucette: I just had a couple of follow-up questions just to those that have already been asked. First, you mentioned, in response to Tien-Tsin's question, that -- where you'd see some improvement. I guess, my question there is, has there been anything particularly in the last 60 days or so as people have gotten more nervous about the economy that tempered your enthusiasm or where you were seeing improvement? Any indications where there could be some incremental weakness perhaps that made you a little less enthusiastic? And then my second question was, when you looked at and you talked about M&A and wanting to be sure but on some of the deals you might -- may pull the trigger, but are you adjusting at all your overall targets or strategy around the kinds of acquisitions you might like to do? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, on the first one, James, I think, again, it's really to kind of repeat what I said. I think it's just incremental. I think our guidance -- 90 days ago, we're trying to be a bit conservative because we're looking at different compares to the period and I think again, over this last sets of days, the things -- all the things that drive the growth have gotten incrementally better. I think I mentioned at the outset that even we were surprised to the tune of, call it, $20 million better in the quarter. So things just got better. And our exit rates and stuff looked better. So I think we're as confident as you can be that, that thing has turned the corner and is heading to step up a bit. On your part 2 on the deal question, I think -- yes, I think the environment certainly has changed some in the last few years. The prices are higher because there's more people kind of in the game, kind of in our game, which I think is taking prices up. And I think we're focused on some different categories that have maybe more midterm potential than they do year 1 potential and maybe more revenue growth potential than immediate accretion potential. And so obviously, we weigh all of those things as we look at targets and try to balance it, try to not overspend for some hope and, at the same time, make sure we're buying businesses that have good midterm prospects, not just onetime profit improvement. So I do think we've moved a bit of the view and again, I think on the non-fuel categories, that we want to be really sure when we pull the trigger. So we're doing extra work. And if we don't feel confident enough, we'd walk by some things. But I would say again that people shouldn't think just because we spent $1 billion last year that we've retired from M&A and we're going to be buying back stock and delevering. I would say that we will be buying stuff. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. 
James Schneider: Related to the corporate payments area, a lot of questions on that, but I wanted to ask you a sort of different question about your willingness to partner with the different partners you've already talked about over the past couple of quarters versus your desire to make a scale acquisition in this area. Is that something where you're trying to try out different kind of business models and verticals before you decide on a larger acquisition to make? Or how are you kind of weighing the benefits of buy versus partner? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean, obviously, Jim, in some of the cases that I've called out, they come to us, right, as the "supplier, as the vendor, as the processor." So we responded. And again, it's been an attractive relationship, commercial relationship because we have some things they need and, therefore, money and the sales and marketing, and we can make returns. And as I said, we can learn. So I think our modus up to now, we have been responsive to people that are trying to be in the space because we view there's plenty of room for a lot of people as the market is big. In terms of transactions, I think like always, if we thought whether it's a partner or not a partner that there's capabilities. We could telescope time by acquiring something that's always something that we're thinking about looking at. And obviously, it takes 2 to tango. You need people on the other side that have that interest as well. But for sure, we're -- as you know, we're looking at the landscape. We know everybody in it. And if we think something makes sense to acquire, we will certainly approach people. 
James Schneider: Fair enough. And then on a related note, is there anything you see in the 2019 outlook that would prevent you from doing sort of the 20% plus growth rate in corporate pay that you -- the run rate that you've been on, especially given the new partnerships you've just signed? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Again, I think we -- outlook, I think we said kind of mid-teens. So if you said to me what do we think, our corporate pay business, which is the virtual card business, the partner business and the Cambridge business, I'd say we're comfortable with those numbers. And if you guys recall, lots of that business is effectively already sold. So in that particular line of business, it's much more of an implementation issue in terms of hitting the revenue plan than it is in new sales. So I'd say to you that we're pretty comfortable generally with the guidance we gave you guys. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions and this does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2018 Q3  (2018-10-30 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jim Eglseder, Head of Investor Relations for FLEETCOR Technologies. Thank you. You may begin. 
James Eglseder: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. By now you should have access to our third quarter press release and supplement, which can be found on our website at www.fleetcor.com, under the Investor Relations section.
 Throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than other companies' non-GAAP information. Quantitative reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today's press release and on our website, as previously described. Also, we are providing updated 2018 guidance on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis with reconciliations.
 Finally, before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements. This includes forward-looking statements about our guidance and outlook, new products and fee initiatives and expectations regarding business development and acquisitions. They are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore, you should not put undue reliance upon them. These results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. 
 Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K and on our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available on our website and at www.sec.gov.
 With that out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay, Jim, thanks, and it's good to be with everyone this afternoon. Up front here, I'll plan to cover 2 subjects. So first, I'll provide my view of the Q3 results, review our guidance for 2018 and provide a bit of a preview of 2019. And then second, I'll provide a progress update on our growth initiatives and M&A activities.
 Okay, so on to the quarter. We reported Q3 revenue of $620 million, up 12% and cash EPS of $2.68, up 23%. So both revenue and cash EPS finishing the high end of our guidance range. Organic growth, revenue growth 11% for the quarter. So quite good. Inside of that, fuel finished at 5% and our nonfuel categories, again, very strong. Toll, up 17%; Lodging, up 21%; corporate pay, up 28%; even gift in the positive column, up 4%. 
 So behind that, some of the drivers of the performance. So in fuel, a number of our fuel card businesses doing quite well. Our card lock business, double-digit from the fleet-wide extended network card. Our climate [ controlled ] trucking business, double digit through the rollout of this fuel and payroll card combo. And 4 of our international businesses, Russia, Mexico, Australia and the Netherlands, all double digits on the back of strong volume increases.
 Unfortunately, some of these high-growth fuel card businesses were offset by revenue declines in our GFN MasterCard and Chevron portfolios, which we're finally about to lap.
 Toll was up really on the strength of new sales, lots of new accounts added and lots from our new channels, and the client base grew a bit as the Brazil economy strengthened. Our usage-based pricing structure also added to the total growth.
 Lodging, up over 20%, mostly due to the small business accounts growing very rapidly. In that segment, we're at 3x the rate per transaction that we do in the large account segment. We also benefited from increased usage from our existing hotel clients, in part because of the ease of use of our new digital booking tool. Corporate pay, another very good quarter, up 28%. The pure spend or volume growth in our direct construction and reseller channels, up over 20%. So simply put, just more business.
 Additionally, inside of corporate pay, our payroll card business up significantly. That was based on a pricing change from earlier in the year. So look, good performances across really all 4 of our product lines. 
 Now on to the fundamentals or trends, so very consistent in the quarter. Same-store sales up 1%. New sales up 6% with over 32,000 new clients signed and customer retention were improved to 92%, which is a tick better than Q2.
 So from our perspective, Q3, a solid quarter. Good revenue and profit growth despite a not very helpful environment, also continued steady fundamentals and trends.
 Okay. Let me transition over to rest of year guidance. So today, we're raising 2018 full year cash EPS from $10.42 to $10.45 at the midpoint. That reflects our overperformance in the quarter. If we achieve Q4 cash EPS of $2.70 at the midpoint, that will result in full year 2018 EPS profit growth of 22%. Additionally, full year 2018 cash EPS of $10.45 would be 50% higher than full year 2016 cash EPS of $6.92. So profits up 50% in 2 years.
 Underlying our Q4 profit guidance is an expectation for Q4 organic revenue growth in the 8% to 9% range, with fuel card growth expected to accelerate to 7% to 8% as we finally lap GFN conversion issue.
 So our 3-year organic revenue growth looks pretty consistent, 8% in calendar '16, 9% last year in '17 and we're expecting 9% here in 2018.
 Okay. Let me move on to a brief preview of our 2019 outlook. It's still early days in our '19 budgeting process, but we do want to confirm an outlook of 8% to 10% organic revenue growth again next year, with an expectation that fuel would be in the 7% to 9% range and our nonfuel lines in the low to mid-teens, excluding gift. We will have a view on our profit flow-through for '19 based upon this high single-digit revenue growth expectation when we talk to you again in 90 days. Still lots of macro assumptions to sort through.
 Okay. Let me transition over to an update of our major growth initiatives in the company. As we previously have discussed, we believe it's FLEETCOR's 3 growth paths, which are more customers, more spend and more geography, provides us with ample opportunity to continue to grow the business over the midterm. 
 So we've got initiatives underway in each of our 4 product categories to attract more customers and to get more spend. So in fuel, our initiative is Beyond Fuel. We're running this growth initiative in both the U.S. and the U.K., in which our fuel card programs run on the MasterCard and Visa rails. That enables us to open up the card to additional spend categories like maintenance, construction supplies, G&E or just general payables. 
 So our Beyond Fuel initiative has taken really 3 forms. So first, a construction card for the construction vertical in which cardholders can buy both construction supplies and fuel. Second, a fuel and prepaid payroll card in 1 for our trucking segments, in which truck drivers can receive their payroll while on the road and then use it like a prepaid card within the MasterCard network. And then lastly, our companion card, which we issue to existing fuel card clients to purchase general AP on the same account.
 So each of these 3 new Beyond Fuel card programs are live, gaining traction and will contribute to incremental revenue in 2019.
 So second, Beyond Toll or Fuel First initiative in Brazil, the idea there is to expand STP's acceptance network Beyond Toll, so parking, fuel, fast food, even rental car acceptance. The idea is to attract urban, non-toll users into the fold and also allow STP's 5 million existing toll users to enjoy the added convenience of the new acceptance sites. So we're making some real progress on expanding the STP network. So we recently signed the largest parking operator in Brazil, which added 500 new parking sites to the existing 500. So airports, malls, sporting events. Fuel, we've been operational with Shell and recently signed Petrobras, installing 150 new fueling locations now.
 Fast food, some terrific news. We ran a test recently with McDonald's which went well. So we signed an agreement now to expand to 100 McDonald's drive-throughs to speed people through the line. And then finally, rental cars, we're testing with 2 of the largest rental car companies in Brazil, adding STP tags to their fleet. So as we build out acceptance, we will turn on our pretty large customer base to these new expanded locations. We believe this is a fundamental transformation for STP from an electronic toll-only company to a broader mobility payment company, which we think provides really a long runway.
 So next, Lodging, making good progress there on a couple of fronts. So first in digital booking. We expect 50% of all small business Lodging room nights this quarter, Q4, to be booked electronically. That's up from virtually 0 just 2 years ago. So this not only increases spend or lift among our existing SMB clients, it also makes a more attractive proposition for new clients.
 Second, we plan to expand our hotel network from 15,000 proprietary locations to 25,000 locations as we bolt on a convenience network, which will give our clients more choice in where to stay. So we expect this network expansion to further lift our client room nights once it's rolled out in Q1. 
 Lastly, in corporate pay, we've now gone live with what we call our full bill pay automation solution or ASAP, in which we pay 100% of the clients' invoices really irrespective of how the bills are paid. Our partner on this initiative is Avid, who's been at this for quite some time and is growing rapidly. We're live. We're signing up our own small clients now to this complete solution and building out our field sales and digital distribution. So we think this initiative will be incremental to our core corporate pay business because it targets a different and smaller customer. 
 So I hope the message is clear. We're working a number of new incremental growth initiatives in each of our 4 businesses. They generally target new users or new segments and/or create lift or more spend among existing users, so chasing more customers and more spend.
 Okay. Last up is M&A. So as we usually report, we are quite active on the M&A front, currently working on a number of transactions, most of which are within our 4 existing product categories. We do continue also to explore new homes for our gift card business. As I say every time, I hope to have a better view on that next time as we speak.
 So look, in summary, from our perspective, a good Q3, over 20% profit growth in the quarter and continued consistent fundamentals and trends. We expect a good finish to '18, in which we'll deliver greater than 20% EPS profit growth for the full year, which would be a 50% increase versus full year 2016. 2019, we're outlooking high single-digit organic revenue growth that would be consistent with the last 3 years.
 And finally, some progress on a set of new organic growth initiatives and M&A opportunities that we think present upside over time.
 So with that, let me turn the call back over to Eric to provide some additional detail on the quarter. Eric? 
Eric R. Dey: Okay. Thanks, Ron. Before I get started on the numbers, I want to remind everyone that the company has adopted a new revenue recognition standard, ASC topic 606, via the modified retrospective method of adoption effective January 1, 2018. Under this method, 2017 results are not restated. And as I've done in both quarters previously, I will talk about revenue in 2 ways. First, using a new GAAP convention, which compares 2018 using the new ASC 606 standard to 2017, using the prior standard. And then I will discuss revenue for 2018 and 2017 as if ASC 606 was never adopted, so you can compare revenues at where we have historically presented it.
 Now on to the quarter, for the third quarter of 2018 on a GAAP basis under the ASC 606 standard, we reported revenue of $619.6 million, up 7% compared to $577.9 million in the third quarter of 2017. And as a reminder, merchant commissions in certain third-party processing expenses are now netted against revenue, which resulted in a reduction in revenue of approximately $28 million in the third quarter of 2018 versus the prior standard.
 Also recall that in the third quarter of 2017, the GAAP numbers included approximately $2.2 million of revenue from our NexTraq business, which was sold in the third quarter of 2017.
 For the third quarter of 2018, GAAP net income decreased 22% to $157.7 million or $1.71 per diluted share from $202.8 million or $2.18 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2017. Included in the third quarter of 2017 was a net benefit of approximately $65 million from a gain on sale of the NexTraq business, partially offset by an impairment charge resulting from changes in our investment arrangement in Masternaut that caused a change in our accounting from the equity to cost method.
 Excluding approximately $0.69 per share positive impact of these items, net income per diluted share would have been up approximately 15%. Non-GAAP financial metrics that we'll be discussing are revenues excluding the impact of the new ASC 606 standard to provide comparable revenue amounts between periods and adjusted net income, which we sometimes also refer to as cash net income or cash EPS. A reconciliation of GAAP revenue using the new ASC 606 standard to the prior revenue convention is provided in Exhibit 7 of our press release, and adjusted net income to GAAP numbers is also provided in Exhibit 1 of our press release.
 Revenues in the third quarter of 2018, excluding the impact of ASC 606, were $647.5 million, up 12% compared to $577.9 million in the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted net income for the third quarter of 2018 increased 22% to $246.6 million compared to $202.8 million. And adjusted net income per diluted share increased 23% to $2.68 compared to $2.18 in the third quarter of 2017.
 We experienced a mixed macroeconomic environment in the third quarter of 2018 compared with the third quarter of 2017. Movement in foreign exchange rates were primarily negative, which most of the impact was from the Brazilian real, as the currency was roughly down approximately 20% from last year's levels. We believe foreign exchange rates negatively impacted revenue during the quarter by approximately $27 million. Fuel prices were mostly favorable during the quarter. And although we cannot precisely calculate the impact of these changes, we believe positively impacted revenues by approximately $14 million. And finally, fuel spreads had about a $3 million positive impact in the quarter.
 So in total, those changes had a negative net impact of about $10 million in our third quarter revenue compared with the third quarter of 2017.
 The impact of the macro changes versus the guidance we gave on last quarter's earnings call were slightly negative, as unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates more than offset higher fuel price, resulting in a net negative macro impact to revenue of approximately $1 million. Organic revenue growth improved to 11% overall this quarter. Most of our major product categories performed well during the quarter. As expected, our fuel card business was at 5% growth and would have been approximately 8%, if you exclude the negative impact of the GFN portfolio conversion in 2017 and Chevron in the quarter.
 To remind everyone, we started lapping the conversion impact at the end of the second quarter of 2018 and expect the fuel card category to exit the year in the upper single-digit range.
 The Corporate Payments category continued to perform well and was up 28% organically during the quarter. The growth in Corporate Payments was driven by both our Comdata and Cambridge businesses, both of which grew in excess of 25% in the quarter. The growth in this category was driven primarily by adding more accounts and more spend. 
 Our toll business had another great quarter, up 17% organically. The growth in this category was driven primarily by a combination of more new sales, stronger existing client base to growth due to the strengthening of the Brazilian economy and from our new usage-based pricing structure.
 Our lodging business was up 21%, driven primarily by an increase in room nights. We did still have about $500,000 benefit from FEMA room bookings during the third quarter and currently do not expect any material benefit from the recent hurricanes in the next quarter. The third quarter of 2017 also had approximately $2.5 million of the FEMA benefit. Excluding the FEMA benefit in both periods, the growth rate this quarter would have been approximately 28%. As a reminder, there was approximately $6 million in FEMA benefits in the fourth quarter of last year, which will cause a reported organic growth rate for our lodging segment to be -- potentially be in the low single digits in the fourth quarter.
 All in, we expect fourth quarter organic growth to be in our targeted range at approximately 8% to 10%. Included in the organic growth assumption will be some strengthening of the fuel category as we lap more of the GFN conversion issue and some moderating of the other nonfuel categories as we lap higher growth from fourth quarter of last year.
 I would remind you that organic revenue growth has been calculated -- adjusted for the macro impacts and assuming that ASC 606 was implemented in January 2017 in order to calculate organic growth using a consistent revenue standard in both periods.
 Now moving down the income statement. Total operating expenses for the third quarter were $338.5 million compared to $345.2 million in the third quarter of 2017. Included in the third quarter of 2018 was the impact of ASC 606, which netted approximately $28 million in merchant commissions and certain processing expenses against revenue. Excluding these impacts in both quarters, operating expenses would have been up approximately 7%. The increase was primarily due to acquisitions completed in the second half of last year.
 As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses were approximately 55% compared to 60% in the third quarter of 2017. Excluding ASC 606, operating expense as a percentage of total revenue would have been approximately 57% in the third quarter of 2018.
 Credit losses were $17 million for the third quarter or 6 basis points compared to $8.3 million or 5 basis points in the third quarter of 2017.
 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 3% to $67.2 million in the third quarter of 2018 from $69.2 million in the third quarter of 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the sale of the NexTraq business in the third quarter of 2017 and foreign exchange rates, which had a favorable impact on expenses.
 Interest expense increased 23% to $36.1 million compared to $29.3 million in the third quarter of 2017. The increase in interest expense was due primarily to increases in LIBOR and additional borrowing for the Cambridge acquisition and share buybacks.
 Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2018 was 33.6% compared to 38.1% for the third quarter of 2017. The 2018 third quarter rate included a $23 million true-up of our provisional transition tax liability, originally reported at the end of 2017 in conjunction with U.S. tax reform. If we exclude the impact of the transitional tax adjustment, the tax rate for the quarter was 23.4%, which is in line with our 2018 expectations.
 The reduction in the tax rate from 2017 was primarily due to the effect of U.S. tax reform, which went into effect on December 22, 2017. Also, the third quarter of 2017 rate was impacted by the nonrecurring gain realized in the sale of the NexTraq business and the Masternaut impairment charge.
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.19 billion in total cash. Approximately $264 million is restricted and consists primarily of customer deposits. As of September 30, 2018, we had $3.5 billion outstanding on our term loans and revolver and approximately $675 million of undrawn availability. We also had $931 million borrowed in our securitization facility at the end of the quarter, and we did not repurchase any shares of common stock in the third quarter. We currently have 629 million in total repurchase capacity available.
 As of September 30, 2018, our leverage ratio was 2.39x EBITDA, which is well below our covenant level of 4x EBITDA as calculated under our credit agreement. We intend to use our future excess cash flow to temporarily pay down the balance on our revolving credit facility and securitization facility and maintain liquidity for acquisitions and other corporate purposes.
 Finally, we're not a capital-intensive business, spending approximately $21.7 million on CapEx during the third quarter of 2018.
 Now, on to the update for the outlook for 2018. We are raising our 2018 guidance to reflect our third quarter results compared to our prior outlook. While there has been some improvement in exchange rates since our last guidance update, it continues to be volatile, especially in Brazil. We continue to believe that movements in foreign exchange rates will more than offset the continued impact of favorable fuel prices and be roughly in line with our guidance from the August earnings call. We remind everyone we expect that the macro will impact fourth quarter revenue by approximately $20 million to $25 million, which is currently reflected in our updated full year guidance. The good news is, as we did in the third quarter, we believe we can offset the unfavorable macro due to continued overperformance in some businesses, expected lower expenses and the impact from a lower share count in the second half.
 Additionally, for those looking for an update on the Chevron portfolio, terms for selling and transitioning the portfolio have been agreed to. The expectation is that we will start to transition the portfolio late in the fourth quarter and be complete early in the second quarter. We expect to receive proceeds of approximately $160 million from the sale. These proceeds will result in a taxable gain and are excluded from any of our guidance for 2018 to follow. And from a modeling perspective, we estimate that fuel revenue will be about $35 million lower in 2019 as a result.
 So with that out of the way, our guidance is as follows: Total revenues, including the adoption of ASC 606, to be between $2,390,000,000 and $2,420,000,000; net income to be between $695 million and $705 million; and as I just mentioned, this and all related amounts following do not include the gain from the Chevron portfolio sale. Net income per diluted share to be between $7.50 and $7.60; revenues excluding the impact of ASC 606 to be between $2,495,000,000 and $2,525,000,000; adjusted net income to be between $960 million and $970 million; and adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $10.40 and $10.50. And some of the assumptions we have made in preparing the guidance include the following: Weighted fuel prices equal to $2.95 per gallon average in the U.S. for those businesses sensitive to the movement in the retail price of fuel for the balance of the year; market spreads equal to the 2017 average; foreign exchange rates equal to the 7-day average as of October 7, 2018; interest expense of $140 million; fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately 93 million shares; adjusted tax rate of between 22% and 24% and no impact related to acquisitions or material new partnership agreements not already disclosed.
 With that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Quick question on the Corporate Payments growth acceleration. I know, Eric, you mentioned the new accounts in spending associated with those accounts. But could you just talk about the sustainability of this growth rate and sort of what we should look out for and how we should think about the growth rate of that segment? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes, Sanjay. There's 2 pieces to the growth. Obviously, we've got the Cambridge business and we've got the Comdata Corporate Payments business. The good thing about that business is all of the incremental spend or the vast majority of the spend is basically new accounts or additional spend on existing accounts that we already have. So really, really it's a very, very healthy business. It's also a pretty easy business to actually predict on a go-forward basis as most of the new revenue that's going to come our way in 2019 has already been actually sold, given the period of time it takes to onboard a new account. From an expectation perspective for next year, we're obviously in the middle of the budget process kind of as we speak so we don't have any, obviously, any final guidance numbers related to any particular business category. But I would expect that growth rate to kind of be in the mid-teens kind of next year as we are lapping some pretty strong growth rates in 2018. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Sanjay, it's Ron. Let me just add the -- remember the volume growth in the verticals I called out were around 20% to kind of the spend growth. So the other couple pieces in there is healthcare again, which goes the other way, which will tick us back a bit next year and probably a little bit less price. So if you said the numbers are well into the 20s this year, I'd say our number ends up where Eric said, probably 15-ish for 2019. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Okay, great. And just my follow-up, Ron, you mentioned you're active in the deal market and there's a pipeline. Could you just speak to anecdotally maybe to like the sizing of the deal that you're looking at? Because you seem to have a decent about of capacity. And just one clarification on that preliminary outlook you gave for revenues in 2019. Did you incorporate sort of the Chevron impact? Or was that organic ex that impact? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes. That was mostly, obviously, again, Sanjay, we're in the middle of the budget as we speak. We've gone through kind of the first pass of the budget so all indications are that on an apples-to-apples basis, our growth rates are within the guidance range that we've previously given into that kind of 7% or 8% to 10% range. But yes, that would exclude Chevron. 
Ronald F. Clarke: And, Sanjay, on the deal question, I've got it in front of me. So I think like we normally report, it's a mix. We've got 2 or 3 decent-sized deals, call it $400 million or $500 million-plus and then a handful, 3 or 4 kind of tuck-in deals, call it $100 million to $300 million. So those would be the 5 or 6 things I'm looking at that are the closest in. And as I mentioned at -- in the opening, they're all basically inside of the 4 categories. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: I want to ask on the organic growth, 11% this quarter. That's the highest we've seen in a couple of years and that's above the 8% to 10% you called out or that you previewed. Is -- what's driving the upside? I didn't quite catch what the upside is. And what brings the growth back down in the fourth quarter, understanding that fuel should improve as well in the fourth quarter? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Tien-tsin, it's Ron. So again, the couple of things, the 3 big nonfuel were all way up. I think toll was 17; Lodging, 21, 28. So those obviously were high. And then the sequential thing is gift. I called out in my comment that "even gift" got into the positive column of plus 4 in the quarter. If you remember, it had a super bumpy, kind of crummy Q2, which brought our overall organic number down and then again, fuel at 5. So that's the mix that gets the 11. I think the sequential change, honestly, is the gift being low to being a bit into the plus column. And then continuing, obviously, super good growth in the 3 non-fuels. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Right. And the fourth quarter, with fuel moving up, that's just maybe some normalization in the nonfuel piece to gets you the -- back to the high single-digits in the fourth quarter plus the gift normalizing, perhaps? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, exactly. So I'd say I don't have all those numbers in front of me, but we have fuel again kind of recovering, call it 8% in Q4, mostly again because we're finally lapping and hope to never speak of this GFN thing again. So that will be out of the number. And then some moderation as we've gone by some of the price. What I said to Sanjay, about think about corporate pay and stuff coming from kind of 25-ish down into the mid- to high-teens. So we'll see some of those numbers come back a bit in the 3 nonfuels. And I think we have kind of flattish to the prior year. So it's a little bit more of the same. It ticks down a couple because the other 3 won't be quite as high in Q4. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Understood. So just my follow-up, maybe to follow up on Sanjay's question, just on the acquisition and M&A pipeline. You haven't done a larger deal in over a year. You didn't repurchase shares in the third quarter. Don't know if you can say those are tied or not, but could we expect you to buy back stock in the fourth quarter here, if some of these deals don't materialize in fourth quarter? 
Ronald F. Clarke: I can say clearly at the screen that I'm looking at, in 48 hours, our window opens. That would be my comment to you. So our window will be opening soon here. Yes, at this price, you should expect we'll be looking to buy back stock. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. 
Darrin Peller: I just want to start off on the -- just, first of all, the timing on, the latest timing on Chevron's deconversion. Does your new fuel exit rate of 78% include the impact of this in the fourth quarter at all or sounds like you're not necessarily including it yet? And just if you can remind us the building blocks that get us to the, call it 7% to 9% growth where -- you talked about organically for 2019. I know some of it is just anniversary-ing the tough MasterCard deconversion, but what else -- just remind us what else is going to really drive that to be sustainable there? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Darrin, it's Ron. So the story is, we have finally landed the plane on Chevron and reached an agreement, and I'd say that in our forecast, we anticipate keeping the majority of that, call it probably 80% or 85%, in the quarter. And then obviously rolling off as you get into Q1 next year. So that's point one. And then point two, yes, the step-up is really mostly the GFN grow-over is gone. And the rest of the businesses, I'm looking at the page, are kind of what I called out. We've got some set of super high-performing businesses like the 4 international. They're all double digit. The [ NAB ] business, which is double digit. Even our MasterCard business getting positive again in Q4. So I'd say that as we finally lap 2 things not growing very well, but the organic print, I'd say we're pretty comfortable at 8 because it doesn't require really a lot of delta sequentially in what we're doing. 
Darrin Peller: Okay, all right, that's helpful. Just quick follow-up. I mean, we talked a lot about corporate. But quickly on tolls, I mean, that area, you had very good growth in '17 and pricing benefits, you're going to anniversary some of that. Just wonder in terms of 2019 if the RFID, what kind of traction are you going to have in terms of revenue contribution? It seems like you signed some good deals already. You announced McDonald's and others. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. So again, I'd say the toll outlook would be probably again midteens for 2019. And again, the drivers behind that would be the new sales channels. So again, most of our revenue is kind of tag-centric or active user-centric than -- more than it is transactions, so that number is growing. We expect it to grow a bit more next year. And then we have layered in a bit of incremental revenue next year in the plan for this Beyond Tolls set of things, primarily fuel but even a little bit, as we said, the fast food and even a tiny bit for the rental cars. So I think the plus or minus, call it 15 in tolls next year will be a function of the pace of this Beyond Toll network. So if we get out of the blocks faster and open it up sooner, we'll get some lift on the upside and if we get out of the blocks slower, open it up a bit slower, we'd see it maybe tick a bit down. So I think again, the headline for the call today with you guys is we like the prospect long term. We've gotten the partners to sign up. We've done the testing, like the McDonald's thing. They're over the moon from the tests and signed a contract with us to go to all 400 drive-through locations in the country between this quarter and next year. And so -- and same in the fuel. We have Petrobras beating the door down to sign the thing, so I think that the juicy 5 million users that are already kind of ready to go and show up at new parking lots and new fuel stations and new drive-throughs, I think it's a timing question more than a we will get the money question. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. 
Ashish Sabadra: My question, just wanted to go more high level. Thanks for the update on the growth initiative. As we think like in 2019, but more importantly 3 years out, as you make progress on these growth initiatives, how should we think about these contributions from the growth initiatives to your 8% to 10% organic growth target? Does that reinforce your confidence? And how should we think about the contribution to the growth? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Ashish, it's Ron. I think that is the $1-million question. I guess what I'd say is that the opportunity that it opens up, right, in each of the businesses, if you think about in fuel, the fact that the nonfuel spend among our existing customers is to 2:1 over fuel spend and you look at tolls where fuel is 10x the size of toll in Brazil, and you look at the ASAP, the Avid partnership thing, that size market is 2x to 3x the midsized market that we're attacking. And so I think the main headline is that we're reengineering these things to open up way more opportunity inside of the 4 businesses that we're already in. And so I'm not trying to hedge it but I think it's just -- it's a pacing question. It's how fast we can get those networks up in each of those cases and how fast we can get the incremental distribution pipes filled. But conceptually, this stuff should be pretty incremental to what we're doing because it's targeting new segments and/or adding more spend on the customers that we've already got. So I'd say stay tuned, as we roll and we'll give you a clearer view of the breadcrumbs, but we think [ in this ] case there was some consternation of getting the thing done so we did hold on to the thing, really call it for the full year. And so the good news, if there is any, is we can obviously deploy the $160 million to either buy back stock or buy earnings to replace it. And I think the second, there's a pony in every experience, is the growth rate is helpful. So even prior to that RFP going in a different direction, that private label is not a grower. And so in some ways as we lap this thing, as we leave next year, it actually will be helpful to growth. So if you look at the piece of paper for even this year, Chevron is declining for full year 2018 to '17. So the short answer is, we'll use the capital to replace some of the earnings. We'll have a growth lift on the other side and we'll likely work on our sales plans, maybe spend a bit more money to try to sell a bit more in 2019. We finally have gotten on the other side of the hiccup, so I think we're in a place to invest. We just opened a new telesales center, for example, in Phoenix that I'm looking to pour more money into, and we've got some digital investments that we can make. So it's likely, Ashish, that we'll spend more to sell more next year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. 
David Togut: Good to see the step up in client revenue retention in the quarter. That looks to be the best level in at least 2 years. Can you talk about the drivers of the higher revenue retention and whether you think that's sustainable into '19? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, David, it's Ron. I mean, again, it's kind of a point tick up sequentially, and I'd say the 2 main drivers of it are, one, improvement in the MasterCard file. So as we leave the compares against the conversion snafu, those retention numbers in MasterCard are getting better. And then second, I would say, is mix. So as our corporate pay and STP businesses grow and they're growing faster, they have higher retention levels innately than the fuel card business because again, they target larger accounts generally. So those would be the 2 drivers. It would be better MasterCard retention and improved mix to higher retention businesses. 
David Togut: And as my follow-up, can you talk long-term view about expansion in electronic toll roads in Brazil? That was part of your buy case on STP. And clearly we've got a new president in Brazil now. How does that affect the longer-term growth case for STP? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, it's a good question. So the good news is, there are, I believe, 2 toll roads. One, I think, is actually going up, going live this quarter that we're in and one next year. This rolls back to, I don't know, 3 or 4 years ago that those were bid on and approved, and I think there's finally one is live and one will be live. I think that's worth kind of 2% to 3% incremental toll revenue in the country of which will capture our RFPs. And then I'd say who knows? It seems like the guy that was elected is pro-business and maybe pro-privatization. As so certainly, pushing more toll roads as a way to obviously to generate income and keep taxes down would be an attractive thing to do. So I know that there's a bunch of bids that were sitting in a backlog, were kind of stuck, of roads that they were going to put tolls on. So I don't know, but I think the election, if anything, would be a plus to that. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. 
James Schneider: I was wondering if you can maybe provide a little bit of a forward outlook, in terms of where you plan to take the Corporate Payments business longer term with respect to accounts payable processing either, with respect to new verticals or new product types, such as some of the invoice products that are out in the market. And maybe just kind of give us a sense of to what extent the deals that are in your pipeline are in that area. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Jim, I wouldn't comment specifically on the exact deals in our pipeline. But obviously, any businesses that nest around our 4 product lines in our ecosystem are things or companies we know and obviously that we look at. So I'd say at the high level, look, the core business that we're on, kind of company size, $100 million to $300 million is, right. We're selling a ton. The thing is growing. The spend is growing 20%-plus, if you kick out the healthcare, which is shrinking. And so to Eric's point, we've already in the sense made that plan for next year because we made the sales. We just have to get it implemented next year. So we like the core business as it sets up. I think the big, big opportunity that some others have demonstrated is this downmarket full AP thing that we've been working on and modeling and finally launched that in our mind, it's just totally incremental to what we're doing because it targets accounts literally $50 million to $100 million or $50 million to $150 million in revenue where we take the entire AP file and do some different things for them. So I think as we get that thing lifted off, certainly we would look to acquire businesses that are in that space, but that would be the primary thing. We're going to keep getting behind the midsized accounts that we're on and we're going to find a way, either internally or through deals, to build a bigger position in the small market. 
James Schneider: That's helpful color. And then can you maybe just talk at kind of a broad macro level, the 1% same-store sales growth seems fairly healthy and consistent with what you have seen. But clearly, there was a lot of concern out there in the market that whether it's the transports or the industrials or these other kind of sectors that you're exposed to, there might be some softening from a macro perspective. So I'd just kind of be curious whether you're seeing anything on in terms of the tea leaves or any kind of the real-time transaction data that would suggest that things are softening there with respect to an end market prospective. And if so, in what areas? And if not, where is it getting better? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Again, it's a tough metric, Jim, for us to forecast because the number we provide is a composite of lots of businesses and lots of geographies in lots of categories. So I'd say that the 1%, I think we reported, Eric, 2% in the prior quarter, is really a loss of an account in SBS, JC Penney, which was not super healthy. So like always, we've got a mix of superstrong high-base growers like corporate pay, lodging and SNB is way up because of that digital tool. Australia was crazy high. Russia was high. STP, actually the business accounts, the non-trucking accounts were high. So we don't really see anything in the Q3 same-store that would indicate kind of any type of slowdown structurally, like in any vertical or any particular geography. So again, our -- the only thing that we saw was again, this one account in the gift card business that nicked it a little bit. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Oscar Turner with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. 
Oscar Turner: So first question is on the toll segment. It seems that you guys have pretty strong momentum with new partner signings in the non-tolls part. Just wondering what those partners have cited as the main value proposition. Is it speed or safety or what? And then based on what you've seen and test so far, how do you look at the revenue opportunity in non-tolls versus the core STP over the long term? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Oscar. I think you're right. So as you think about the obviously parking and fuel and even the McDonald's thing today, obviously one thing is just the convenience, to your point, of speed and security that people don't have to roll down their windows, there's cost reduction for parking, things, right, in not having 2 lanes but having one where one is automated, like you see on the toll and security in the case of fuel, where particularly females are fueling. They have a tendency in Brazil so not having to put the window down but just pulling up and having the thing automatically refueled. And I think another one I'd add is the McDonald's guy said that it also showcases them as innovative in payments. So like a lot of the fueling guys are trying to do mobile things or have your car, turn the pump on. And so, I think to get out in front as McDonald's and show,  hey, we're innovative. We've got the easiest ways to pay versus other fast food guys, would be another thing that the partners say. So I think they like it and then, they obviously love the fact that we've got 5 million users basically that we can help to direct and communicate with, right, and talk to. So those would be, I guess, the major benefits the partners see. And I think you're right, the evidence that they like those benefits is they're signing contracts with us. And the biggest ones, the biggest parking guy. We have 2 of the 3 biggest fuel guys. We have the biggest fast food guy by a factor of whatever, 5. So we're talking to the largest rental car company. So we're talking to the very biggest partners and signing the very biggest partners that they've got. 
Oscar Turner: Okay. And then second question, just a broader one on business mix. I just wonder if you could give some color on how you envision the revenue mix looking over the next few years, just given the strong growth we continue to see in nonfuel card businesses. Do you see a mix shift away from fuel? And then, I guess related, should we expect that those businesses come in more investment, whether it's organic or M&A, just given the relative under-penetration in those markets? So Corporate Payments, Tolls, et cetera. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean, I think the math, you guys are good at math. So I think the differential in the growth rates, at least that we're outlining this year and the last couple of years in some of these new categories, have enormous potential and those lines of business are growing faster. Obviously, it takes the nonfuel mix up, A. B, there's obviously a fair number of targets, acquisition targets, probably 3/4 of what we're looking at, I'm looking at this year is in nonfuels. I'd say it's probably pretty likely that we'll acquire things that are nonfuel. So the mix answer is, you look 3 years out, the 45% that we have is probably 40% or lower. But I would like to make one point on it, which is, we love -- I want to be super clear, we love that the fuel card business and we love it because it is incredibly protectable. And we have proprietary networks and their mass of barriers and the products are incredibly unique and it limits the number of people that can be in it. So it's just a different business model and structure than some of the other things. Maybe the markets aren't quite as big but they're plenty big. But the defensibility, in our mind, is super high in those fuel card businesses. So I don't want people to get -- hang up this call and go, oh, they only like the nonfuel businesses. We like the fuel business and we want to be in the fuel business and we'll keep buying businesses in the fuel business because it's a great business. And the profit margins are even better, Eric (sic) [ Oscar ], than our line average. 
Oscar Turner: Yes. 
Ronald F. Clarke: So don't take it that we're, "giving up" on the fuel card business. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. 
Glenn Greene: Just wanted to go back to the lodging segment. The 21% growth seemed like clean quarter, not really any meaningful FEMA benefit. Can you just sort of like give us a little bit more color on what's driving that? Was it all sort of the incremental growth from the online booking tool? And you also made a comment about, I may have missed this, but going from 15,000 locations to 25,000 locations. Can you clarify that? And also would it be reasonable to think this is still a midteens grower in '19? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. So the first one is what drove the growth here. You're correct, it was not much FEMA, virtually none. So all the growth really was 2 things. One, the small business selling way more than we're losing. We're selling, I think, 25% of the book and losing 10, so we're obviously adding way more business. And then two, what you mentioned, we're getting more business from the accounts that we previously had because they're taking more room nights with us. We think because of that tool, when we study the users of the booking tool versus the nonusers of the booking tool, that group's spend with us is growing faster. And then lastly, I think the big account business has gotten a bit healthier. We don't add many new accounts in the thing, but their room nights are up some and there was a while there a year ago where they were actually soft, so that thing's turned into the positive column. So I think those would be the 3. So no FEMA, more sales than we lose, more spend out of the people using the digital tool and a bit healthier big accounts. Yes, in terms of next year, do we like the prospects for that to be a midteens business? If you hack FEMA out, which we got a fair amount, particularly from the Houston thing, my guess is it would be probably high-teens and the FEMA would back it down into somewhere into the low- to the mid-teens. I mean, who knows if we'll have any FEMA in 2019? So we'd obviously plan 0. But it's an incredibly healthy business. And then the last thing you asked is the next extended network idea. We're going to bolt another 10,000 hotels onto our network in Q1. And so if you think we've got 15,000 now, when people run a search, we'll now basically put 40% more room nights up, and so we think we'll pick up incremental room nights from clients that are not finding the room choices that they want. And so we should see some lift as we head into Q2 and Q3. 
Glenn Greene: Okay. And then just quickly, I know it's an old topic but anything you can tell us in terms of coming to resolution on the gift card portfolio? What are the options you're looking at? Anywhere close to resolving that? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I feel a little bit like a broken record on this. So we are -- I know with this World Series concluding, 3 strikes, you're out. But we do have a new idea or a new structure that we're pretty far along with, with a couple of people. So this was a different thing we've been working on. So I'd say I'm hoping that I won't say this but by the next time that we talk that we'll have either found an answer to this or we won't. This is kind of our last idea. And so if we talk again and we don't get this idea to work, then we're in there retaining it. But if it works, it's quite attractive. It's a structure and an approach that allows us to retain a lot of the earnings and get the revenue growth issue out, and so it's an attractive idea if we can get it executed. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session as well as the conference today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2018 Q2  (2018-08-02 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder this conference is being recorded. 
 I would like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Jim Eglseder, Head of Investor Relations for FLEETCOR Technologies. Thank you, sir. You may begin. 
James Eglseder: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. By now you should have access to our second quarter press release and supplemental presentation, which can be found on our website at www.fleetcor.com under the Investor Relations section. 
 Throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than other companies' non-GAAP information. Quantitative reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today's press release and on our website, as previously described. Also, we are providing updated 2018 guidance on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, along with reconciliations. 
 Finally, before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements. This includes forward-looking statements about our 2018 guidance, new products and fee initiatives, expectations regarding business developments and acquisitions and statements regarding the unauthorized access to the company's system, including assumptions with respect to the investigation of the incidents to date. They are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore, you should not put undue reliance upon them. These results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K and on our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available on our website and at www.sec.gov. 
 With that out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay, Jim, thanks, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. Upfront here, I'll plan to cover 2 subjects. So first, I'll provide my perspective on the quarter along with some updated guidance for 2018. And second, I'll talk about the progress that we're making in positioning FLEETCOR for the long-term. 
 Okay. So onto the quarter. Our Q2 results were quite good. We outperformed our internal expectations in both revenue and earnings, reporting Q2 revenue of $585 million, up 15%, that's if you adjust 2017 for ASC 606. Our Q2 cash EPS was $257 million, up 29%. So 15% top line, 29% bottom line. So the last 3 quarters of cash EPS profit growth have been 28%, 28% and now 29%. So not bad. 
 The macro not particularly helpful this quarter versus our expectations. So although we enjoyed pretty good fuel prices in the quarter, FX worsened considerably, spreads narrowed a bit, interest rates rose and even our effective tax rate came in a bit worse than planned. So in total, these macro factors resulted in approximately $10 million of negative revenue impact and about $0.05 of negative cash EPS impact in the quarter versus our guidance. So the macro hurting our results a bit.
 Let me turn to organic revenue growth in the quarter, which penciled out at 9% in aggregate and just run through that. So first, fuel card organic growth improved to 5% from 1% in Q1. International fuel card growth was 8%. Inside of that, Russia grew 29%. Here in North America, our trucking fuel business grew 20%. Card lock business way up. So lots of good fuel card performances. Unfortunately, the offset remains our U.S. local and partner business still impacted negatively by last year's GFN conversion and the weakening Chevron portfolio. 
 Corporate Payments, very good quarter, up 20%. Inside of that, the construction vertical, up 30%. Our core virtual card business, our direct business up 24%. The payroll card business there, way, way up. Cambridge posted mid-teens growth. So really very solid Corporate Payments. 
 Toll, 20% in Q2. That was driven 5% by higher average tags or volume along with higher prices for our higher usage customers. 
 The trucker strike did depress transactions and spend about 5% in the quarter but had very little impact on Q2 toll revenue because of the subscription basis there. The new toll sales in the quarter good, up 16% over last year. 
 Lodging rocked in the quarter, driven by SMB room volume, which was up over 30%. That was helped by our digital booking tool. The large hotel segment remained healthy. The same-store there, plus 3, and the hotel tuck-in from last summer grew terrific, up over 30%. So lodging firing on all cylinders. 
 Our gift card business, not so good, posted a 19% decline in the quarter. Fortunately, the core transaction volume and processing revenue, which are ratable, did come in on plan and flat with the prior year. So all of the decline, all of the softness was attributable to some big card orders that got pushed into Q3. So our view is the decline is really just a timing issue and that SVS for the full year of '18 should be basically flat with full year 2017. 
 In terms of trends in the quarter, quite positive. New sales, new business up 14% versus the prior year. And inside of that, more new fuel card sales than ever before, so a record level of fuel card sales. Same-store customer growth positive at plus 2. Customer retention, again, above 90%, that makes 13 consecutive quarters of 90% plus. 
 We did repurchase about $300 million of FLT stock in the quarter. That brings our repurchases since 2016 to about $1 billion. Our board increased our buyback authorization in our last meeting by another $500 million. 
 We're also really delighted to be named to the S&P 500 index. Feels good to be recognized for a lot of hard work and consistent performance over a long period of time. 
 So look, the story of the quarter, good revenue and profit growth, improving fuel card organic growth and really good trends, good sales and good retention. 
 Okay. Let me transition over to our rest of year guidance. So today, we're raising our full year 2018 cash EPS guidance at the midpoint by $0.07 to $10.42. So the $10.42 updated full year guidance would result in 22% profit growth for full year 2018. 
 Important to note that this updated guidance assumes quite a bit weaker macro environment in the second half than we had thought, say, 90 days ago. We're now estimating approximately $30 million to $40 million of negative revenue impact rest of year, driven predominantly by the worsening FX, a bit more unfavorable interest rates, both of which will more than offset the favorable fuel price. 
 Despite the weaker macro, the fundamental performance should be pretty sound, though, rest of the year. We expect overall organic revenue growth in the 8% to 10% range in Q3 and Q4, and likely a 9% full year 2018 organic growth number. We do expect the fuel card organic growth to accelerate to about 8% by Q4 and our nonfuel lines of business to likely moderate into the mid-teens rest of the year as they lap some second half pricing and absorb some big contract renewals. 
 Okay. Let me shift gears and talk a bit about the positioning of FLEETCOR for, really, long-term sustainable growth. So a few areas. So first up is the portfolio or the sandbox in which we play. 
 So as most of you know, we started out as a pure fuel card provider and now look more like a diversified business payments company. So initially, fuel cards are now really a whole line of specialized business expense cards and networks. So in addition to fuel, toll, parking, hotel, food, payroll, even commuter cards. So a variety of spend categories. And then second, we've entered the Corporate Payments or general payables space with digital offerings to automate AP and even pay international AP. So this creates certainly a bigger sandbox that has a larger market potential and gives the company a much, much longer runway. 
 We're obviously doing well in the new diversified areas, newer categories. Our 3 nonfuel lines of business growing over 20% year-to-date. 
 We've still got more portfolio work to do. We hope to extend the geographies in which we play, specifically into Continental Europe and Asia. And we do continue to explore a new idea for SVS that could help accelerate the company's overall growth. 
 So look, lots of progress in structuring a bigger, broader and more diverse company. 
 Second area of progress is building a global sales machine. So we think sales is the single most important asset for a company like ours, and we've built a pretty big machine. We're now selling hundreds of millions of dollars of new business each year. And to us, that demonstrates winning. And we're doing it through a variety of sales channels, field reps, telesales reps, digital channels, third-party retailers and through a host of partners. We're also spending about $200 million in sales investment this year and getting pretty good productivity, pretty good efficiency from that. 
 We've rotated sales pretty hard to digital. In Q2, approximately 40% of all our global fuel card new sales were from the digital channel, so that is up substantially. We're making new investments this year in sales enablement. Those are ways to soften the beach to make selling easier. We're also investing in a new channel sales group that will explore sales opportunities with new partners, including merchant acquirers, insurers and even travel management companies. 
 So look, we've developed a pretty impressive sales asset, and we're continuing to build it out. 
 And then lastly, we're making pretty good progress on the new product front and customer experience front and have initiatives going on, really, in virtually every line of business. So in fuel, we've talked about our beyond fuel programs in our local and trucking business. Those take the form of our BuilderPro construction program, and in trucking, our on-road card. Both of those offerings are gaining traction now, and they literally double the revenue from a customer, so quite exciting. 
 We're launching what we call an AP or accounts payable companion card. That's designed to capture just the general AP spend that our fuel card clients would have. So early take rates on that companion card are good. 
 I mentioned before we've implemented a new simple fuel card UI for about 100,000 of our customers here and in the U.K. 
 In Brazil, we've launched fuel first. That's our program to take the toll technology and repurpose it for refueling and parking and to target non-toll users, which is a really big unserved segment for us. So we're in the process of building out the fuel acceptance network. So we've got 500 Shell stations, and now we're starting to build out the Petrobras accepting locations. We're working on a plan to double our parking lot acceptance, and we're even testing fast food payments. So the idea is to have extended networks beyond toll and target non-toll users, so a big opportunity. 
 In hotel, the digital booking tool that we've rolled out is now responsible for a third of all of our SMB hotel rooms booked growing every quarter. In corporate pay, we did launch officially our ASAP fully automated payable service for small business, so a complete AP outsourcing solution every bill that the company has. 
 And so all of these product initiatives expand again the market potential and allow us to serve unserved customer segments. 
 So look, in closing, yes, we're still a fuel card company at our core, about 45% of our consolidated revenue, but we're expanding the line of specialized business expense cards and networks clearly beyond fuel. We're building a pretty big global selling machine, and we're introducing a host of new products to open up customer segments. We're also still pretty good at acquisitions, finding them, buying them and improving them. 
 So all of these activities are aimed at building a bigger, better, stronger and more sustainable company as we go. So we think that bodes well. 
 All right. So with that, let me turn the call back over to Eric to pick up on the quarter. Eric? 
Eric R. Dey: Thanks. Before I get started on the numbers, I want to remind everyone that the company has adopted a new revenue recognition standard ASC Topic 606 via the modified retrospective method of adoption effective January 1, 2018. Under this method, 2017 results are not restated. In my revenue discussion to follow, as I did last quarter, I will talk about revenue in 2 ways. First, using a new GAAP convention, which compares 2018 using the new ASC 606 standard to 2017 using the prior standard. And then I will discuss revenue for 2018 and 2017 as if ASC 606 was never adopted, so you can compare revenues the way we have historically presented it. 
 Now on to the quarter. In the second quarter of 2018, on a GAAP basis under the ASC 606 standard, we reported revenue of $585 million, up 8.1% compared to $541.2 million in the second quarter of 2017. As a reminder, merchant commissions and certain third-party processing expenses are now netted against revenue, which resulted in a reduction in revenue of approximately $23 million in the second quarter of 2018 versus the prior standard. 
 For the second quarter of 2018, GAAP net income increased 35% to $176.9 million or $1.91 per diluted share from $131 million or $1.39 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2017. 
 Non-GAAP financial metrics that we are -- we were discussing are revenues excluding the impact of the new ASC 606 standard to provide comparable revenue amounts between periods and adjusted net income, which we sometimes also refer to as cash net income or cash EPS. A reconciliation of GAAP revenue using the new ASC 606 standard to the prior revenue convention is provided in Exhibit 7 of our press release, and adjusted net income to GAAP numbers is provided in Exhibit 1 of our press release. 
 Revenues in the second quarter of 2018, excluding the impact of ASC 606, were $608.3 million, up 12.4% compared to $541.2 million in the second quarter of 2017. Adjusted net income for the second quarter of 2018 increased 27.1% to $237.8 million compared to $187 million, and adjusted net income per diluted share increased 29.2% to $2.57 compared to $1.99 in adjusted net income per diluted share in the second quarter of 2017. 
 Second quarter results reflect the impact of a mixed macroeconomic environment compared with the second quarter of 2017. Movements in foreign exchange rates were primarily negative, particularly towards the end of the quarter. We believe it negatively impacted revenue during the quarter by approximately $6 million. Fuel prices were mostly favorable during the quarter. And although we cannot precisely calculate the impact of these changes, we believe positively impacted revenues by approximately $13 million. And finally, fuel spreads had about a $7 million negative impact in the quarter. 
 So in total, those changes were approximately neutral to our second quarter revenue compared with the second quarter of 2017. 
 Relative to our prior guidance, the macro negatively impacted our revenues by approximately $10 million in the quarter, driven primarily by unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates, mostly in Brazil during the latter part of the second quarter. 
 We delivered another quarter of solid organic growth, up 9% overall. Most of our major product categories performed well during the quarter. Our fuel card business rebounded to 5% growth and would have been approximately 8%, if not for the negative impact of the conversion issue for a portion of the MasterCard portfolio in 2017 and Chevron in the quarter. 
 As expected, we started lapping the conversion issue at the end of the second quarter of 2018 and are well on our way to the normal range of upper single-digit growth by the end of the year. 
 The Corporate Payments category continues to perform well and was up 21% organically during the quarter. The growth in Corporate Payments was driven by both our Comdata and Cambridge businesses, which continued to produce very good results. 
 Our toll business was up 20% organically due primarily to a number of growth initiatives implemented throughout 2017 and 2018 at STP. 
 Our lodging business was up 27%, driven primarily by an increase in room nights and continued FEMA rooms due to the impact from hurricanes. The FEMA impact contributed about 4% of the growth. 
 And finally, our gift business was down approximately 19% organically in the quarter due primarily to the timing of card orders. In the second quarter of 2017, we received a number of card orders, which we expect to receive in the third quarter of 2018. 
 So in summary, another very good quarter for our nonfuel businesses. 
 I would remind you that organic revenue growth has been calculated assuming that ASC 606 was implemented in January of 2017 in order to calculate organic growth using a consistent revenue standard in both periods.
 Now moving down the income statement. Total operating expenses for the second quarter were $320.2 million compared to $325.2 million in the second quarter of 2017. Including the second quarter of 2018 was the impact of ASC 606, which netted approximately $23 million of merchant commission and certain processing expenses against revenue. Excluding this impact, operating expenses would have been up approximately 5.6%. The increase was primarily due to acquisitions completed in the second half of 2017. 
 Additionally, we incurred $1.7 million of expenses in conjunction with the previously announced unauthorized access. 
 As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses were approximately 54.7% compared to 60.1% in the second quarter of 2017. Again, excluding ASC 606, operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue would have been 56.6% in the second quarter of 2018. 
 Credit losses were $14.5 million for the second quarter or 6 basis points compared to $14.7 million or 9 basis points in the second quarter of 2017. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 6% to $68.6 million in the second quarter of 2018 from $64.7 million in the second quarter 2017. The increase was primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2017. 
 Interest expense increased 39% to $33.2 million compared to $23.9 million in the second quarter of 2017. The increase in interest expense was due primarily to the impact of increases in LIBOR and additional borrowing for the Cambridge acquisition and share buybacks. 
 Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2018 was 23.5% compared to 31.2% for the second quarter of 2017. The reduction in the tax rate was primarily due to the effect of U.S. tax reform, which went into effect on January 1, 2018. As a result of U.S. tax reform, the federal statutory income tax rate was reduced from 35% to 21%. 
 The reduction in our effective tax rate due to the change in the federal statutory rate was partially offset by higher U.S. federal taxes related to the new GILTI tax and higher state income taxes, both resulting from U.S. tax reform. 
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1,185,000,000 in total cash. Approximately $266 million is restricted and consists primarily of customer deposits. As of June 30, 2018, we had $3,778,000,000 outstanding on our term loans and revolver and approximately $444 million of undrawn availability. We also had $939 million borrowed on our securitization facility at the end of the quarter. 
 We purchased approximately 1,450,000 shares of common stock in the second quarter for approximately $292 million. The board has authorized an additional $500 million increase in the share buyback authorization, and we now have $629 million in total capacity. 
 As of June 30, 2017, our leverage ratio was 2.34x EBITDA, which is well below our covenant level of 4x EBITDA as calculated under our credit agreement. We intend to use our future excess cash flow to temporarily pay down the balance on our revolving credit facility and securitization facility and maintain liquidity for acquisitions and other corporate purposes. 
 Finally, we are not a capital-intensive business, spending approximately $19.4 million on CapEx during the second quarter of 2018.
 Now on to the update for the outlook for 2018. We are raising our 2018 guidance to reflect our strong second quarter results compared to our prior outlook, even with the unfavorable macro that we now expect for the remainder of the year. We believe that negative movements in foreign exchange rates, mostly in Brazil during the latter part of the second quarter, will more than offset the impact of favorable fuel prices, producing an overall unfavorable impact on second half revenue of approximately $30 million to $40 million, which is reflected in our updated full year revenue guidance. 
 The good news is we believe we can offset the unfavorable macro through continued over performance in some businesses, expected lower expenses and the impact from a lower share count in the second half. Please refer to our second quarter earnings call supplement for additional information regarding our guidance.
 So with that out of the way, our guidance is as follows: total revenues, including the adoption of ASC 606 to be between $2,365,000,000 and $2,415,000,000; net income to be between $720 million and $740 million; net income per diluted share to be between $7.75 and $7.95; revenue, excluding the impact of ASC 606, to be between $2,470,000,000 and $2,520,000,000; adjusted net income to be between $960 million and $980 million; and adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $10.32 and $10.52. 
 Some of the assumptions we have made in preparing the guidance include the following: weighted average fuel prices equal to $2.88 per gallon average in the U.S. for those businesses sensitive to the movement in the retail price of fuel for the balance of the year; market spreads equal to the 2017 average; foreign exchange rate equal to the 7-day average as of July 1, 2018; interest expense of $135 million; fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately 93 million shares; a tax rate of 22% to 24%; and no impact related to acquisitions or material new partnership agreements not already disclosed.
 In terms of guidance for the third and fourth quarters, I want to remind everyone that the company's revenue and profits normally bill sequentially throughout the year, resulting in higher revenue and profit in the third and fourth quarters. For the third quarter, we are expecting adjusted net income per diluted share to be in the range of $2.60 to $2.70. 
 And finally, I want to give you an update on the unauthorized access reported last quarter that primarily involved the company's stored value solutions business. 
 As a reminder, the company took prompt action to investigate and terminate the unauthorized activity. The company through counsel properly engaged external experts and information technology forensics to assist in the investigation and the remediation and further enhancement of our systems to prevent future unauthorized access. 
 The company also contacted federal law enforcement and merchants known to be affected. The investigation has now been concluded and we can report that, based on the findings of the investigation, we believe the unauthorized access was limited to what was reported earlier. We do not expect the unauthorized access to have a material impact on the company's results of operations. 
 With that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. 
Robert Napoli: The guidance adjustments, where did you outperform fundamentally versus your expectations to enable you to adjust the guidance despite the negative macro? 
Eric R. Dey: Bob, this is Eric. Effectively, it's a number of things that's driving the second half revenue guidance. One, obviously, you heard us talk a little bit about the macro. Obviously, it's mostly FX rates in Brazil, which are causing the macro headwinds, so about $30 million to $40 million of unfavorable macro. Partially offsetting that is some over performance -- continued over performance in a couple of our businesses, more specifically like our Corporate Payments and our toll businesses, some of the businesses that have performed well through the first half. We're going to expect to see those businesses to continue to perform well in the second half. Then in addition to that, we're going to help offset the impact of that by -- we have lower expenses. If you recall, because our revenue is being impacted by unfavorable FX rates, our expenses are favorably impacted by unfavorable FX rates. So effectively, that's driving our expenses lower in the second half. So again, some -- about half of the favorability in revenue from FX, we're going to clawback in expenses in the second half. And then a little lower expense -- spending in some other areas as well. And then finally, we'll have a lower share count in the second half because of the share buyback. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Bob, it's Ron. Let me just add, it's about $0.15. We're absorbing about $0.15 of macro in the next 2 quarters. 
Robert Napoli: Okay. And just a follow-up question. As we look forward to 2019 and longer term, what are your thoughts around the organic growth by, I guess, fuel versus nonfuel? Or -- and if you wanted to break it down further by segment, but just thoughts on the organic revenue growth. And if nonfuel was growing faster, would that make it difficult to expand margins, I guess? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes. I think if you look at the last couple of years, Bob, we've been kind of high single digits in fuel and obviously better in the nonfuel. And so my comments earlier, I said we expect to moderate, call it, into the mid-teens in the 3 nonfuel lines. So we haven't started our '19 plans yet, but I would assume some mix like that going forward. And I think the upside could be these new add-on ideas that we have. If those get traction, a material traction sooner, we could get more lift. And then second, I think if we come up with some solution again to this SVS business, that would be another upside. So pre-budget, I'd say high single digits for fuel, teens for the other 3, maybe some acceleration from the new programs and then SVS is a wildcard. 
Operator: The next question is coming from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. 
David Togut: Pretty major announcement, Ron, calling out a significant expansion plan for Europe and in Asia. Europe, you've got the beachhead with Shell. But I'm wondering, as you look at Continental Europe and Asia, what are the major growth opportunities, both organically and then through M&A? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, David, we're kind of on the same drill of trying to get positioned either via partners or acquisitions, right, versus a greenfield build. I'd say the difference in messaging is we put not only more energy in the last 6 to 9 months in Asia, but we're seeing better feedback. So I'm trying to just put in people's minds that we haven't forgotten that part of the world, and that something may break our way on that side. So that's, I'd say, the difference is the Asia activity looks, I think, a bit more favorable than it did 6 or 9 months ago. 
David Togut: And is that mostly through M&A opportunity or organic growth? 
Ronald F. Clarke: It's not organic, so it'd either be a partner deal or an M&A deal. 
David Togut: Got it. And then Visa seems to be making a bigger push in Corporate Payments with the announcement with WEX, and I think historically, WEX have been principally MasterCard virtual payments as you had been. I'm just curious, does it make sense for you to bring in Visa just from a negotiating standpoint as you work with both of the networks in virtual payments? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Actually, a good friend of mine is the CFO of Visa, so it's a relationship that we have. I would say that we're pretty happy with the MasterCard people with the relationship with the deal. So I'd say, never say never. So we're obviously in conversations with them. But on the same imprint, pretty happy with MasterCard. I think last I looked, we're about half of all of MasterCard's U.S. virtual card business. And I think, we're the second-largest MasterCard issuer of commercial cards across every product line. So I think they like us because we're relatively important to them on the commercial side. 
David Togut: Got it. Quick final question. On the MasterCard topic, when do you fully lap the MasterCard card conversion from a year ago? And is there a point where it could even become a tailwind as you exit the year? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. It's Ron again. So I'm actually looking at that slide. So I'd say that it is still -- it was a negative in Q2 that we reported. It'll be a negative in Q3. And I'm looking at a page that says it'll turn positive in Q4. So part of the reason that we're outlooking, call it, plus 8% organic in the fuel in Q4 is that, that boat anchor is finally making the turn from the minus to the plus column. 
Operator: The next question is coming from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: I want to -- some good nonfuel performance, obviously. So on the toll front, how much of the business is tied to volume versus subscription? I see that toll transactions were down again, but revenues 20 plus again. So I was just trying to better model that, we've been getting that question a lot. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Tien-tsin. It's Ron. So again, the majority, not all, but the majority of the model there is tag-based. You pay a fixed amount for a tag for a month. And so what I called out is that our active tags that we bill for grew 5% in Q2 versus the prior Q2. So that's our best metric for volume. With that said, we do now get, call it, 20% of the revenue base is sensitive to transaction. And to your point, transactions, I think, that the prints were down a bit, but the strike, I think I mentioned, had about a 5% negative impact in transaction count. So we think trans would have grown, call it, a couple 2%, 3% in addition to the tag growth, which is really more selling. And then we obviously picked up incremental revenue from parking and fuel, which obviously is not total transactions and stuff. So I'd say, call it, half to pick a number out of 20, call it, 5 tags, a couple with tran and we get some revenue from that. And then the increment would be incremental fuel spend and incremental parking revenues. And then the other bounce is basically the program we put in place to get paid a bit more money from the high usage, particularly the trucking clients that use the product 80x a month and put a lot of spend on the program. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Yes. Okay. So it's pretty durable given that mix that you're describing. But how about -- just to bring it up at a higher level into Brazil. Has your outlook changed FX aside? I know it's hard thing to say in Brazil. But FX aside, what's going on with the election and the macro situation, has your outlook there changed? And what's your appetite to do more there organically or inorganically? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean, it's a good question. I guess it's still difficult. I don't have it in front of me, but I think the economy is still 0 to plus 1 or plus 1 for the full year. And I think things are a bit frozen, right, with the election in the fall. But I'd say we're still long on it. I've said it a million times that when you step way back, it's a big and early days payments market for everything that we do. One of our kind of comps is Edenred. Half their profits are in that market and not half of ours are. So I'd say that we still like it a lot because of the potential, Tien-tsin, and like others, hope we can get to the other side of this instability. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Okay. That's great. One last one. Sorry to take up a third question here. But SMB volume, you said was up over 30. The digital booking tool, which you mentioned last quarter was going to work. Could that -- is just the beginning? Could that actually improve from here? I'm just curious how sustainable that benefit was. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean, I think the fascinating -- that's another great question, the fascinating part is we've trained those 10,000 small companies for years now how to use the product, which is to call themselves or walk in. And even that group that's been around a long time, 1/3 of them use the booking tool. Of the brand-new accounts, for example, that signed up in Q1, 70% of all the SMB rooms were booked with the tool. So the new people that hear it from the get-go use it more. So the first thing is the mix alone will increase it sequentially. And then second, I think as we keep marketing it to the "old" customer base, we'll get more lift. So my guess as you roll out a year, you'll be at 50% or 60% of all SMB will be booked with that tool. 
Operator: The next question is coming from the line of Oscar Turner with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. 
Oscar Turner: My first question is on beyond fuel. When do you think that initiative can be incremental to the segment's revenue growth? And then can you give any color on adoption, like what percent of fuel card customers are eligible to use it? And how many of them have used it to date? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Oscar, it's Ron. I'd say I wish I could. I'd say that again, it's still a very early day. So if you think about it, we've got like 45% of our company is fuel cards and, call it, 10 businesses right around the world. And so we're introducing different flavors, different versions of this beyond fuel in different places. So we have different things happening here in our U.S. local business than we have in our U.S. trucking business, than we have in our U.K. business. So the first headline is the approaches for beyond fuel are a bit different depending on the specific line of business. But I'd say what the good news is, which I was trying to call out is, the early reactions are encouraging. So customers are taking up this AP companion card. We've got 3 of 14 still selling the BuilderPro construction card. So the problem is we're not long enough into the thing to turn it into a certain model yet. I'd say as we get closer to the end of the year and we build our '19 plans, ask me again and we should have a clearer thing. But that would be, back to Bob's question earlier, I think that's the delta for people that want to bet. That's the vector for us -- the pace of that could drive another point or 2 or 3 faster growth if that stuff could materialize faster. 
Oscar Turner: Okay. And second is just on the long-term profit margin outlook. You guys have outlined a number of growth initiatives that you're executing on, some of which required building out sales force or accepted networks. So how should we think about the ability to maintain your current profit margin levels even as you reinvest towards these growth initiatives? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. We like our chances of those inching up. I think you know us well enough. We're not in the charity press release business. We're in the profitable growth business. So we try to obviously onboard business that we can make money. And so I'd say the things that would cause us to have higher margins are; a, just the operating leverage. We still have 30%, 40% of the company's cost structure is relatively fixed, so we have that going for us. And then, b, these add-on things that you brought up earlier carry better margins because many of them are sold back to the same clients. And so obviously, the selling costs and servicing costs of an add-on is, by its nature, lower, and thus the add-on margins are higher. So I'd say those 2 things bode well for higher margins. And then I think just pace of growth and investment goes the other way, right? If we decide to step up sales investment or even more IT or innovation investment. So I'd say, if you net those 2, our forecast over the next few years would be to keep ticking it up positive a bit. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from the line of Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. 
Ashish Sabadra: To bring solid growth in the fuel card business from 1% to 5% and you're talking about 8% growth for the fourth quarter, if you could just -- obviously, the headwinds are coming off, but can you also talk about the sales traction that you've seen here? Like we run the same [ circuit ] on this, on the fuel card specifically. And then also, in the same light, if you can talk about the Casey run, how should we think about it? What really drove that win? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Ashish, on the first part of the question, I'd say our confidence in the acceleration is mostly what you said, which is, okay, the print for this quarter was 5% and we're outlooking 8%. I think David asked a bit ago -- asked me about GFN and I said it was a negative impact in Q2 and our plans are for that to turn the other way. So a lot of the acceleration from 5% to 8% is literally just moving that boat anchor aside. With that said, I hope you didn't miss that we sold more fuel card business globally this past quarter than ever, ever in the history of the company, a record level of it. And so assuming our retention or attrition stays kind of where it is, retention of 90%, obviously, the adding of incremental fuel sales will help lift that thing above 8%. So to us, it's get the boat anchor aside so the growth is clean; b, pick up the sales volume, which we did again in the quarter; and then third, Oscar's comment about the beyond fuel, get the beyond fuel to take. Those are the 3 plans, if you will, to get this thing back to an attractive number. On Casey's, your part 2 question, I think you asked timing or size or both? 
Ashish Sabadra: Both and also what drove the -- what drove that win? What are the criteria that Casey was looking for in your product that drove that win? 
Ronald F. Clarke: I got you. So first on the why us. I think all of these partner private label things have a similar screen. They have a, "Hey! Can you do it? Can you operate the thing?" So I think, there's a few of us that have the systems and the people to actually be able to do it and not goof it up. So they would look at SLAs of our other partners, reference us that we can do the work. Then two is volume or growth that they believe that we can sell, that we have selling systems that can work. And then three is obviously the price. And so I'd say those are the 3 main criteria. And so I think us versus others that did probably check the box on the first one. Obviously, other people in the space, WEX or Citibank can do cards. And then I think that the view of our ability to grow the volume and whatever our price proposal was would be the 2 things that caused them to pick us. In terms of timing, we're looking at that conversion starting in Q4 and running into the beginning of next year. And although we don't give individual client revenues, I tell you, it's a single-digit millions annualized contract. 
Operator: The next question is coming from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: A question on the M&A and new partnership front and whether or not you guys are getting closer to anything on those fronts. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Ron again. So on the M&A front, I think I mentioned on the last call. We're actually -- we were on the 5-yard line with something we decided no on, so something that was close we kind of kicked out. But I'm looking at the list in front of me. I'd say that we've got 3 or 4 deals that are active, what I use the term, they're in the works now. Looking at them, they're call them, $200 million to $400 million-ish in size, and then there's one larger deal. So I'd say that nothing we're going to announce in the next 30 days, but things that were mid and getting layered on right now. On the partner front, probably the same. I got that page in front of me. We've got a couple of things here in the U.S. We've got something in Europe. We've even got something in Brazil. But again, I've been wrong so many times forecasting the timing of those. I'd say it appears again that we've got 3 or 4 partners that have an interest in maybe doing something, but it's not late enough for me to give you guys a steer that it will be this year. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Got it. And just to follow up on, Ron, your response to Tien-tsin's question on STP. When we look at how much of the Brazilian market has your tags, I guess Brazilian vehicles have your tag, what's the penetration rate of those tags into that market? And so what's the growth opportunity there? 
Ronald F. Clarke: So there's a couple of ways to look at it. We look at the thing in terms of total toll spend, so what's the total take from every toll booth in Brazil annually in real and then how much do we process or collect. And I think, that number in front of me, but I think it's around 60% of all the toll money that's collected in a year is collected by us. So I'd say that we're moving down the curve. We sell about a million new tags per year. Again, we've got about 5 million active holders here in Q2. We sell about a million new ones per year. So I'd say that we're moving down the curve of lighter users. Obviously, anyone on the toll, on the highway, they're going 100 times a month already have our tag. And so we're more likely to get someone that's going 5x or 3x next. So I'd say the big idea, which I don't know if I communicated it well or not, but the big, big idea there is to take that technology and the relationships we have with fueling and parking and go to the other 35 million vehicles that don't go on the highway, that just go around the cities and like park in the garages and go to Shell stations and Petrobras stations. So when we look at that and the early returns on it are people like not stopping and paying for parking when they go to a mall there and yet the companies only offer that service so far to people that are toll guys that go on the highway. So when we bought the company, our idea was we're not going to be a toll company. We're going to be a toll technology or payment company. So the message you guys ought to queue on is, how fast can we start to add users that are not toll users, that want to use fuel and parking in particular. And I'm telling you, if that works, it's 5 to 10x the market potential of the thing that they built. And again, we built a massive distribution system, almost 2,000 people in the field selling. We've turned on the digital. We've got third-party retail now. And so we've have relationships with the 3 biggest gas station fueling retailers in the country. And so we bring a fair amount to chasing this thing down. That's the growth. That's the growth. 
Operator: The next question is coming from the line of Darrin Peller of Wolfe Research. 
Darrin Peller: Just first on the second quarter, if you can break down again the 5% fuel growth has been, excluding the GFN issue and Chevron in the [indiscernible]. And just to be clear, wasn't there some element of pent-up demand flowing through now or shouldn't there be from the MasterCard product being kind of held off during this process that I would think would show up in full swing in Q3? Just you were saying now that the growth rate would reaccelerate up to 8% plus or I guess should we expect 8% plus in third quarter? 
Eric R. Dey: Darrin, yes, if we exclude the impact of the GFN conversion issue and Chevron, the fuel card growth category would have grown around 8% organically. So again, it's in line with the guidance that we previously gave last quarter that growth rates are going to start accelerating in the space. And again, we're going to start exiting at a -- we're going to clear the GFN issue particularly as we get to Q4, we'll have a cleaner kind of 8% or so growth rate in that quarter as we exit the year. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Darrin, it's Ron on the part 2 question. Hey, you got a bunch of closer retail, so you got a bunch of hot bread lines with people at the door coming in. I'd say again that toe stubbing we did with GFN, not only impacted the customers that were on GFN, but hurt the productivity big time of our sales force. We've turned them into service reps for, oh, my God, I don't know, 4 or 5 months, yes, 4 to 6 months, trying to help clients they had sold when the thing was broken and stopped. And so it's been a way longer recovery of getting that group of people back, a. And then, b, because we thought the GFN platform was going to be the platform, a number of the new products we had built only ran on that platform. So I made the decision not to go forward with that and put those new products on that platform but to put them back on the old platform we had, so that took us another 3 or 4 months to kind of reengineer that, so adding the salespeople selling new things that they didn't have confidence in. And so it's not really a pent-up demand. I really view it as a recovery that finally, we opened a brand-new telesales center in Phoenix this past quarter mostly to get away from that pain that the people -- a couple hundred people here lived through. I wanted a clean, brand-spanking-new group of people that hadn't been through it. So I'd say that the way you should think about it is every quarter from now, we need to be building sales volume for that MasterCard product and getting farther away from that problem a year ago. 
Darrin Peller: All right. Just a quick follow-up and then I'll leave it at that. Corporate Payments is still an area that we're obviously excited about. The sales pipeline continues to be so strong there. I know you have tougher comps in pricing, but I guess I just wonder why that business wouldn't go back to even 20% even if it takes a quick breather in the mid-teens. Is that -- am I thinking about this fair? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I think you are, and I think we've been with you since we started talking about this that we're huge fans of that category because of the size of it. I think the biggest issue for us, Darrin, was the structure of the thing. So when we bought that business initially, whatever size it was, it had 2 pretty big parts of its revenue. It had health care, which was a 1/3 or 40% of the business when we bought it, and it had a fair amount of partners and resellers in it, call it another quarter or third, so 50% or more of the business was that. Will those 2 segments keep going the wrong way even 3 years later. The health care business continues to decline even in Q2, and so it sits inside of that 20% plus. Still, health care was minus, although it was smaller. And second, we kept getting repriced on renewals of the big reseller partner. So even though the volume goes up, we get less money. So what I'd say to you is, the non-health care and non-partner business is probably growing 35% just to pick a number. And so what I'd say is we are -- we're obviously -- the guy running, and we were taking the business away from these 2 things that I'm saying that were not my favorites to verticals that we like, like construction, media and just general AP. And so once we kind of ring through the other side of this, the non-health care or non-reseller piece will be smaller parts, and you'll see to your point a 20% plus business going forward. How long it's going to take us to get that thing completely ironed out, it'll be sometime in the next year would be my guess. So it's effectively, remaking that business in flight is what we're doing. 
Operator: The next question is coming from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. 
James Schneider: I was wondering if you can maybe kind of address the same-store sales trends you've seen. I think you talked about up 2 in the quarter. Can you maybe talk about where you think that's kind of going up, down or sideways as we go forward and maybe any puts and takes in terms of industries within that? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Jim, it's Ron again. I'd say like we always say, we're not super smart in terms of the forecasting of same-store and GDP and stuff, but we have seen certainly in the U.S. now at least 3 or 4 quarters in a row that have been in the plus column. And this Q2 that just finished, we had super health in lodging, in corporate pay stays and in Russia, those 3 were way up in terms of growth of the existing customer base. So again, in our plans and the guidance we gave you, we're thinking the things kind of where it's been, kind of 1% to 2%, I think is what Eric and I modeled for the rest of the year. But again, it's not a metric that's really super easy to forecast. 
James Schneider: Completely understand, but it's helpful color. And then maybe, as a follow-up. Can you maybe just talk about kind of with Cambridge in almost a year in the rearview mirror, your overall approach to the accounts payable market, whether your -- kind of how satisfied have you been with that acquisition so far? And then going forward, from an M&A perspective, what do you think you might want to actually add more assets to bolster that AP portfolio either in terms of the size of business or anything else? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. That's a really good question. I know lots of people maybe even on this call for some reason don't love the international payments FX business. Maybe there're some players out there that haven't done as well, but we're delighted. I told the CEO earlier this week coming up on a year that we are so happy we bought his company, their company. It got off to a bit of a slow start because I'm working on really too many things, but they got through that. They've grown mid-teens plus the last couple of quarters. Our outlook in good growth. The sales are way, way up, 25%, 30% up over the prior year. So I'd say at the highest level, we are really happy that we're in the space. Number two, we're starting to see some synergies from the cross-selling to the tune of $4 million or $5 million of new sales, we're expecting as we exit this year from our Comdata people selling the Cambridge International pay people. So that makes me -- us feel good about the relatedness of the businesses that the Cambridge clients obviously pay domestic AP too, along with international AP. And so we like the fact that we're in both of those. And then last thing I'd say is this whole AP automating and digitizing AP, we think -- I think, it's just -- it is a massive opportunity. And I worked at ADP for almost 10 years and half the expense structure on the planet is people and the other half is vendors. And so building the "ADP of AP" is a theme we have in the company that we probably will take bigger positions in this space over the coming years. We like it a lot. 
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Peter Christiansen with Citibank. 
Peter Christiansen: Just 2 quick ones. First, your competitor this morning was shipping -- well, at least playing with our guidance a little bit as it relates to the Chevron transition. Looks like timing might be pushed off a little bit there. Can you just remind us, how you're factoring that into the outlook? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes. Peter, this is Eric. Yes, we're now thinking we'll probably have that portfolio for the remainder of 2018. So we've kind of built that in. We originally were forecasting to have it kind of mostly through the third quarter. We'll probably now have it mostly through the fourth quarter, then we'll transition away from it as we get in the next year. 
Peter Christiansen: That's helpful. And then the lodging business is doing fantastic. And just maybe commentary on -- we're seeing more and more articles on this -- on the trucker shortage here in the U.S. It seems to not be impacting the lodging business at all, but any general comments on if you're seeing any improvements there, either on the fuel card side or in the lodging side. 
Eric R. Dey: Well, on the lodging side, I mean, clearly, we're seeing increases in volume all over the portfolio. As we said early on, we're focusing more downmarket where there are smaller fleets in an area where that business has traditionally not sold in. So we've been extremely successful, and it's an area that's very underpenetrated in this space. So we've seen a lot of success, and we think we're going to continue to see a lot of success. And now adding the digital tool, booking tool now added even more incremental rooms to the business as truckers are starting to use that tool a lot to book their new reservations and it's business that we're gaining that we used to, kind of, lose a little bit of in the past. So we're very, very bullish on the continued success of that business going forward. 
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Matthew O'Neill with Autonomous Research. 
Matthew O'Neill: Ron, I was hoping I could follow-up on a comment you made in your prepared remarks around sales channels and working with new partners like merchant acquirers. I was just curious kind of what the opportunity is there, who and how are you working together and any other details you could provide on that? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. That's a really good question. I think that I'm friends with Jeff Sloan of Global and Frank, so I know both of those guys and their businesses. So I think the new news for us is, call it, over the last 5 or 10 years, those companies have signed up way more kind of service businesses, think of a plumbing or construction person going out to a house and getting paid with a card now instead of billing. And they're not super important accounts to an acquirer because their volumes are relatively low, but they could be super important accounts to us because they buy more fuel than they run credit card transactions. So I'd say the opportunity that we're exploring is kind of leveraging their channel in their existing client base that's in the service-centric kinds of businesses to take some of our card products. So our products fit some of their customers, and both of those companies are quite used to partner work and kind of working obviously, for example, with banks and ISOs and bars and stuff. So I think it's right in their wheelhouse to maybe work with someone like us. So that's the idea, is to use of their relationships and customers and channels and maybe put some of our product line in. 
Matthew O'Neill: Got it. And would they think about working the relationship in the opposite direction as well potentially? Or is that premature? 
Ronald F. Clarke: They would. They both are smart guys, and they had some reciprocal ideas of some ways that we could help them. I mean, on that point, just this idea we talked and I guess, Peter said in the last call about winning and people talk a lot about nameplates and stuff, this is to remind people. We sold 30,000 new business accounts in Q2, 30,000 new businesses joined our portfolio. And so for us, this word winning is not a name of a company. It'd be a long list for us to name who we're winning, but I want to make sure people leave the call that in our view, that's winning, selling more new business than you ever had and selling diversified business that you can make a buck on is our idea, so just an FYI. 
Operator: It appears we have no additional questions at this time, and this does conclude today's teleconference. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for your participation, and you may disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2018 Q1  (2018-05-03 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the FLEETCOR First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And the conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]
 I would now like to turn the conference over to Jim Eglseder. Please go ahead. 
James Eglseder: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. By now you should have access to our first quarter press release and supplemental presentation, which can be found on our website at www.fleetcor.com under the Investor Relations section. 
 Throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than other companies' non-GAAP information. Quantitative reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today's press release and on our website, as previously described. Also, we are providing updated 2018 guidance on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, along with reconciliations. 
 Finally, before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements. This includes forward-looking statements about our 2018 guidance, new products and fee initiatives, expectations regarding business development and acquisitions and statements regarding the unauthorized access to the company's systems, including the assumptions with respect to the investigation of the incident to date. They are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore, you should not put undue reliance upon them. These results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K and on our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available on our website, as previously discussed, and at www.sec.gov. 
 With that out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay, Jim, thanks. And as always, thanks to everyone for joining the call this afternoon. So upfront here, I'll plan to cover on just 2 subjects. First, I'll provide my view of our Q1 results, along with our guidance for 2018; and second, I'll share a bit of an update on our growth initiatives and business development initiatives. 
 Okay. So on to the quarter, which was quite good. We reported Q1 revenue of $610 million, up 17%. And that's reported under the previous accounting standard 605, so it can be apples-to-apples. We reported Q1 cash EPS of $250 million. That's up 28%. So 17% top line, 28% bottom line. The macro in Q1 basically, as expected, so no real impact on our numbers relative to guidance. Revenue, really, across the board finished better than we expected. Our organic revenue growth finished at 10% overall for the quarter. Our fuel card line of business reported 1% organic growth. That was significantly impacted by the GFN portfolio and Chevron portfolio. And if you exclude those 2 components, the remainder of the fuel card business grew 7% organically. And we do expect a bit more acceleration probably in the 8% to 10% range. 
 Our 3 nonfuel lines of business grew in excess of 20% in the quarter for the second consecutive quarter. Corporate pay, up 25%, primarily as the health care portion of that business shrinks, is now about 11% of the corporate pay business. Also, we enjoyed a massive sales flow-through into revenue in our construction vertical. Construction spend up 34% in the quarter, so very healthy. And our payroll card business up pretty significantly. 
 Lodging, up 38% in Q1. About 1/3 of that driven by the FEMA continuing room nights, but 24% volume growth in our core small business segment. So we continue to make new sales there, and we've introduced a new digital booking tool that's lifting room volume. We did also capture some synergies in the quarter from the hotel tuck-in that we did last fall. 
 And then finally, in our Brazil tolls business, up by 22% in the quarter. We enjoyed the flow-through of some of the new pricing actions, a bit stronger Brazil economy and some incremental sales from our new third party and digital channels. 
 Fuel card revenue represented about 44% of our overall revenue in Q1. 
 In terms of business trends in the quarter, quite strong. Our same-store sales improved to 3%, driven by strength in lodging, corporate pay and our Brazil and Russia businesses. 
 Customer retention, 91% overall. That's 12 consecutive quarters of 90%-plus retention. And new sales or new bookings grew 18% versus the prior period. 
 So look, the story of Q1, revenue pretty strong, better than expected, and our expenses, a bit lighter than planned because we underspent the Tax Act investment. So good numbers and good fundamentals. 
 Okay. Let me transition over to rest of year guidance. So today, we're raising full year 2018 cash EPS guidance from $10.20 to $10.35 at the midpoint. That reflects a $0.15 Q1 beat to our initial expectations. We do outlook rest of year macro in aggregate to be in line with our initial expectations, although the individual components will move around. So fuel price will be a bit better. FX will be a bit worse. Interest rates will be a bit more unfavorable, but again, in aggregate, really, a push against our expectations. 
 Even though Q1 revenue and profit exceeded our expectations, our rest of year plan or guidance had already assumed a pretty significant sequential revenue increase in Q2 and Q3. And we do now expect to start expensing the Tax Act investments in incremental sales and IT, starting really kind of now in Q2 and continuing through the balance of 2018. 
 In terms of thinking about rest of year revenue growth expectations, we expect the fuel card revenue to accelerate again into the 8% to 10% range, if you exclude the impact of GFN and Chevron. The couple of drivers there are some new programs, something we call zero emissions and fraud protection that were introduced as free trial that will roll over to pay programs. We're going to go live with some third-party card acceptance, which will boost volume in our proprietary networks. And we're seeing an acceleration in our Russia business to the tune of 40% volume and revenue growth. So those things should add to a bit of acceleration in fuel card. 
 We do expect the nonfuel lines of business to pencil out in the high teens the rest of year, mostly because they'll lap some of the pricing initiatives we implemented in the second half. 
 Okay. Let me transition over to some of our growth and business development initiatives and start on the product side. So first, beyond fuel initiative. We launched a new universal trucking card to some of our largest over-the-road fleet clients. So this new product allows drivers to use their personal monies, think per diem or payroll at virtually any class of merchant. So they don't have to withdraw their monies as cash. So we're seeing the drivers now use this card at a variety of merchants, generates interchange for us and is resulting in almost a doubling of our monthly card revenue among the clients that have adopted it. And as importantly, the drivers do love it. 
 Second, our Brazil fuel-first, our card-less refueling program, we announced today the signing of Petrobras or BR stations, an acceptance agreement to that program. So that now allows us to expand beyond Shell. We'll have Shell and BR brands in locations. And so as those locations get rolled, we think it will provide a great lift to that program. 
 In the lodging segment, I did mention digital booking. We finally offered digital booking to our small account segments starting last year. And in the first quarter, 1/3 of all small business lodging rooms were booked digitally, up from really 0 the prior year. And that usage has resulted in about a 10% lift in room nights -- incremental room nights from that group of users. And honestly, the users are more satisfied with the service. 
 Now lastly, we began implementing a new simple user interface, think smartphone kind of interface, into our U.S. and U.K. fuel card clients. So we put about 70,000 clients on so far. Expect that to get to about 180,000 clients by end of year. So really a terrific reaction to a new simpler way to interact with us and obviously allows administrators of the program to do more self-service. 
 So the point here, we are continuing to deliver some new product advances, new product enhancements that increase utility to our clients. 
 Okay. Lastly, let me briefly update you on some of our partner and acquisition progress. So on the partner front, we did sign an amendment with Shell to extend the term of our 11-market European program with them, which is good news. And we've begun a new program with Uber, a new freight program that's being piloted, where Uber's trying to connect truck drivers to shipper loads, so a really interesting kind of partner opportunity. We are also working a couple of small new partner deals that I'd say are getting relatively close. 
 On the acquisition front, we announced a bit earlier a small minority investment in a company called P97. Their charter is to bring mobile payments to the petroleum industry. So the P97 solution enables gas station retailers to accept mobile payments, both at the pump and in-store, working through the existing equipment -- point-of-sale equipment and cash register systems with really little to no retrofit, which is a big deal. 
 So in addition to an investment in P97, we also signed a commercial agreement to use their technology for our own U.S. fuel card programs. So we hope to accelerate mobile usage among our own commercial client base. 
 Also, on the acquisition front, we took a look at our newest acquisitions, those from 2016 and '17, of which there are 4. So STP, Cambridge, CLS and the Russia Gazprom deal. Those 4 businesses had a combined Q1 2000 EBITDA that's up 39% versus Q1 2017. So the point, we continue to be pretty good at designing and implementing profit improvement initiatives within our acquired assets. We are also working on a couple of small acquisition tuck-ins, I'd say also getting into the late stages. 
 So look, in summary, we're off to a very good start. Our revenues and profits are ahead of expectations. We've had an outlook of cooperating macro environment. We've got solid same-store retention and new sales trends. We're making some advances in our products. We're enjoying strong profit growth in our 4 most recent acquisitions, and we're raising 2018 guidance to $10.35, which would reflect a 20%-plus cash EPS growth for the year. 
 So with that, let me turn the call over to Eric to provide some additional detail on the quarter. Eric? 
Eric R. Dey: Thank you, Ron. 
 Before I get started on the numbers, I want to remind everyone that the company has adopted the new revenue recognition standard ASC Topic 606 via the modified retrospective method of adoption effective January 1, 2018. Under this method, 2017 results are not restated. 
 In my revenue discussion to follow, I will talk about revenue in 2 ways: First, using the new GAAP convention, which compares 2018 using the new ASC 606 standard to 2017 using the prior standard. Secondly, I will discuss revenue for 2018 and 2017 as if ASC 606 was never adopted in 2018 so you can see revenue the way we have historically presented it. I plan to discuss revenue using both conventions for the rest of 2018. 
 Now on to the quarter. For the first quarter of 2018, on a GAAP basis, using the new ASC 606 standard, we reported revenue of $585.5 million, up 12.5% compared to $520.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. Using the new ASC 606 standard, merchant commissions and certain third-party processing expenses are netted against revenue. This new standard resulted in a reduction in revenue of approximately $24 million in the first quarter of 2018 versus the prior ASC 605 revenue recognition standard and will have no material impact on net income. 
 The revenue from our North American segment increased 10.4% to $364.3 million from $329.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. Revenue from our International segment increased 16.1% to $221.2 million from $190.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. For the first quarter of 2018, GAAP net income increased 41.4% to $174.9 million or $1.88 per diluted share from $123.7 million or $1.31 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017. 
 Non-GAAP financial metrics that we will be discussing are revenues, excluding the impact of the new ASC 606 standard to provide comparable revenue amounts between periods and adjusted net income, which we sometimes also refer to as cash net income or cash EPS. A reconciliation of GAAP revenue using the new ASC 606 standard to the prior revenue convention is provided in Exhibit 7 of our press release, and adjusted net income to GAAP numbers is provided in Exhibit 1 of our press release. 
 Revenues in the first quarter of 2018, excluding the impact of ASC 606, were $609.7 million, up 17.2% compared to $520.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted net income for the first quarter of 2018 increased 26.2% to $233.5 million compared to $185 million in the first quarter of 2017. And adjusted net income per diluted share increased 28% to $2.50 compared to $1.96 in adjusted net income per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017. 
 First quarter results reflect the impact of a positive macroeconomic environment compared with the first quarter of 2017. Changes in foreign exchange rates were primarily positive and we believe impacted revenue during the quarter by approximately $9 million. Fuel prices were also mostly favorable during the quarter, and although we cannot precisely calculate the impact of these changes, we believe positively impacted revenues by approximately $9 million. And finally, fuel spreads had about a $1 million favorable impact in the quarter. 
 So in total, those changes impacted our first quarter revenues by approximately $19 million and adjusted net income per diluted share by approximately $0.14 versus the first quarter of 2017. Also, the macro was mostly in line with our prior guidance. Fuel prices were a little favorable, and spreads and foreign exchange rates were a little unfavorable, so no meaningful impact from our prior guidance. Organic revenue growth, even after adjusting out the positive impact of the macro environment, was approximately 10% for the first quarter of 2018. Organic revenue growth has been calculated assuming that ASC 606 was implemented in January of 2017 in order to calculate organic growth using a consistent revenue standard in both periods. Most of our major product categories performed well during the quarter. 
 Our fuel card business was negatively impacted by the MasterCard portfolio conversion in the first quarter of 2017 and lower sales investment in the Chevron portfolio, which has impacted volumes, resulting in organic growth in this category of 1%. Excluding the impact of the MasterCard portfolio conversion from prior year and 
 Chevron, we believe fuel card organic growth would have been approximately 7%. We expect that organic growth in the category will be impacted until we lap the MasterCard conversion issue at the end of the second quarter of 2018 and until we transition the Chevron portfolio. Excluding these items, we believe growth rates will trend toward the mid- to upper single digits. 
 The Corporate Payments category continues to grow well and was up 25% organically during the quarter. The growth in Corporate Payments was driven by both our Comdata and Cambridge businesses, which both grew over 20% in the quarter. 
 Our toll business was up 22% organically due primarily to a number of growth initiatives implemented throughout 2017 at STP. 
 Our lodging business was up 38%, driven primarily by an increase in room nights and continued FEMA rooms due to the impact from hurricanes. The FEMA impact contributed about 14% of the growth. So all in all, another very good quarter for our nonfuel businesses. 
 Now moving down the income statement. Total operating expenses for the first quarter were $325.4 million compared to the same $325.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. Included in the first quarter of 2018 was the impact of ASC 606, which netted approximately $24 million of merchant commission and certain processing expenses against revenue. 
 Excluding the impact of ASC 606, operating expenses would have been up approximately 8.3%. The increase was primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2017. 
 As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses were approximately 55.6% compared to 62.5% in the first quarter of 2017. Excluding ASC 606, operating expense as a percentage of total revenue would have been 57.8% in the first quarter of 2018. The decrease in operating expense as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation of approximately $10 million. 
 Credit losses were $12 million for the first quarter or 5 basis points compared to $13 million or 8 basis points in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in bad debt was primarily due to new credit controls implemented in our toll business in Brazil. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 10.2% to $71.5 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $64.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2017. 
 Interest expense increased 34.3% to $31.1 million compared to $23.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in interest expense was due primarily to the impact of additional borrowing for the Cambridge acquisition, share buybacks and increases in LIBOR. There was no equity investment gain or loss in the first quarter of 2018 compared with the $2.4 million loss in the first quarter of 2017. 
 At the end of the third quarter of 2017, we changed our investment agreement in Masternaut, resulting in an accounting change from the equity-to-cost method as we executed on our plan to exit the telematics space. As a result, we no longer record gains or losses on this minority investment in our P&L. 
 Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was 23.7% compared to 26.1% for the first quarter of 2017. The reduction in the tax rate was primarily due to the impact of U.S. tax reform, which went into effect on January 1, 2018. As a result of U.S. tax reform, the federal statutory income tax rate was reduced from 35% to 21%. The reduction in our effective tax rate due primarily to the federal statutory rate being reduced was partially offset by higher U.S. federal taxes related to the new GILTI tax and higher state income taxes, both resulting from U.S. tax reform. Our tax rate was also impacted by lower excess tax benefits on share-based compensation in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the first quarter of 2017. 
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1,223,000,000 in total cash. Approximately $243 million is restricted and consists primarily of customer deposits. As of March 31, 2018, we had $3,620,000,000 outstanding on our term loans and revolver and approximately $630 million of undrawn availability. We also had $829 million borrowed in our securitization facility at the end of the quarter. 
 We purchased approximately 443,000 shares of common stock in the first quarter and have approximately $420 million in repurchase capacity remaining under our current authorization. 
 As of March 31, 2017, our leverage ratio was 2.31x EBITDA, which is well below our covenant level of 4x EBITDA as calculated under our credit agreement. We intend to use our future excess cash flow to temporarily pay down the balance on our revolving credit facility and securitization facility and maintain liquidity for acquisitions and other corporate purposes. 
 Finally, we are not a capital-intensive business, spending approximately $15 million on CapEx during the first quarter of 2018. 
 Now on to our outlook for 2018. First, I want to update you on our latest thinking about the macroeconomic environment for the balance of the year. The good news is that in total, the macro came in mostly where we thought it would be in the first quarter. The current trend is for fuel prices to be slightly ahead and market spreads to be at our prior guidance level for the balance of the year. We also expect foreign exchange rates to continue to trend unfavorably compared to our prior guidance and interest rates to be a little worse. 
 So in total, we are expecting the macro over the balance of the year to be mostly in line with assumptions used in our prior guidance. As a result, we have increased our full year guidance by our first quarter beat versus our prior guidance. Please refer to our first quarter earnings call supplement for additional information. 
 So with that out of the way, our full year guidance is as follows: Total revenues, including the adoption of ASC 606, to be between $2,390,000,000 and $2,450,000,000; net income to be between $705 million and $735 million; net income per diluted share to be between $7.55 and $7.85; revenues, excluding the impact of ASC 606, to be between $2,500,000,000 and $2,560,000,000; adjusted net income to be between $950 million and $980 million; and adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $10.20 and $10.50. 
 Some of the assumptions we have made in preparing the guidance include the following: weighted fuel prices equal to $2.69 per gallon average in the U.S. for those businesses sensitive to the movement in the retail price of fuel for the balance of the year; market spread equal to the 2017 average; foreign exchange rate equal to the 7-day average as of April 2, 2018; interest expense of $125 million; fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately 93.6 million shares; a tax rate of between 22% to 24%; no impact related to acquisitions or material new partnership agreement not already disclosed; and no impact related to the unauthorized access to a portion of the company's system. 
 For the second quarter of 2018, the company is expecting adjusted net income per diluted share to be approximately the same as the first quarter. The second quarter assumes improving revenue and operating performance versus the first quarter, offset by sales and IT initiatives to be funded from savings on the new Tax Act. Additionally, our volumes should build throughout the year and our new asset initiatives should gain momentum throughout the year, resulting in higher revenue and earnings per share, primarily in the third and fourth quarters. 
 And finally, as we reported in today's press release, on April 26, 2018, company personnel identified suspicious activity, primarily on systems involving the company's Stored Value Solutions business. The company took immediate action to stop the activity and limit the improper use of accessed information. The company through counsel promptly engaged external experts in information technology forensics to assist in the investigation. The company also contacted federal law enforcement and merchants known to be affected. The investigation is in its early stages but indicates that a significant number of primarily 6 months or older card and PIN numbers were accessed. The affected data does not include personally identifiable information such as consumer names, social security numbers, driver's license numbers and other sensitive personal data. 
 Following discovery, the company froze certain card information as it's working with merchant customers to limit the impact of the unauthorized access. The company did not see any evidence of access to its systems involving fleet cards and other payment products or to the proprietary and third-party payment networks used to deliver the company's payment solutions. 
 The company continues to investigate its other systems to determine whether any other information or systems have been accessed and whether other customers have been impacted. This investigation is ongoing and will continue until the full nature and scope of the systems and information access has been determined. The company will provide an update on the incident in its upcoming 10-Q, which it expects to file by May 10, 2018. 
 With that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. 
David Togut: Could you walk us through sort of the timing and recovery of fuel card organic revenue growth, kind of parsing out the impacts of GPN (sic) [ GFN ] and the Chevron portfolio over the next few quarters? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Sure, David. It's Ron. Let me try this. So I think we said before and repeat today that we're outlooking in the 8% to 10% range for fuel cards for full year 2018, excluding GFN and Chevron. So in Q1, those numbers were 7 and 1, respectively. And for the full year, I'm just going to use the midpoint to keep it simple, it's probably something like 9 and 6. So kind of -- let me just use the midpoint of 9. So kind of full year, if you asked today what do we think, including the 7 from Q1, so it'll accelerate some, we'd say we expect to finish of the year kind of at 9% organic in fuel cards without GFN and Chevron. And obviously, that split varies by quarter. There's obviously a ton of GFN impact in Q1 because that was whole for us, if you will, last year. And then obviously, there'd be a much bigger impact in Chevron in Q4 as we basically have that exiting out of our forecast. 
David Togut: Got it. And then just as a quick follow-up. The acceleration in Corporate Payments growth to 25% from 16% in 4Q, could you walk us through the sustainability of that higher growth rate? In other words, is the disruption-related payments growth with you for the balance of the year? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Again, I think in my comments, we said think about that thing penciling out in the high teens. So I'd say that we took some actions in our payroll card business, which sits in corporate pay that added some incremental pricing and incremental growth, both in Q4 and Q1. But as I mentioned, obviously, in the direct business, in the construction business, it's fundamentally all volume growth. It's finally been implemented. So I think our numbers have that thing, again, high teens Q2 through 4 this year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Jefferies. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Can you also sort of run through the same thing in the Brazil business, just in terms of talking about what growth will look like there once some of the pricing actions you took sort of cycle through? And also, just what is the addressable market for some of these revenue synergies that you're finding there? Is there a lot of room to scale the types of fuel tag -- paying for the fuel with the RFID tag, and I think you mentioned private garages before. Is there are a lot of runway there in terms of scaling that business? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Ramsey, it's Ron. So I guess, a 2-part answer to that. So yes, 22% was the Q1. I think, again, we said think about that same kind of high teens. We think it will decelerate some as we get later into the year and it lapse the pricing that we put in place kind of in the fall last year. But on the second-part question, I think we said repeatedly the big idea there is to reposition STP from being a toll-dominant kind of toll company to being an RFID payment company. So today, it's, call it, 80%-ish toll revenue and then some parking and then some fuel. So the goal would be to obviously have parking. We've got a plan to double this year the number of parking installations from 500 to 1,000. We've also announced today a plan to dramatically increase the fueling -- the fuel-first footprint through the new Petrobras-BR agreement, who's the largest retailer in Brazil. And we're interestingly in conversations with a couple of the fast food people in Brazil in pilot to put the same technology in the drive-throughs. So the goal as you think kind of into next year and forward is to get a lot of incremental growth from that company in those parking, fuel and fast food segments. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. That's very helpful. A follow-up for me is on M&A. And I wanted to ask about your appetite here or the market conditions and whether that's sort of dictating a steady stream of kind of smaller deals? Or are you still potentially contemplating anything more transformative? And maybe I can just bolt on to that, how much more do you intend to kind of delever here? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, we -- I'd say that certainly on the larger ones, it's opportunistic. We've got a set of large targets that we're in contact with to see whether they're sellers or obviously whether we're buyers. And I'd say the activity we're reporting today is we've got a couple of smaller kind of tuck-in things that are late innings to report today. But look, I mean, our leverage ratio is -- what was there? 
Eric R. Dey: 2.38x. 
Ronald F. Clarke: 2.4x. And obviously, our liquidity for the refinancing last summer is up. So I'd say that balance sheet-wise, Ramsey, we feel obviously in a good place and also management-wise. We reported earlier that the 4 newest deals grew profits 39% in Q1. So it's obviously working what we've recently done. So I'd say look for both. Not in the immediate to say on the big front, but we're positioned in a place that if the opportunity comes, we'll take it. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: I think you -- Ron mentioned, you will close potentially a couple of partner deals. I'm curious, how much impact that might have to your fuel or your fleet organic growth if you were to book those. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. They're not -- I'd call them kind of smallish, both of the things we're working on. So not -- I wouldn't say a material -- maybe a point or 2 kind of range if we were to close them. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Okay. That's good to know. And then on your 18% bookings or new sales, how much of that was fuel versus nonfuel? 
Ronald F. Clarke: I don't have it. Do you have that, Eric, in front of you? 
Eric R. Dey: Hold on one second. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Just trying to get an idea because you've had a lot of activity on the nonfuel side. Just curious how the fuel activity is going on. 
Eric R. Dey: Hold on. We're pulling it out here. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. We -- the reports sitting in front of us is not sorted by product, but I could just eyeball fuel just to give you an idea. The U.K. was up 47%; Russia was 191%; Western Europe, 166%; Australia, 155%; Brazil, 149%. So a bunch of our international, fuel was great. Our U.S. is still kind of mostly flat. Our trucking business was 123, up 23%. And so the softness is still from the GFN thing last year. It's taking time to kind of get our U.S. sales to recover fundamentally. So I'd say -- I don't know what the average of all those, but the U.S. direct business and partner business, not a lot of growth. All the international ones and the trucking one really super first quarter. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Oscar Turner with SunTrust. 
Oscar Turner: First question is just another on fuel. Seems like that segment has accelerated the past few quarters, even if you exclude the MasterCard portfolio conversion impact and Chevron. And it seems like trucking demand is growing. So what do you think is driving that trend? Is there anything outside of those 2 drivers that's affecting kind of your comps in macro growth? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Oscar. It's Ron. So let me just say a couple things. So one, again, our reported number for the quarter for fuel was 7% if you carve out those 2 headwinds, and our forecast is 9% again for full year '18. I'll remind you that I think for the last however many years we reported these 3 years, it's been about 9%. So maybe decelerated in Q1, but for the year, we're kind of thinking 9%, 9%, 9%. That would be the first point. The second one would be the reason, hey, why are we sitting here then at 7%, Ron? Why are we waiting for the thing to accelerate? Why is it 9% in the first quarter? I'd say when we built the forecast, the 2 things that have it running below the 9% or 1% is sales recovery again from that GFN thing. We've re-podded people into service roles. We moved people around into other products that were working. So there's been a longer tail fundamentally in recovering the sales in those segments. We kind of reallocated resources to other areas. And then second, I'd say the GFN attrition rate has stayed a bit elevated. We expected that curve to come down more steeply towards normalized levels. And so I'd say that those would be the couple of things kind of holding the thing back a bit. 
Oscar Turner: Okay. It's helpful. And then a follow-up just on some of the growth initiatives you talked about recently beyond fuel in the U.S. and fuel-first in Brazil, how do we think about the time to ramp, and when do we -- or when do you expect to see material revenue contribution from those initiatives? 
Ronald F. Clarke: That's also the million-dollar question for us, too. I'd say we don't know. It's hard to forecast the magnitude. What I would say and try to tease out a bit on my comments is it's working, kind of what we're doing is working. So the example of the trucking card, which is probably 90 or 120 days in clients' hands and the fact that the behavior of the cardholders has changed that dramatically, and that it's turned into fundamentally a doubling of monthly card revenue would be something I'd say to you, wow. As I roll that forward, what's the pace that we can get those clients adopted, and will the behaviors of the future cardholders look the same? So I'd say that we'll probably have a much better handle on answering that thing as we get later into the year and start to build plans for the following year. But I'd say the reception, both in our construction segment here, the thing we've called out before, BuilderPro, is still growing like a weed, and now, this trucking one. So what we can report is that we're getting evidence that this beyond fuel idea can work. And hopefully, we can size it better for you as we work through the year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from James Schneider with Goldman Sachs. 
James Schneider: I was wondering if you could maybe touch a little bit on the same-store sales trends you saw in the quarter, which verticals were a little bit better, or which ones were a little bit weaker. And any kind of directionality you can provide in terms of where those same-store sales trend might go in the next quarter or so would be helpful. 
Ronald F. Clarke: James, it's Ron. I, again, kind of mentioned in the opening that the 4 kind of positive pockets were lodging, so that was quite healthy. I think we had mentioned that the whale had recovered from a year-plus ago and the small account business there is quite healthy. So that was quite positive. Corporate pay is getting healthier because the health care portion is shrinking. No pun intended there. And so the balance of the thing is healthier, and so it's got a higher number. And then the 2 markets, Brazil and Russia, that were quite soft a year or 2 ago, those economies have gotten dramatically better. And particularly in the case of Russia, we've introduced a product a year ago that works almost everywhere, so we're grabbing just way more share of wallet -- of customer. So it's growing. So those would be the 4 that I think caused the rise of from, call it, 1% or 2% to 3%. And I'd say going forward, who knows? It's a macro call. I'd say if you made us guess, we would hope the thing would stay in the kind of plus 1% to 2% range. 
James Schneider: Very helpful. And then maybe you could talk a little bit about corporate pay and some of the sales initiatives that you're undertaking there and talk about how Comdata is tethering with Cambridge, and what specific activity with Cambridge you're kind of undertaking. I know you've kind of talked about moving them more upmarket to larger merchants. But maybe talk about the complexity of what's going on in terms of the sales initiatives there, please. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. So in the core Comdata Corporate Payments business, I'd say the primary work there is scale. So we've got a model that works. We're selling a ton. I think we reported we grew sales, I think, close to 50%, Eric, in the prior year. So the key, James, in that business for us has really just been scale. More of the same, more coverage, more territory people. And our plan is, again, to grow that thing, grow sales again another, I think, 15% to 20% this year. In terms of the cross-sell, it's still early. We signed some number of deals. I think we targeted 300-ish accounts from Cambridge, and I think I've had appointments with about 1/4 of them, call it, I don't know, 70, 75. And we've got some number of deals and probably half or more of those in the pipeline. So I think it's still early, but the reaction is positive. We're obviously getting the Cambridge clients to agree to meet and hear the pitch. And then on the Cambridge side, we're taking a step to create what we call an enterprise group. We've analyzed what percent of their whole business is of some kind of significant size, call it an enterprise-size account. And we've got, I don't know, a 12% or 15% position of that whole business. And so we're going to pour more senior people, particularly here in the U.S., into this enterprise segment and move away again from that smaller, old-fashioned dealer kind of model that the company had. So I'd say you'd continue to see not only growing sales. Their sales were up significantly, Eric, in Q1. Up 37%, James, in Q1 that you'd continue seeing us onboarding larger accounts. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: I just had a question on the unauthorized access. When we think about what a potential liability would be given the cards that were compromised were 6 months or greater. Is there any way to determine like the scope of what we're talking about? Is it the minority or majority? And then, I guess, I was wondering maybe just get more specifics on where and why this happened. 
Eric R. Dey: Sanjay, this is Eric. Let me give you a little more color around what's going on. We found out about this issue about a week ago. We obviously have very defined practices in place to detect these kind of things, and we did discover that there was some unauthorized access. And again, it was about a week ago. And again, our investigation to date indicates that the theft appears to be limited to SVS and a few of its clients. And we also -- investigation indicates that card data that was obtained consist primarily of private label gift card numbers and PINs, so no bankcards were involved and no personal identifiable information was released at all. We've also found that there's been no evidence of any intrusion into any of FleetCor's processing or financial systems. And our investigation is ongoing. And hopefully, over the next week or so, we'll learn a lot more as, again, we've employed some IT forensic people to kind of pore through our systems to identify where the weakness was. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Sanjay, it's Ron. Let me just add on that what would say it's super early days. We wanted to disclose that I got the call on Sunday that we became aware of the thing. So the first headline is it's really early. But the magnitude question, I'd say the good news is 5 days in studying, it was half the technical people on the planet there, it's only a few clients that we've seen that there's any data that's actually been compromised, taken, if you will. And on your question to why and how, the short answer appears to be customer portals. As we open up all our systems on the planet, there's more opportunity to get into UIs. And so that's why the monitoring is able to detect it. If clients start to do things with the servers that don't look normal, our people get on it. So that's how it was able to get shut down. So early days, more to say as we get smarter. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Okay. And my follow-up is just so I'm clear on what would happen. I mean, it would be unauthorized -- or it would be fraudulent transactions that would occur with those few partners, and that would be the extent of where the damages would be? I'm just trying to understand sort of how that would manifest itself into a liability for you. And then one other question on beyond-fuel. Ron, you mentioned that there's some of your customers that are on pilot. How did you guys determine who goes on pilot? And when we think about how broad that could be applied against your customer base, how significant? Is it the majority of your customers that might be able to use that product? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Let me try to just finish on the cyber thing, so the liability. So yes, is the short answer, if some cyber-criminal takes digital card information, the liability would be that obviously, that would be used fraudulently to make redemptions. And so the good news, if there is such a thing and someone's stealing something, is it's an old-fashioned kind of business and large percentages, kind of circa 80% of gift card redemptions, at least the SVS ones, are made with plastic at physical stores. And so because the compromised didn't involve mag stripe, there's no way to counterfeit the cards. So effectively, most of the client info that was compromised, it can be business as usual. Legitimate people like us with the cards going to the stores goes on as normal. And we've obviously shut down the digital card prints for the balance that would try redeem electronically. So it's -- again, it's early days, but it appears that the thing is limited in scope. And we're going to try to provide an update with our Q, what, in a week? 
Eric R. Dey: Week from today. 
Ronald F. Clarke: So we'll obviously know more in a week, so we'll provide a bit more. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Bob Napoli with William Blair. 
Robert Napoli: Just following up on that a little bit. The gift card business, I mean, I know it's only a week in, but in your guidance, are you doing anything different in that business? Are you -- or do you expect business as usual, like 7% of your revenue, and it's obviously a business you've been considering divesting for a while. 
Eric R. Dey: Yes. Bob, this is Eric. It's pretty much business as usual from a guidance perspective. We don't anticipate any material impact to the business itself at this point. 
Robert Napoli: Okay. And I think the beyond fuel, I think Sanjay had asked what percentage of your customer base could possibly use that product? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Bob. It's Ron. So the answer is it depends on the application. So let me give a couple of examples. So in the case of construction, which is about 1/4 of our U.S. and U.K. fuel card client base, this concept of adding a construction supplies card would be applicable to the entire 25%, assuming they were sufficiently creditworthy. And then on the balance, we've looked at all kinds of concepts, from things like an admin or owner cards, because most of our clients are small. They could buy or pay other kinds of general AP, to opening the cards up a bit more for things like traditional T&E. So we're working through 2 or 3 different kinds of applications of beyond fuel and seeing which ones resonate. But the 2 that we know for sure work are the construction supplies thing for the construction segment and this -- using personal money in the trucking business like we would use a debit card instead of converting into cash. So for sure, those 2 applications are working. When we talked the last time that we don't have a ton of revenue reports. I want to reiterate. We think it's still a very big idea, not only in terms of added revenue, but that the stickiness of adding this kind of capability on the client base is a pretty important thing long term. 
Robert Napoli: On the M&A front, are you -- which segments of your business are there more opportunities to add and grow the Corporate Payments there? Should we expect to see more activity in Corporate Payments? I mean, lodging is kind of a niche business, I think, but your Corporate Payments and maybe tolls? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. We have -- I've got the page in front of me. We've obviously got targets in every one of the 4 primary spend categories. And then obviously, we have some targets that are in a couple of categories that we're not in but that we've studied. And so I think people would be fools to not think that we will make ongoing acquisitions in each of the categories that we're in. We will. 
Robert Napoli: Are there large like game-changing opportunities that we would... 
Ronald F. Clarke: As I said, it's a mix. The couple things in front of me that are closest are kind of tuck-in, are smallish. But obviously, for the earlier call, there are some larger targets. I'd say none of those are super close in, but who knows? We're in a place finally leveraging liquidity-wise that if we like it, we'll pull the trigger. 
Operator: And the next question comes from Pete Christiansen with Citi. 
Peter Christiansen: I guess, industry volatility has kind of perked up quite a bit here, I guess, as recent market developments. Does that change your thoughts on potentially hedging your current debt and your floating exposure? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes, Pete. This is Eric. We're looking at that. I think, ideally, we would hedge in conjunction with a large acquisition. It would make it easier for us to effectively do that. But we are looking at it. 
Peter Christiansen: Okay. And then I'm interested in the P97 business there. Can you just run us through what's the monetization model there or the business model? 
Ronald F. Clarke: For them or for us? 
Peter Christiansen: No, for them. I'm sorry. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. For them, the model is basically to get paid by the merchants. So in this case, the oil brands, the gas station brands, and to get paid per transaction. So in our role as a user, client for P97, take one of our proprietary fuel card products, for example, we would go out to our merchants and say, "Hey, we can enable you guys to take mobile." We might fund some of that. They might fund some of the merchant. And then we would pay in that example as the issuer something per tran to enable the mobile transaction. So those are the 2 ways P97 gets money. They get it from the merchant kind of enabling, and then they get it as transactions click through the app. 
Peter Christiansen: And this would enable like a FleetCor app to be a payment mechanism, almost like a wallet for your specific product? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean, the simple layman's way, at least, Pete, for me to think about it is the P97 has come up with a way sitting in the cloud or sitting in a host to basically talk through the systems that sit in the gas stations. They don't have to physically go there and do retrofitting. They literally go talk to the point-of-sale or the cash register systems. And so -- and then they connect it with an app. So the driver comes in, the app obviously connects to the host, and the host tells the gas station, station number 12 to turn on pump 8. And so fundamentally, it's like a loop between the app on the phone, the P97 host and then talking to the gas station's existing equipment to turn the pumps on. So it's pretty cool. It can be used as a private label app. Someone like -- take BP. BP could contract directly with them and create a BP app for anyone that's got a BP card when they come into BP. We could do it with the merchant networks that we have and make it a Fuelman app or a Comdata app or a credit card company. Citibank, if you have their card, could make it a Citibank app if enough stations were signed up. So it's -- we bought into it because it's the -- we thought the easiest way to enable mobile because you've seen what's happened with EMV and the pain of all these legacy gadgets that sit in these 160,000 places. We thought the time line would be really long making those mobile enabled. And so we like the approach here a lot. And so we got a bit of an exclusive deal with them in the fuel card space, and we're going to kind of chase after this. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. 
Ashish Sabadra: I just wanted to hone in further on the GFN. So you mentioned that the bookings were flat, but you've done some sales reorganization effort. I was just wondering, how do you think about the bookings -- how do you think about the sales effort there now? Do you think those sales team has set expectations for bookings for like MasterCard platform going forward? Just wondering if you could provide any color. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Ashish. It's Ron. So a couple of things. So one, again, the product is working well. It's green; two, about 30% of our fuel card sales in the quarter went on that GFN platform; three, we still are making some MasterCard sales on our old mainframe platform because we had to move people off of it last year. So there's a bit of a mix. I'd say that performance is improving. If we look at the last 6 months, we started to restaff the thing. Sales are increasing. We're getting more distance from the problem that we had. And so the expectation is as we roll through the next set of quarters that we'll get that thing stepped back up again. We're kind of at historical levels, but obviously, we're trying to sell 15% to 20% more, right, to fuel the growth. So when you sell the same amount as the prior year, you don't generate much growth. So it's a high priority to get that thing staffed and productive over the next few quarters. 
Ashish Sabadra: And then maybe on the lodging side, you talked about the digital product there, the mobile booking product, and it looks like that's driving some pretty good uplift. Has that been rolled out to all the customers? Or is it -- can that drive incremental customers as well in addition to having a lift in bookings in your existing customer base? Any color that you can provide on that front? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. That's another great question. So first of all, I mean, for us -- most of us, the idea of hitting a button on a phone to order something is pretty common, but again, a year ago, we had 0. Every CLC traveler called the hotel himself or showed up because they're kind of boots people, driving around. And so this idea of when we launched it last year, "Hey, let's give him a digital and normal way to book." The fact that 1/3 of all the room nights that were observed were on the app and that those customers, those same accounts that used it grew 10% for us was great. That's the first point. Second point is we've rolled that out to all of the small accounts, and the adoption is growing month over month. So I don't know what it will be, but if you roll through Q2 and Q3, we could approach 40%, 50% maybe of all the rooms, as we run through this year being booked digitally. And then obviously, maybe you're still getting that 10% corresponding lift. And then third, I'd say, yes, our new sales were up again pretty significantly in Q1 in the report. And the sales review is it's an easier thing to explain to people now. So when they call up new companies and pitch the thing, "Hey, we have this network. It's a control network. Your guys can call themselves or you can just book on your phone," I think it's a more understandable product to present to the marketplace. So yes, it should help us on the new accounts side as well. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Vasu Govil with Morgan Stanley. 
Vasundhara Govil: Just quickly on the tolls business. As you guys looked to reposition that part of the business from a toll company to an RFID payments company, is there also a plan to move the revenue model to more of a transaction-driven revenue model? Or is the thought that as people use it for more and more uses, the attrition will kind of go down? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, it's Ron again. That's a great question. This is, in some ways, a little bit strange that because in Brazil, the toll concessionaires, the toll operators owned STP, they set the thing up as a 0 MDR product, a free payment system. So users could go to the merchants, the tolls, and the merchants could get 100% of the face value, and the payment company wouldn't get anything. That's a pretty unusual model because of who owned it. So FYI, we may be working to try to change that over time. But the good news is that the other categories in the repositioning, fuel, parking, which we're already in, we do get MDR like on a normal car. So we obviously get MDR at the fueling stations, at the parking. And obviously, in this fast-food pilot, I mentioned the same thing. And so you're right on. As we grow volume in those 3 non-toll areas, way more the revenue will come from the merchant versus from the customer. 
Vasundhara Govil: Understood. That's very helpful. And I think previously you had mentioned about 3 to 4 new toll roads coming on in Brazil this year. Have those already kicked in, or do we know what the timing would be for those? 
Ronald F. Clarke: They haven't. They -- I think there were 2 that were supposed to come online in Q2, and they're supposedly still. They've all been approved, but they've, I think, gotten stalled a bit with the election. I don't know if they're redoing -- or whatever you call it. They've got another election. 
Eric R. Dey: Presidential election. 
Ronald F. Clarke: I think it's in the fall. 
Eric R. Dey: In October. 
Ronald F. Clarke: And so I think that has slowed. If you think about it, it's a bit of a tax, right, effectively. They're taking roads that were free, privatizing them and using toll proceeds to pay the developers, if you will, of those roads. And so I don't think it's politically super popular. So I don't know this, but my guess is they're just kind of slow-walking it a bit as they head into the election. So it may be a little bit later, but again, the things have all been signed off. The people have already built the roads. They're just waiting effectively to turn them on and start collecting tolls. 
Vasundhara Govil: And if I can just squeeze one last quick one. Any change in the timing of the Chevron de-conversion? Or is that still stated for the beginning of the third quarter? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes. It looks like it's been delayed a little bit. But we are anticipating it to transition off by the, I guess, by the fourth quarter. But we'll wait and see. It's just going a little bit slower than we originally projected. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt O'Neill with Autonomous Research. 
Matthew O'Neill: I was just hoping to follow-up quickly on the M&A discussion. I think last quarter, you talked about a handful of deals in the roughly $100 million to $500 million range. Is that in line with the "smaller deals" you were referring to at various points today? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. 
Matthew O'Neill: Great. And then just as a quick follow-up, I noticed the spread revenues were down materially, which I think is -- typically corresponds when we see a pretty significant increase in fuel prices. Is that a phenomenon that should presumably abate kind of going forward through the rest of this year? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, you got it exactly right. Those things are a counterbalance. And so assuming that the current fuel price levels stabilize, the wholesale will catch the retail and call it a week -- a week to 10 days. 
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer session as well as the conference call. You may disconnect your lines. Thank you for participating, and have a pleasant day.

===== 2017 Q4  (2018-02-08 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the FLEETCOR Technologies Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] 
 I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, James Eglseder, Head of Investor Relations. 
James Eglseder: Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. By now you should have access to our fourth quarter press release, which can be found on our website www.fleetcor.com under the Investor Relations section.
 I would like to point out that we also published a supplemental presentation in conjunction with the release that we hope will be useful in reviewing our results and outlook.
 Throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than other companies similarly titled non-GAAP information. Quantitative reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today's press release and on our website as previously described. Also, we are providing 2018 guidance on both a GAAP and the non-GAAP basis with a reconciliation of the two.
 Finally, before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements. This includes forward-looking statements about our 2018 guidance, new products and fee initiatives and expectations regarding business development and acquisitions. They are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore, you should not put undue reliance upon them. These results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K and on our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available on our website, as previously discussed and at www.sec.gov.
 With that out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay. Jim, thanks. We're delighted that you've joined us, the head of IR here at FLEETCOR. And hi to everyone, I appreciate you joining the call this afternoon. So upfront here, I'll plan to cover 3 subjects. First, I'll provide my take on Q4 and full year 2017. Second, I'll discuss our plans and our guidance for 2018. And then finally, I'll share our thoughts on our midterm prospects, those beyond 2018.
 Okay. So on to the quarter. We reported Q4 revenue of $610 million, up 18%, and cash EPS of $242 million, up 28%. So $610 million and $242 million, 18% top line, 28% bottom line.
 Some good news on organic revenue growth for the quarter. Overall organic growth improved to 10% in Q4. Inside of that, our fuel card organic growth was 5%, although we believe it would have been 8% to 9% if adjusted for the MasterCard conversion. 
 Our nonfuel card, our product categories, tolls, lodging and corporate payments, excluding Cambridge, all grew organically in excess of 20% for the quarter. So very strong.
 In terms of other trends, our same-store sales were positive plus 2% for the quarter, that's on top of 2% last quarter as well. We saw increased strength in Brazil and Russia inside our hotel business, the rail and oil and gas recovered nicely and a lot of strength across the board in our Corporate Payments business. 
 Another train customer retention, very strong 91% in Q4, that makes 11 consecutive quarters at 90% plus.
 Our sales, our new sales bookings, terrific, up 23% in Q4 and that's on back of 23% sales growth that we reported in Q3. So new sales bookings accelerating here in the second half versus the first half. 
 So look, in summary, we'd say a very good Q4. Cash EPS, up 28%, revenues came in at the high end of our expectations. Organic growth improved to 10% overall. Continued record sales growth, up 23%. Strengthening of our same-store sales, up plus 2% and continued 90% plus customer retention.
 So in terms of full year 2017, let me talk about just a few highlights. So first, revenue of $2,250,000,000, up 23%, full year cash EPS of $854 million also up 23%. So 23% top, 23% bottom for full year 2017. Our full year 2017 new sales bookings, up 18% for the full year, but again, 23% in the second half. Our full year 2017 organic revenue growth penciled out at 9%. We did reposition the portfolio in '17 for faster growth. We acquired Cambridge along with 2 tuck-in acquisitions and sold NexTraq, our telematics business to Michelin. 
 STP worked out quite well, we integrated it nicely here in its first full year at FLEETCOR. Revenues for the full year grew 18% and their profits grew over 50% versus 2016 pro forma.
 In terms of presenting our company, we think we simplified the presentation of FLEETCOR into 4 primary spend categories, enhanced our disclosures, hoping to make the company easier to understand, and we did return some capital. We retired almost 2.9 million FLEETCOR shares in '17 and refinanced our credit facility to give us a bit more liquidity.
 So look, all in all, a pretty good year. Greater than 20% revenue and profit growth, record sales, good retention, a material acquisition, some accretive capital allocation and a pretty strong finish.
 Okay, let me transition over to our plans for 2018. First, I'll lay out our '18 guidance and then speak a bit to the bridge. So for full year 2018, our guidance is as follows. Revenue of $2,520,000,000 at the midpoint, that's up 12% or $270 million and cash EPS of $10.20 at the midpoint, that's up approximately 20%. So if you think about the revenue bridge, it goes something like this. The net impact of the new acquisitions versus the divestitures in '17 gives us about a 3% lift in '18. We're expecting the macro fuel and FX to help us about 2% in '18, and we're planning normalized organic growth to be between 8% and 10%. 
 Inside of that though, we do expect the one-time grow overs related to Chevron, FEMA and GFN to press normalize growth about 2%. So if you add those 4 up, that should be the 12% planned revenue increase.
 We have included a bridge in our earnings supplement for this call to help walk through this.
 Inside of the overall 12% revenue growth, we're expecting our fuel card business to grow 6% to 8%, our gift and all other buckets to be fundamentally flat and then the rest of our nonfuel card businesses to grow quite nicely into mid-teens.
 If you recall, we have grown revenues organically about 9% in 2016 and 2017. So we're planning the same range 8% to 10% this year, 2018 on a normalized basis. Our sales and retention trends, as I mentioned earlier, are quite good, which gives us some confidence in the 8% to 10% target.
 So in terms of cash EPS, the bridge goes something like this. We've reported $854 million in cash EPS for 2017, and in a constant tax world, we're expecting cash EPS to grow about 15% at the midpoint. But as a result of the tax reform, we're estimating today about a 5% lower 2018 ETR, around 23% versus close to 28% in 2017. That lower tax rate results in about $0.64 of tax savings. Our plan this year is to invest about a third of that of those tax savings back into the business and that takes us to our $10.20 cash EPS guidance at the midpoint.
 In terms of the initial thoughts for the tax savings reinvestment, we're considering 3 areas. So first, employees, returning some of our tax savings to our employees who obviously make FLEETCOR go. We're looking at improving certain benefits in the company like 401(k) and considering higher minimum wages.
 The second area for reinvestment is in growth, specifically to hire some additional sales teams where things are working and then some additional IT resources to accelerate growth at the midterm.
 And then the third area is really transformation. We've got a couple of big transformational initiatives to simplify and standardize our systems and really improve quality and the overall customer experience. So thoughts are to double down there.
 In terms of our plan, yes, we do think there could be some upside potentially to the $10.20 plan. We do have some active partner prospects and some active acquisitions that obviously will progress this year.
 Okay, so last up is the midterm. So let me relay our thinking as it relates to the midterm prospects, so beyond 2018. So at the highest level, we think of our company as participating in 4 major spend categories. Fuel, toll, lodging and corporate pay. Each of these categories are multi-billion dollar market opportunities and we're fortunate to have advantaged positions in each one of them. We did enjoy 20%-plus revenue growth in the 3 nonfuel lines of business in Q4 excluding Cambridge, and we do expect fuel to recover to the 8% to 10% mark once we lap the onetime items this year.
 I do want to speak a bit about some of the innovative product and distribution ideas that we're working that could have some lift, some impact to our midterm prospects. So in the fuel card category, we have spoken about this fuel-first initiative in Brazil. We're quite excited about that. Expanding the market there to non-toll users, so that's in progress. We also like this beyond fuel idea here in the U.S. and the U.K. of getting our existing fuel card clients to spend monies on other purchase categories other than fuel.
 In lodging, we're underway with our couple new ways for our clients to book. Historically, our CLC clients either walked into hotels or called and reserve rooms themselves. We've now offered a digital option, which people obviously have come to expect along with an old-fashioned kind of reservation option, which provides what we call, more ways to book. And we're already seeing some volume lift early on.
 In the toll business, in STP, we've launched 3 or 4 new sales channel approaches including using third-party retailers, pushing hard at the digital, the web and even testing vending machines to sell tags in 2017. The success has been pretty good and we're actually planning 30% of all new STP sales in 2018 to come from these new channels.
 We also are looking at 3 or 4 new toll roads in Brazil that come online starting this spring. So we should get a bit of a lift from that.
 And lastly, in Corporate Payments, we've spoken about this full AP solution that we're working on, in which we'd offer smaller clients, a combination of virtual card, ACH and even paper checks, so that they could get a complete payables-outsourcing solution. So quite excited about pushing that forward. And clearly with Cambridge now in the fold, we have some opportunities to bundle and cross-sell international FX, so a couple of upsides there.
 So lastly, we feel quite clear on what we're trying to do to grow the business. As a reminder, 3 things. So one, we're simply trying to add more clients by selling more and offering innovative products. Two, we're trying to capture more spend from clients, offering new spend categories to them. And then lastly we're looking to widen or expand the geography in which we do everything that we do.
 So anyway we do like our midterm prospects and hope that you do too.
 So with that, let me turn the call over to Eric, he'll cover a few more details on the quarter and on '18. Eric? 
Eric R. Dey: Thank you, Ron. For the fourth quarter of 2017, we reported revenue of $610 million, up 18.5% compared to $515 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The revenue from our North America segment increased 18% to $387.8 million from $328.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.
 Revenue from our international segment increased 19.2% to $222.2 million from $186.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the fourth quarter of 2017, GAAP net income increased 196.3% to $282.7 million or $3.05 per diluted share from $95.4 million or $1 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016.
 Included in the fourth quarter of 2017 net income was an estimated favorable impact of adoption of a Tax Reform Act of $127.5 million. Non-GAAP financial metrics that we routinely use are adjusted revenues and adjusted net income, which we sometimes also refer to as cash net income or cash EPS. 
 Adjusted revenues equal our GAAP revenues less merchant commissions. A reconciliation of adjusted revenues and adjusted net income to GAAP numbers are provided in exhibit one of our press release.
 Adjusted revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $579.5 million, up 18.4% compared to $489.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 24.1% to $224.1 million, compared to $180.5 million. And adjusted net income per diluted share increased 27.6% to $2.42 compared to $1.90 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016.
 Fourth quarter results reflect the impact of a positive macroeconomic environment. Changes in foreign exchange rates from the fourth quarter of 2016 were primarily positive, and we believe positively impacted revenue during the quarter by approximately $9 million. Fuel prices were also mostly favorable during the quarter and although we cannot precisely calculate the impact of these changes, we believe positively impacted revenues by approximately $8 million.
 And finally, fuel spreads had no meaningful impact versus the fourth quarter of 2016. So in total, the impact of those changes positively impacted our fourth quarter revenues by approximately $17 million and adjusted net income per diluted share by approximately $0.11 versus the fourth quarter of 2016.
 Organic revenue growth even after adjusting out the positive impact of the macroeconomic environment was approximately 10% for the fourth quarter of 2017.
 Now let's shift over and discuss other drivers of our fourth quarter performance. Most of our major product categories performed well during the quarter. Our fuel card business reported 5% organic growth in the quarter. However, we believe the organic growth would have been approximately 8% or 9% after adjusting for the MasterCard conversion issue in the first quarter. We expect that organic growth in the category will continue to be impacted until we lap the conversion issue at the end of the second quarter up to 2018.
 The Corporate Payments category continues to grow well and was up 16% organically during the quarter as we saw very good growth from our new customer acquisitions over the last few years. Our toll business was up 24% organically due primarily to implementation of a number of our growth initiatives, implemented throughout the year at STP. 
 Our lodging business was up 31%, driven primarily by higher sales and increase in room nights due to improvement in the energy sector and continued FEMA rooms due to the impact of hurricanes in 2017.
 The gift business was up 6% organically due primarily to the timing of card sales. So all in all, another solid quarter for our businesses.
 Now moving down the income statement. Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $370 million, compared to $299 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. An increase of 23.7%. As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses increased to 60.7% of revenue, compared to 58.1% in the fourth quarter of 2016.
 Included in operating expenses are merchant commissions, processing expenses, bad debt, selling and general and administrative expense, depreciation and amortization expense and other operating net. The increase in operating expenses were primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2017, which has a lower than average EBITDA margins, an increase in stock-based compensation to $24.6 million compared to $14 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, and additional legal and settlement expenses booked in the fourth quarter.
 Credit losses were $8.9 million for the fourth quarter or 5 basis points, compared to $11.4 million or 7 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2016. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 7.2% to $65.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from $61.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2017.
 Interest expense increased 40.2% to $30.8 million, compared to $22 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in interest expense was due primarily to the impact of additional borrowing for the Cambridge acquisition, share buybacks and increases in LIBOR. 
 Equity investment loss decreased to $667,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus a loss of $38.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The year-over-year change was primarily due to a $36 million impairment charge booked in the fourth quarter of 2016, and 2017 changes associated with our investment arrangement with the majority partner.
 On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The tax act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including but not limited to reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and requiring companies to pay a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The transition tax can be paid over 8 years. Also, the SEC staff issued staff accounting bulletin 118, which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the tax act. In accordance with SAB 118, we have a 1-year measurement period in which to complete our accounting for the tax act.
 We have made an estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the onetime transition tax, which resulted in a provisional net tax benefit of $127.5 million, which is included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations.
 The onetime transition tax is based on our total post-1986 earnings and profits that we previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. In the fourth quarter, we recorded a professional amount for the onetime transition tax expense of $882.5 million. We also remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities after considering the U.S. federal income tax rate reduction to 21%. The provisional tax benefit recorded related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liability was $210 million.
 As stated earlier, we are still analyzing certain aspects of the tax act and refining our calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances.
 In the fourth quarter of 2017, after the impact of the tax act, as I just discussed, we recorded a tax benefit of $74.4 million, compared to a tax expense of $58 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.
 Excluding the impact of the tax act, our GAAP taxes would have been $53.1 million or 25.5%, compared to 37.8% in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
 The fourth quarter of 2016 tax rate was unfavorably impacted by the non-cash impairment charge, which resulted in a reduction in basis in a minority investment for book purposes but not for tax purposes. Excluding this non-cash item, our tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2016 would have been 30.2%.
 The fourth quarter of 2017 tax rate was favorably impacted by a tax project completed in the fourth quarter, which lowered our fourth quarter tax rate by approximately 2.8%, it will also benefit future periods by approximately the same amount. 
 In addition, a onetime true-up of prior year taxes reduced our fourth quarter tax rate by approximately 1.3%. Our normalized tax rate for the quarter was approximately 27%.
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1,131,000,000 in total cash. Approximately $190 million is restricted and consists primarily of customer deposits. 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had $2,656,000,000 outstanding on our term A loan. $349 million outstanding on our term B loan and $670 million drawn on our revolver, leaving approximately $615 million of undrawn availability. We had $811 million borrowed in our securitization facility at the end of the quarter. 
 We did not repurchase any shares of common stock in the fourth, and in total for 2017, we purchased 2,850,000 shares. We have approximately $510 million in repurchase capacity remaining under our current authorization.
 As of December 31, 2017, our leverage ratio was 2.42x EBITDA, which is well below our covenant level of 4x EBITDA as calculated under our new credit agreement. We intend to use our future excess cash flow to temporarily pay down the balance on our revolving credit facility and securitization facility, and maintain liquidity for acquisitions and other corporate purposes. 
 Finally, we're not a capital-intensive business, spending approximately $21 million on CapEx during the fourth quarter of 2017.
 Now onto our outlook for 2018. Before I walk you through our 2018 Outlook, there are a number of puts and takes I want to make sure you have considered as you model the walk from 2017 actuals to our 2018 guidance.
 First, the net effect of 2017 acquisitions and divestitures on 2018, such as a full year of Cambridge, CLS, and a new partner deal in Russia and a disposition of NexTraq will result in approximately $70 million of additional pro forma annualized revenue in 2018 versus what was reported in 2017. Partially offsetting these items is the impact of a deconversion of a major oil partner, which we are estimating to not have in the second half of the year. The residual impact in the first half of 2018 of the portfolio conversion issue from early in 2017, and the favorable benefit of the FEMA contract in our lodging business that will not recur in 2018. 
 All in, this amounts to an estimated $40 million reduction to your starting point for 2018 revenues.
 Secondly, I want to update you on our latest thinking about the macroeconomic environment. For 2018, we are again expecting the macro to have a favorable impact on our results. We are estimating that the absolute price of fuel will be higher than the 2017 average and positively impact revenue in 2018. 
 Foreign exchange rates should continue to be favorable and spreads will be approximately neutral to 2017. In total, we believe these items will create an estimated $40 million revenue tailwind and positively impact cash EPS by approximately $0.15 per share. However, we estimate that higher interest rates will negatively impact 2018 EPS by an estimated $0.15 per share effectively offsetting the favorable revenue macro.
 Third, we are planning for another 8% to 10% organic growth rate year after adjusting out the favorable macro and the organic scope changes outlined earlier. Helping to drive the 8% to 10% organic growth rate in 2018, our fuel cards, which are expected to grow organically in the 8% to 10% range after adjusting for the deconversion of an oil partner and MasterCard conversion impact that will continue to the second quarter of 2018 or approximately 6% to 8% on a print basis. We expect the corporate payments, toll and lodging businesses to grow mid-teens in 2018, and gift another to be approximately flat.
 And lastly, while we are still evaluating recently released interpretations of the new tax act, we estimate an effective tax rate for 2018 of approximately 22% to 24%. The estimated benefit from the change is expected to be approximately $0.65 in adjusted net income per share. 
 And as Ron mentioned earlier, we expect to invest roughly 1/3 of this benefit back into the business in 2018.
 Also, please refer to our fourth quarter earnings call supplement for additional information. 
 So with that out of the way, our guidance is as follows: total revenues to be between $2,490,000,000 and $2,550,000,000. Adjusted revenues to be between $2,370,000,000 and $2,430,000,000. GAAP net income to be between $690 million and $720 million, GAAP net income per diluted share to be between $7.40 and $7.70. Adjusted net income to be between $935 million and $965 million. And adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $10.05 and $10.35. 
 This guidance represents approximately a 12% growth in revenue and 20% growth in adjusted net income per diluted share for the year at the midpoint of the range.
 Some of the assumptions we have made in preparing the guidance includes the following: weighted fuel prices equal to $2.57 per gallon average in the U.S. for those businesses sensitive to the movement in the retail price of fuel. Market spreads equal to the 2017 average, foreign exchange rates equal to the 7-day average as of January 22, 2018. Interest expense of $125 million, which assumes 2 additional 25 basis point increases in 2018. 
 Fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately 93.3 million shares, a tax rate of 22% to 24%, no impact for new revenue accounting standard as we are still completing our analysis, and no impact related to acquisitions or material new partnership agreements not already disclosed.
 And for those of you that are looking for guidance in the first quarter, I want to remind everyone that our business has some seasonality and that typically the first quarter is the lowest in terms of both revenue and profit. 
 First quarter seasonality is impacted by weather, holidays in the U.S. and lower business levels in Brazil due to summer break and the Carnival celebration that occurs in the first quarter.
 With that said, we are expecting our first quarter 2018 adjusted net income per share to be between $2.30 and $2.40. Additionally, our volumes should build throughout the year and our new asset initiatives should gain momentum throughout the year, resulting in higher revenue and earnings per share in the second to fourth quarters.
 With that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ramsey El-Assal with Jefferies. 
Ramsey El-Assal: I wanted to ask about the organic guidance growth. You hit 10% this quarter, which was great, and yet next year you have a little bit of deceleration, I understand there are some puts and takes and sort of potential headwinds from the conversion but what would cause your organic growth performance to trend at a lower end of the range versus the upper end of a range or to exceed? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Ramsey, it's Ron. I'd say, the short answer is we're lapping a bit of the pricing late in the year, late in '17. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. And then in your presentation, you'd mentioned that no impact for the ASC 606, and that's something that you're still evaluating. Is there a -- do you have any way to help us think about what the potential impact there could be if it would be material, et cetera? 
Eric R. Dey: Ramsey, this is Eric. Yes, we don't expect any material outcome certainly on our bottom line results in any way, shape or form. The only thing that we're really discussing is whether to use the metric that we call, adjusted revenues today versus just revenue. So there is a possibility that, that would be our revenue going forward, but we'll have an answer to that in obviously in about 30 days. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. And just quick last one from me. Just was wondering, and this is kind of reaching back in the past a little bit. Any incremental regulatory or legal items that are worth calling out or anything -- any developments on that front in the last few months? 
Eric R. Dey: Not really, Ramsey. No, no real new -- there's no development there at all. 
Operator: Our next question is from David Togut with Evercore ISI. 
David Togut: Slight deceleration in the fuel card business in the fourth quarter, the 5% from 6%, I believe, in Q3, any call outs specifically behind that? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, David, it's Ron. Same thing, I think the GFN thing widened just a shade from our estimates in the summer, so I'd say, that's probably a point of it. So again, we kind of say, we think without the GFN thing we'd probably be around 9% for the quarter for fuel. 
David Togut: So did GFN have a greater incremental negative impact in Q4 than it did in Q3? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. But more importantly, It had -- I'd say a couple of million more than our forecast from back in the summer. 
David Togut: And any commentary on -- like client retention in that portfolio? Has the retention stabilized? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I think obviously this is not our fondest topic. But I think the good news is we're kind of on the other side, all systems are green. We're selling back on the platform. Sequential retention of the base, that's on it is in line with where we think. So I think it's effectively over other than basically on the compares going forward. But we are finally on the other side of it. All fixed, people happy, back to normal. 
David Togut: Got it. Okay. And then performance of Cambridge global payments acquisition versus your buy plan? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, not super. I'd say it had a bit of a sluggish revenue Q4, and mostly, because we were working on restructuring. We exited some people. I think we've told you that we're pretty focused here on profit pools, and so that business has a very large number of small unprofitable clients. So there was a lot of energy in the quarter. Repricing and exiting what we think are a set of pretty unprofitable accounts. So that's going to result in big margin expansion for that business in 2018, and still I say, we're planning kind of mid-teens growth. So I'd say the plan that we have for '18 is pretty in line with the thesis we had this summer. 
David Togut: Understood. And then question on the cost structure, and realize these are GAAP numbers, general and admin expense at least on a GAAP basis was up 51% year-over-year. How much of that is onetime in nature versus sustainable in '18? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, so there's 2. And let start and I'll give it over to Eric. So there's a couple of things going on, one is a couple of onetime legal settlement kind of restructuring things in there, and then two, we greenlighted a bit of discretionary spend when we saw the business was tracking kind of ahead of our forecast particularly around IT, and a bit around some consulting projects. I'd say, ballpark probably about $20 million of this spend was one of those 2 flavors, either legal settlement flavor or a bit of a step up in discretionary spend. And then the balance is obviously the business mix, right? The fact that we own lower-margin assets, for example, like Cambridge in that quarter. You have any answer to that? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes, and just to add to that. I mean, again, just to add, the last thing that Ron said, I mean, don't forget, a year ago we did not own Cambridge, we did not own CLS, we did not own the private -- the small private-label account in Russia. So you've got the year-over-year impact of owning that business, which is actually the majority of the increase in revenue -- I mean, in expense. And then there's the 2 or 3 things Ron kind of packed on to that kind of added some expense in the fourth quarter. But most of that stuff was one time. 
David Togut: Got it. Just a quick final one for me. Net cash from operations was down about $39 million year-over-year in 2017 versus '16, and it looks like accounts and other receivables were up about $100 million year-over-year in terms of using cash. [ The ] call-out on DSO, was that -- is that business mix-related? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes. You know what? A lot of it had to do with the acquisitions. Again, don't forget that we added a lot of new business versus the prior year. We also made more tax payments this year than we did last year, which also impacted the cash flow from operations. But if I could remind that -- you that our business is very simple from a cash perspective. We bill and we collect. I mean, our DSO literally runs approximately 15 days. So we collect 99.995% of all of our receivables. So it all turns into cash. If there's any variances on the operating cash flow statement, it really is just timing. 
Operator: Our next question is from Darrin Peller with Barclays. 
Darrin Peller: Good trends. I just want to start off, you're mentioning for guidance mid-teens growth in the nonfuel areas other than gift. So corporate, tolls, lodging, it seems like those were growing. At least toll's up 20%, lodging up over 30%. So first of all, how is -- making sure lodging, that's organic, that's without CLS, I think, right? And then, why would those businesses, including corporate up 16%, decelerate to mid-teens, which is what it sounds like you're trying to imply in the guide? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Darrin. Hey, it's Ron. So the short story on CLC is we got some hurricane FEMA help in Q4 that probably gave us 10, 12 points of incremental growth. So that thing was still -- excluding the hurricane, a mid- to high-teens grower. And then on the other 2, I'd say, again, the comment I said to Ramsey, it's really kind of lapping some pricing so the compare gets steeper as you get later into the year, particularly in corporate pay and STP. So I would say those are the couple of reasons that something that's in the low-20s will be in the mid- to high-teens. But I do want to say, [ because ] it doesn't sound this way, we're happy. I mean, we're happy in this company to have 3 lines of business, that are half the company, grow in mid- to high-teens. I don't want you to miss that point. We're happy. 
Darrin Peller: No. Yes, we're not missing that. Just one quick follow-up and then some really -- a couple of technical questions. One of them is on the fuel price assumption. It looks -- I think you're using $2.57. I think the spot's closer to $3 now, so just a quick comment on that. And then on the gift business, you left us off last quarter thinking there could be something coming with regard to structural changes. Just wondering what's -- what the strategy there is now. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. So the fuel price, Darrin, is basically a mix of diesel and unleaded, and obviously, it mirrors the geographies and stuff that our client base is in. And so yes, sitting here at this moment, I'd say the number that we have in is a bit conservative. But as you know, that price can move, obviously, materially up or down. So if they stay where it is, there would be some upside in the plan. 
Eric R. Dey: So Darrin, just to add to that, that guide is really for only those businesses that are directly sensitive to the movement in the retail price of fuel, so it's primarily our fuel -- like our MasterCard businesses, as an example would not include Comdata as an example, which is obviously 95% diesel, because those businesses really don't react that much to changes in fuel price. So again, it's really those 2 businesses, and that business has more of a 50-50 kind of mix between gas and diesel. 
Ronald F. Clarke: What was your second part, Darrin? What was the second part of your question? 
Darrin Peller: Yes, the gift business strategy now. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. So we're still, I'd say, at the plate. I think what we said last time is the same, just slower. So we're on our third idea for that business and still actively working on it. So no news to report today. I think I said this last time. Hoping to have some news next time we talk. So we're still chopping wood on this idea we have. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: I guess, a question on -- so the nonfuel businesses at the mid-teens and maybe more the toll business. When we think about the growth rates you're anticipating, are you assuming any benefit from beyond fuel? And if not, when can we conceivably expect any upside to kick in? 
Ronald F. Clarke: So the first thing is the -- most of the beyond-fuel initiative is in our fuel segment. When we use that term, we're referring to our fuel card clients, primarily here and in the U.K., that buy only fuel, opening those cards and letting them buy some other things like construction supplies. But again, I said the same thing earlier, we're pretty happy with mid to high teens for the 3 nonfuel card businesses, and the reason that's decelerating a bit is they're lapping, again, the exit rate or the pricing. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Okay. And when we think about other initiatives within toll that I think you've talked about in the past, are we expecting some of those to kick off in 2018? Or is it more just -- more of the same in terms of organic growth? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, that's a great question. So again, the toll business, the STP business that we just reported in Q4 is 97% toll- and parking-related revenue. And then the third part is a little bit of fuel revenue for the people that use the toll product. So the big idea we have there is what we call fuel first, which, in English, means offering that same technology to consumers or businesses that don't go on the highway, so are not toll users. So effectively almost like a fuel card, people that go locally and go into the major branded stations would be able to avail themselves of the STP technology. So that opens up a market, call it, 5 to 10x the size of the market that we're in, and we've got a unique position having our STP [ gadgets ] in those locations and having those contracts. So we've got, I don't have it in front of me, probably circa $5 million to $8 million, I think, in our '18 plan for that initiative. So this is a "pilot and start to ramp it up" year. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Okay. Maybe just one quick follow-up on the reinvestment of the tax benefit, Eric. It sounded like 1/3 of it sort of maybe not recurring. Is that the way we should think about it? Or is the total reinvestment the recurring amount after 2018? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes, again, we're still developing some plans on exactly what we're going to invest in. I think, as Ron kind of mentioned, we're going to invest some money in some people, and then hopefully more sales investment into some other things to more protect the business. We don't have the exact number we're going to spend. We kind of called out about 1/3, but that would be something we would consider to be at least ongoing for now. It might change next year, but for now, we would expect that number to be in the business. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, just -- Sanjay, it's Ron. I'd say the only piece that feels a little bit more onetime in that third is the segment we call transformation projects. So we do have a couple of big kind of onetime things. We're trying to clean up and make better. I don't know if that's going to run for a year or a little bit more, but call it, 1/3 to 40% of the third Eric mentioned may be kind of more onetime-ish. 
Operator: Our next question is from Tim Willi with Wells Fargo. 
Timothy Willi: My first question, Ron or Eric, on the M&A front, when you think about some of the areas, I guess, around like fleets and payments, do you see opportunities to acquire businesses or technologies that might take you deeper into the value chain for, I guess, more of your larger fleet customers beyond just a transactional service that you provide? Is there something else where you see a logical, I guess -- to deepen that relationship and helping them manage their fleets and their businesses, et cetera? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I would say that, that's probably not a primary area that we're looking at. Again, I think our idea for deepening relationships are, A, to open up the cards and allow controlled purchases in adjacent space like for a big construction client, as an example. And then I think, B, the other deepening is the cross-sell into some of our clients our corporate pay and FX kinds of solutions. So I think that deepening idea is a little bit closer to kind of what we're in, in some of the divisions that we've got than it is something entirely new. 
Timothy Willi: Okay. And then my follow-up sort of related to that is, obviously, you've got a lot going on around [ work ] initiatives, and I think it touches on the last question around investing the tax savings. Would it -- just conceptually, as we think about -- out over the next, call it, 2 years, 3 years, as these new initiatives around expanding the categories and spend in Cambridge, et cetera, begin to take off, is that another leg to the margin story? Or is there an investment amount in here right now that's sort of suppressing the margins otherwise that we see more clearly as those initiatives move forward? 
Ronald F. Clarke: No, I don't think it's a margin enhancement. I think it's a revenue acceleration opportunity. So for us, we look closely at the sales and loss or retention metrics that we quote, and that math is penciling out to kind of 9%, 9% and 9%, right? We said 9% organic growth, '16; 9%, '17; and normalized kind of 8% to 10%, call it 9%. So 9, 9, 9. I think what we see is if we can get from those 4 or 5, what we call, big ideas or big initiatives to hunt, that, that provides potentially some revenue acceleration in those various businesses, particularly in the case of where it can be added on to a client we have. That would create a little bit of margin leverage, like getting existing clients to buy additional things. So I'd say that it's really more directed at revenue growth than it is margin. 
Operator: Our next question is from James Schneider with Goldman Sachs. 
James Schneider: Good to see the same-store sales stabilize at 2%, same as last quarter. Based on what you're hearing from your clients right now, I mean, do you think that, that could improve a lot or at all throughout the year from -- especially from some of the industrials clients? And maybe just kind of comment on whether your guidance just assumes that the same-store sales level continues as it is now. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Jim, it's Ron. So let me take the second part first. So our guidance, our plan for '18 is using roughly the average of '17. I don't have it in front of me, but that would pencil out to be somewhere between 1% and 2%. And again, that consolidated number that we quote is made up of lots of product lines in lots of geographies. And so mostly, what affects it is when pockets that may have been weak, like Brazil or Russia, start to strengthen or an industry type, like rail and our hotel business, tends to strengthen. I'd say those things seem to have more impact on the total number than, call it, the normal accounts that we would have in fuel or somewhere else. So we're planning it kind of consistent with the prior year, but who knows? Again, it's a macro assumption sitting out there. 
James Schneider: That's helpful. And maybe just as a follow-up, quickly on the MasterCard, the universal product, I know you started -- restarted sales there. Can you maybe give us a sense as to what point you can be back to the prior kind of like 8% to 10% growth rate? Is that sometime by Q2? Q3? How should we think about how we get back to that previous growth rate? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I think, if you looked at our plan, I think, as we lap the Q1, Q2 issue, it's double-digit starting in Q3 and Q4. So again, getting -- someone asked it earlier, getting the salespeople's confidence back on the product and that we're going to deliver it in a quality way, that builds a bit with time. But yes, the plan is to keep investing behind that product. And I think I mentioned that same product functionality running on the mainframe has continued to grow really nicely throughout the whole time, which reminds us that the product that we've got is good and is in demand. And so we just have to make sure we deliver it in a quality way. 
Operator: Our next question is from Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Great. Thanks for the presentation, too. It's helpful. Just the bookings. What sold well, guys? If you don't mind sharing, maybe by segment, just any other detail there. And I'm curious, given some of the pipeline for potential sold business this year, you think you can do better, worse, same as '18 that you posted in '17? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Hey, Tien-tsin, it's Ron. It's a great -- that's a great question. I'd say, sitting in our kind of close-of-the-year staff meeting in December, we remarked that, call it, out of 12 or 14 sales lines that we report and look at, I think all but one of them was up pretty significantly. So this is the first year that I can recall that kind of almost everything we have in the company in almost every place sold a bunch more than the prior year. And then, second, which I mentioned earlier, is the sales levels are accelerating. We did a lot better getting away from the distractions of the first half of the year. And so we planned sales a bit more conservatively for '18, but we like how things are rolling into the front of the year. 
Operator: Our next question is from Danyal Hussain with Morgan Stanley. 
Danyal Hussain: Just a couple of quick ones. Just on the Chevron contract. Does your guidance assume that the conversion begins sort of on day 1 in Q3? And then does that come off gradually or all at once? And do you expect there'll be any cost offsets in -- during the year? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Again, it's Ron. I don't think we'd comment that specifically on a given partner, but I'd say it'd be kind of okay for you guys to plan that we retain that thing for, call it, at least the first half of the year. I mean, practically all conversions have a beginning and end. So to your point, they actually stream over some period of time, usually 4 to 6 months. So that's what the shape of the thing will look like. 
Danyal Hussain: Okay, great. And then just a quick one on, I guess, M&A pipeline. You had suggested there might be a couple tuck-ins that are imminent, and then maybe just juxtaposing that against appetite for buybacks, I think, just given where the market is now. 
Ronald F. Clarke: [indiscernible] today, that's a more -- even a more relevant question. So yes, on the first part, I did mention that we've got 3 or 4 active acquisition things that we're working on. I would -- I guess, I'd characterize them as kind of mid-size. They're not super small, they're not super big, they're, call it, $100 million to $300 million or $400 million, $500 million kind of in size. So my guess is that we will work some of those through the pipeline before we get to the turn. And yes, on the question of buybacks, I think we've shown that we'll buy back FLT. We've bought back, whatever we said, 2.5 million shares... 
Eric R. Dey: 2.5 million shares. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, last year. And so like always, it's a function of relative price. So when we see the price of our stock vis-à-vis its comps and we look at our deal pipeline and we look at our liquidity, which are all good, our leverage ratio, I think, was 2.4 at the close, and so yes, I would say, at these kind of prices, we're certainly buyers of our stock. 
Operator: Our next question is from Oscar Turner with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. 
Oscar Turner: I guess, one more follow-up on this 2018 outlook. With regards to your nonfuel segments, can you provide a detailed growth outlook for those 3, I think it's tolls, Corporate Payments and lodging, just given that those are the revenue growth engine? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes, we did. I did provide some guidance on that. All of them are projected to grow kind of in that kind of mid- to upper-teens rate in 2018. We didn't talk about it specifically by product. I'd have to go back and look at it, but I would expect all of those, the tolls, the lodging, the corporate pay businesses, to be in the -- kind of the mid to upper teens. 
Oscar Turner: Okay. And then, appreciate the color on the midterm growth initiatives. I guess, my question's -- or follow-up's particularly on the beyond fuel. Can you provide color on the time line for broader rollout of beyond fuel? And then, I think you mentioned testing that with some of your domestic customers. And how much revenue from that initiative's in your 2018 guidance? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Oscar, it's Ron. It's a really good question. And so what I'd say is that we've done the iceberg work here in the U.S. and the U.K., so we now have lots of our fuel card clients on platforms that we can open up and offer nonfuel things to them, point one. Point two is we tested pretty hard for about 1.5 years in one vertical, the construction vertical, and had a lot of success with it. About half of the purchases of these new construction clients were construction supplies and the other half were fuel. So we've got good demonstration that this beyond fuel idea works, at least in some places. So what we're doing now, and is in kind of our plans for '18, is widening that and looking at other verticals, looking at our customer base to upgrade. So I'd say a lot of the work now is around targeting, marketing, credit analysis because it would increase obviously the credit for the accounts. So I would think that probably a fair amount of this year will be getting some other areas including the client base and other verticals fine-tuned so that it can be a much more material number next year. But it is working, wherever we tried it, it is working. 
Operator: And our final question will be from Bob Napoli with William Blair. 
Robert Napoli: Thanks for the outlook, the detailed outlook. But as we look at the numbers -- and mid-teens, I agree, are very healthy growth rates for those 3 segments. Where do you see the biggest risks to that outlook? Which businesses or which segments are you most confident in achieving those numbers? And so where could there be upside and where do you see -- if you missed these numbers next year, where would they -- which segment would it come from? Is it in -- where is the execution risk the highest? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Bob, it's Ron again. I'd -- it's a good question. I'd say that I'm not particularly worried about any of them because we've built plans, again, I think I'd tell you guys, that we think we can make. But I'd say that because of the model of Corporate Payments, I would have higher confidence because of the implementation cycle. So I'd say sitting here today, that book is sold already to make the plan. So the risk there is really implementation, not selling. But in the case of tolls and even lodging, those things have to be sold. We have to sell more in 2018, but obviously, we sold a lot in 2017. So I'd say, if you made me order them, I'd have the most confidence probably in corporate pay, probably second in lodging because this revamp of the product is just crazy good. We've taken a product that was not super easy to use or super easy to book rooms, low-cost rooms, and we've made it like super easy now. And looking at January, we're getting a lift. So I'd feel I'd say super good there. And so I'd say the one that's just more of proving to do that's just got a pretty big number would be the tolls business, would be my order. 
Robert Napoli: And which of those do you see the most likely to have upside potential, I guess? Would it be in the same order? 
Ronald F. Clarke: I'd say probably, for the same reason. Because beta flexes down and beta flexes up. I'd probably say the same thing. I was looking at the report this morning of the new tolls. I think I mentioned that in the upfront remarks. There's 4, I think, new toll roads expected to come online starting actually in Q2. So we've built some kind of forecast of the lift, which is -- starts to be pretty meaningful as you exit the year. So I'd say that, and then the common someone -- or question someone asked earlier about fuel first, I'd say the same thing. That thing is kind of ready to go. We're testing. We put a little bit in the plan, but from the research and the reactions, that's something that could roll way faster. So I'd say, although it has to all be sold in the year, which could create some risk, I think it's also got some flex where it could do a lot better. 
Robert Napoli: And last, I have to ask about Europe and fuel card outsourcing by the major oils which we've talked about for years. And you mentioned some potential major partnerships that could affect the numbers this year. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I'm always wrong, I feel like when I try to answer this question. So you guys have made me a bit cautious. But it's a bit of a broken record. Yes, I'm looking at some partner pipeline, and there are 3 or 4 things in Europe that we're in conversations but where and when those things will land, I don't know. But it continues to be something of great interest. I got an e-mail from one of my guys who had a great meeting yesterday and wanted to report back. The CEO, they want us to meet. So it continues to be of interest, but it always seems a bit harder to actually get it over the goal line. 
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.

===== 2017 Q3  (2017-11-01 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the FLEETCOR Technologies Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]
 As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
 I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Eric Dey, CFO. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead. 
Eric R. Dey: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. By now, everyone should have access to our third quarter press release. It can be found at www.fleetcor.com under the Investor Relations section.
 Throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information,  including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than other companies' similarly titled non-GAAP information. Quantitative reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today's press release and on our website, as previously described. Also, we are providing 2017 guidance on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis with a reconciliation of the 2.
 Finally, before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements. This includes forward-looking statements about our 2017 guidance, new products and fee initiatives and expectations regarding business development and acquisition. They are not guarantees of future performance and therefore you should not put undue reliance on them. These results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K and on our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Others are described in our annual report on Form 10-K. These documents are available on our website, as previously discussed, at www.sec.gov.
 With that out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay, Eric. Thanks. Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining the call this afternoon. Up front here, I plan to cover 3 subjects. First, I'll comment on the quarter and rest of year outlook. Second, I'll provide a brief update on some recent developments, happenings in the company. And then lastly, I'll talk a bit about our way forward from here and the opportunities that we see.
 Okay, so on to the quarter. We reported earlier good Q3 results; in fact, a bit better than our internal expectations. We reported revenue of $578 million, up 19%, and cash EPS of $2.18, up 13%. That exceeded the high end of our guidance range.
 The Q3 macro was positive, lifted revenues about $3 million in the quarter but unfavorable interest rates and unfavorable tax rates against the prior period took the favorability back. Same-store sales ticked up, were 2% positive in the quarter. And importantly, customer retention was 91%. That makes 10 consecutive quarters of 90%-plus customer retention.
 The hurricane impact was basically a push for us, overall. It did hurt our fuel card businesses that operate in Texas and Florida, but it did help our lodging business generate some incremental room nights through our FEMA contract. Everything now is back to normal.
 In terms of organic growth, revenue growth overall in the company, 8% for Q3, and our fuel card line of business, 6% for Q3. The GFN MasterCard conversion earlier in the year negatively impacted both our fuel card and overall organic growth, implying that the Q3 fuel card organic growth would have been about 3% better. So 9% instead of 6%. And our overall growth also would have been 9% instead of 8% if the MasterCard product line had come in on plan.
 In terms of drivers for the quarter, a few. So first up, STP, which we owned for the full quarter this year, added over $50 million of incremental revenue. It did grow 20% in local currency on a pro forma basis, which is terrific. And the STP credit losses were about half of the prior year's level. We did that through moving new accounts -- a lot of new accounts, to prepaid and implementing a new professional underwriting and collections group. So really good performance.
 We did get help in the quarter from the organic growth, particularly in our lodging and Corporate Payments businesses. Lodging up 18%, corporate pay up 17%. Speedway helped us in the quarter, now 95% converted. We did have some transactions in the quarter, the NexTraq telematics business, out. The Cambridge international payments business, in. And that mix gave us a bit of incremental revenue, but no incremental profit. The MasterCard business, as I mentioned, did go backwards in Q3 versus the prior period. But fortunately, it's consistent with our estimates from earlier this summer. Again, about a $15 million revenue shortfall for the second half versus our plan, is still where we are. And then lastly, we did get help from 2 million fewer shares in the quarter that was driven by the share buyback program.
 In terms of sales results, a terrific Q3. Sales grew 23% in the quarter versus the prior year. That sets an all-time record sales result for us. So really positive, new accounts on boarding our programs. Q3 cash flow, very strong, $240 million. That's up a lot from earlier in the year. So look, across-the-board, a pretty good quarter. Profit growth coming in above our expectations. Record sales, organic growth mostly in line with what we're looking for outside of the GFN MasterCard thing, accelerating STP performance. And finally, a tailwind, a little cooperation from the macro environment. So we're pretty pleased.
 Okay. Let me transition over to our rest of year outlook. So starting with the macro. We think continued favorable Q4 environment. Expect higher fuel prices and favorable FX, but unfortunately a continued drag from higher interest rates. So these assumptions, along with our current trends, result in the following 2017 guidance adjustments. We're raising full year 2017 cash EPS guidance today to $8.43 at the midpoint. This reflects our $0.05 beat in Q3, the $2.18 versus $2.13 and a $0.04 raise in Q4 to $2.30 per share to reflect a stronger macro environment. So the $8.43 would represent a 22% growth versus 2016's $6.92 print.
 So just if you recall, we did open guidance at the beginning of the year, in January, outlooking $8.20 for full year cash EPS and have raised that every quarter from $8.20 to $8.31 to $8.34 to $8.43 today.
 Okay, let me shift gears and talk about some recent developments company-wide. So first up, we announced a closing of a lodging tuck-in acquisition called CLS, which has got about $20 million in revenue. It's a pretty interesting business, looks a lot like our CLC business except it targets a different market segment. CLS focuses on polo shirt project people rather than blue collar or boots people. And these project people tend to stay longer, 6 nights-plus. So that gives us a new market segment to target.
 As part of the deal, we've identified some meaningful synergies, particularly on the hotel network side. We expect to arbitrage our better hotel rate as we bring the companies together. And some good news. The Founder and his management team have agreed to stay on, to keep running the business and help us with the integration plan.
 Second development, we did enter into a new major oil outsourcing contract with a gas [ Fram ] subsidiary in Russia. So we'll provide a full fuel card outsourcing services, much like we do for BP, Shell and Speedway. It represents about a $10 million revenue addition next year for us. And our hope is that it may further credential our capabilities with gas [ Fram ] or LUKOIL or Rosneft in Russia, maybe lead to more work with them over time.
 Third development, we did close Cambridge in August, the international FX payments company. We're now well into our transformation initiatives with them. Just a couple of things that I call out. So Cambridge historically has focused on pretty small accounts, about 10,000 of their 13,000 clients are quite small, have low rates and pretty high service requirements. So we're going to move away from these kind of super small accounts to more mid-sized or mid-market accounts that have a much more attractive profit pool. We're also going to refocus the sales efforts away from these small accounts. And we're going to put way more sales emphasis on the U.S. geography versus the Canada geography. So a little bit of a refocusing for Cambridge.
 Last thing going on, we are continuing to try to innovate and refine and test some new things in the company. So just a couple of examples. At STP, we're continuing to work on this pilot we call Fuel First. The idea there is to have a fueling-only program in Brazil at Shell stations in Brazil that would use STP's free flow RFID technology to speed drivers basically through the fuel -- refueling process without ever getting out of their car. And so the idea is to move from not only highway or toll drivers only, but to be able to target now kind of city or suburban drivers who don't go on the highway.
 Another new, new thing we're piloting is what we call Beyond Fuel. We're trying to open up our fuel cars to allow purchasing of adjacent spend categories like construction supplies or maintenance or lodging. Very positive reaction so far, although lots to do for us. Lots in the marketing, positioning, credit side, but interesting start there.
 We've also introduced what we think is the world's simplest fuel card customer UI. It allows a small business to interact with us in a really easy and intuitive way. The interface looks like a smart phone icon where you just toggle card parameters on and off. So quite positive.
 And then finally, we're testing what we call full AP outsourcing in our Corporate Payments business. So rather than going to a client and paying only a portion of their AP with a -- electronically, with a virtual card, we're going to go to prospective clients and say, hey, we'll take 100% of your AP and we'll pay it with a virtual card with ACH or even with a paper check." So we think this will appear to certain market segments, particularly smaller accounts that may not subscribe just to the virtual card offer.
 So the message here is a lot of new things being worked across the company. We're trying to attract new client segments, widen our opportunity. We're trying to capture some more existing spend from clients or, frankly, just to make it easier for our clients to work with us.
 Okay, so last up here are my thoughts on our way forward from here. So over the last 3 or 4 months, we've made a major push to: one, refine the objectives, goals for the company; two, to simplify the company and the portfolio or the lines of business that we're in; and three, to better prioritize our growth plans from here.
 So in terms of objectives, we want to reiterate our commitment to being a fast-growth company. We like fast growth and we want to offer top quartile growth. So we're reiterating our mid-term profit growth target of 15% to 20%. We'll continue to augment organic growth with acquisitions if they make sense or, alternatively, we'll return capital in a more deliberate and consistent manner if they don't.
 Second, in terms of the portfolio, we really are rebalancing and simplifying our portfolio, more lines of business really into 4 spend categories, so fuel, lodging, AP, and tolls. All of our acquisitions this year, Cambridge, CLS and the Russia deal have been about deepening our position in these existing 4 spend categories. We think each of these 4 categories has enormous potential. For example, the fuel card category alone, we estimate to have about $25 billion in global opportunity, and our current revenue's only about $1 billion.
 We do have a simple and unifying theme throughout the company. So every line of business, irrespective of the product line, the brand or even the geography has one purpose: to offer clients a better way to pay, an easier way to pay than their current method. I know it's simple but it's a share purpose for all of us.
 And then last, in terms of growth. Our growth plan is basically threefold. One, we want to add more clients. We've got about 800,000 clients today that we serve. We're going to invest more in sales and marketing outreach. We're going to try to develop new, new things that I mentioned earlier. So more clients. Two is, we want to capture more spend. So we're going to go to existing clients, try to capture some of their adjacent spend. We may be, over time, add a fifth spend category to the 4 that we're in today. And then third, we want more geography. We want to be deeper in Continental Europe, deeper in Asia. And again, we've only begun to play in those regions. So not very complicated but hopefully clear.
 So look, in conclusion, we believe we've got a business with terrific fundamentals and large markets. We've got advantaged positions in the spend categories that we serve, including a world-class fuel card franchise. So we hope that you share our excitement for continuing to build an even bigger, more diverse and more innovative payments company over time.
 So with that, let me turn the call back over to Eric. He'll provide some additional detail on the quarter. Eric? 
Eric R. Dey: Thank you, Ron. For the third quarter of 2017, we reported revenue of $577.9 million, up 19.3% compared to $484.4 million in the third quarter of 2016. The revenue from our North American segment increased 5% to $364.4 million from $345.9 million in the third quarter of 2016. However, excluding the NexTraq business, which was sold in July from both the 2016 and '17 results, revenue growth in our North America segment would have been 9%.
 Revenue from our International segment increased 54% to $213.4 million from $138.6 million in the third quarter of 2016.
 For the third quarter of 2017, GAAP net income increased 56.5% to $202.8 million or $2.18 per diluted share from $129.6 million or $1.36 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2016. Included in the GAAP numbers for the quarter are the impacts of selling the NexTraq business and changes in our investment arrangement in Masternaut that caused our accounting to change from the equity to cost method as we executed on our plan to exit the telematics space.
 The net impact of these events resulted in an approximate $65 million or $0.69 per diluted share favorable impact on our GAAP results. We have excluded the impact of these events in our adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share numbers.
 The other non-GAAP financial metrics that we routinely use are adjusted revenues and adjusted net income, which we sometimes also refer to as cash net income or cash EPS. Adjusted revenues equal our GAAP revenues less merchant commissions. A reconciliation of adjusted revenues and adjusted net income to GAAP numbers are provided in Exhibit 1 of our press release.
 Adjusted revenues in the third quarter of 2017 were $550.2 million, up 20.6% compared to $456.2 million in the third quarter of 2016. Adjusted net income for the third quarter of 2017 increased 10.6% to $202.8 million compared to $183.3 million, and adjusted net income per diluted share increased 13.4% to $2.18 compared to $1.92 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2016.
 Third quarter results reflect the impact of the macroeconomic environment. Changes in foreign exchange rates from the third quarter of 2016 were primarily positive. And overall, we believe positively impacted revenue during the quarter by approximately $4 million. Fuel prices were mostly favorable during the quarter and although we cannot precisely calculate the impact of these changes, we believe positively impacted revenues by $6 million. And finally, spreads were unfavorable as fuel prices increased during the quarter and we believe negatively impacted our revenue by approximately $7 million. So in total, the impact of those changes positively impacted our third quarter revenues by approximately $3 million and adjusted net income per diluted share by approximately $0.04 versus the third quarter of 2016.
 The impact of the macro was mostly in line with our expectations for the quarter. Organic growth was approximately 8% for the third quarter of 2017.
 Now let's shift over and discuss other drivers of our third quarter performance. Most of our major product categories performed well during the quarter. Our fuel card business grew 6% during the quarter on a macro neutral basis. And as a reminder, the fuel card business was impacted by the MasterCard conversion issues earlier in the year, which continue to negatively impact volumes and revenue for the portion of that MasterCard portfolio that was converted. And please note that if the MasterCard portfolio would have been at budget, we believe fuel card organic growth would have been approximately 9%.
 The Corporate Payments category continues to grow well and was up 17% organically during the quarter. Our STP business was up 20% organically and our lodging business was up 18%. The gift business was down 6% organically due primarily to the timing of card orders received. So all in all, another solid quarter for our business.
 Now moving down the income statement. Total operating expenses for the third quarter were $345.2 million compared to $293.4 million in the third quarter of 2016, an increase of 17.7%. As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses decreased to approximately 59.7% of revenue compared to 60.6% in the third quarter of 2016.
 Included in operating expenses are merchant commissions, processing expenses, bad debt, selling and general and administrative expense, depreciation and amortization expense and other operating net.
 Included in the third quarter of 2017 operating expense was stock-based compensation of $25.1 million compared to $18.1 million in the third quarter of 2016.
 Credit losses were $8.3 million for the third quarter or 5 basis points compared to $10.8 million or 7 basis points in the third quarter of 2016. The decrease in bad debt was primarily due to improvements in bad debt in our STP business, resulting from a move to more prepaid and implementation of a more professional underwriting and collections organization.
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 21.1% to $69.2 million in the third quarter of 2017 from $57.1 million in the third quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to the STP acquisition.
 Interest expense increased 64.7% to $29.3 million compared to $17.8 million in the third quarter of 2016. The increase in interest expense was due primarily to the impact of additional borrowing for the STP and Cambridge acquisitions and increases in LIBOR. Other income of $175.3 million was almost all from the pretax gain on sale of the NexTraq  business of approximately $175 million.
 Equity investment loss increased to $47.8 million in the third quarter of 2017 versus a loss of $2.7 million in the third quarter of 2016. Included in the third quarter of 2017 was an impairment loss of $44.6 million resulting from changes in our invested arrangement in Masternaut that caused our accounting to change from the equity to cost method as we executed on our plan to exit the telematics space. The write-down was primarily due to write-off of historical FX losses previously recorded in equity on the balance sheet.
 We also reported a loss on extinguishment of debt of $3.3 million due to the refinancing of our existing debt facilities to help finance the acquisition of Cambridge.
 Our effective gap tax rate for the third quarter of 2017 was 38.1% compared to 23.8% for the third quarter of 2016. The 2017 tax rate includes a gain on sale of the NexTraq  business of approximately $175 million, all at the higher U.S. tax rate and the Masternaut impairment charge in the quarter. Our cash tax rate in the quarter was 29.4%, excluding the impact of the NexTraq sale, equity method impairment and loss on early extinguishment of debt. The 2016 tax rate was favorably impacted by a onetime recovery of purchase price from our equity method investment that favorably impacted pretax earnings but was not subject to income tax. The 2016 rate was also favorably impacted by higher excess tax benefits on share-based compensation in the third quarter of 2016 versus the third quarter of 2017. And as a reminder, a change in accounting for stock-based compensation for tax purposes went into effect January 1, 2017, which resulted in the excess tax benefit on share-based compensation to be part of the effective tax rate and which the company adopted in the third quarter of 2016. This standard also requires a recasting of prior year results for comparability.
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1,018,000,000 in total cash. Approximately $184 million is restricted and consists primarily of customer deposits. As of September 30, we had $2,690,000,000 outstanding on our Term A loan, $350 million outstanding on our Term B loan and $673 million drawn on our revolver, leaving $612 million of undrawn availability. We had $794 million borrowed in our securitization facility at the end of the quarter.
 In the third quarter, we completed our previously announced $250 million accelerated stock repurchase program and also repurchased an additional $100 million of common stock out of the current authorized share repurchase program. In total, we purchased 2.4 million shares in the third quarter and a total of 4.1 million shares of common stock since the beginning of the program in 2016.
 In addition, our board increased the share repurchase authorization from the $160 million remaining in the existing authorization to a new total of $510 million. So a $350 million increase in the share buyback program.
 As of September 30, 2017, our leverage ratio was 2.53x EBITDA, which is well below our covenant level of 4.0x EBITDA as calculated under our new credit agreement. We intend to use our future excess cash flow to temporarily pay down the balance on our revolving credit facility and securitization facility and maintain liquidity for acquisition and other corporate purposes.
 Finally, we are not a capital-intensive business, spending approximately $17 million on CapEx during the third quarter of 2017.
 Now onto our outlook for the remainder of 2017. First, I want to update you on our latest thinking about the macro economic environment for the balance of the year. The good news is that in total, the macro came in mostly where we thought it would be in the third quarter. The current trend is for fuel price to be slightly ahead and market spreads to continue to be at our prior guidance level for the balance of the year. We also expect foreign exchange rates to continue to trend a little favorably compared to our prior guidance and interest rates to be a little worse. So in total, we are expecting the fourth quarter macro to be $0.03 to $0.04 favorable to our prior guidance.
 With that said, our financial guidance for 2017 is as follows: total revenues to be between $2,225,000,000 and $2,255,000,000; GAAP net income between $608 million and $618 million; GAAP net income per diluted share to be between $6.50 and $6.60; adjusted net income to be between $784 million and $794 million; and adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $8.38 and $8.48. This guidance represents approximately a 22% growth in both revenue and adjusted net income per diluted share for the year at the midpoint of the range.
 Some of the assumptions we've made in preparing this guidance include the following: weighted fuel price equal to $2.57 per gallon average in the U.S. for the fourth quarter for those businesses sensitive to the movement in the retail price of fuel; market spread at historic levels, no change from prior guidance; foreign exchange rates equal to the 7-day average as of October 5, 2017, a slight increase from prior guidance; interest expense of $110 million for 2017; and fully diluted shares outstanding of 93.5 million shares; a fourth quarter tax rate of 29.2%; fourth quarter guidance reflects the sale of the NexTraq business and the acquisition of Cambridge in the third quarter; and a neutral impact and adjusted net income from the CLS acquisition and new partner agreement in the fourth quarter; and no impact related to acquisitions or material new partnership agreements not already disclosed.
 So with that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ramsey El-Assal of Jefferies. 
Ramsey El-Assal: I wanted to ask, in the context of this new Russia deal, how the European outsourcing pipeline looks specifically for these sort of smaller regional programs. Forgetting about the giant brands that we've, I think, all been focused on for a while, is there more movement in the pipeline on the smaller end, not just in Russia but across Europe? And maybe will that be the sort of fit-in in to the wedge when it comes to opening up the market? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Ramsey, I don't think we know. We've called this wrong so many times, I kind of used to go out on a limb with you. But look, every one of these incremental, I think, helps, right? Maybe builds more confidence for other people to take the leap. And yes, there are smaller guys wading into the RFP stage now. So I'd like to sound even more hopeful, but given our past, I'm trying to be a little bit cautious. 
Ramsey El-Assal: All right. That's absolutely fair. And then, I wanted to ask about the Walmart agreement. I get the sort of acceptance side of that, but should I read that press release that now Walmart trucks in the U.S. are going to be using FLEETCOR cards? And can you just help us sort of size that deal? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, so you're reading it right. It's a 2-part deal; one is an exclusive acceptance deal for our kind of commercial cards, which should be quite helpful to us, right, because of their pricing; and the other one is really a competitive win. This is what we would call their light vehicle segment. Think of people driving around to their stores doing servicing versus the big trucks doing delivery. So it's about, oh, I think, it's just around 4,000 employees or vehicles. And it's 1 million-ish plus kind of contract, I'd say, in that ballpark. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: I guess, my first question is on the MasterCard conversion. I was just wondering, when we think about its impact going forward and relative to the previous quarter, does it deteriorate sequentially? And then, how should we think about it going forward? 
Ronald F. Clarke: It's Ron again. So the first thing I'd say is it's kind of going like we called it. So we made an estimate back 3 months ago and it kind of stayed on that curve. So sequentially, it's basically flat, kind of over these few quarters, inching up a bit, we think, in this quarter. And again, it's about $15 million off of our plan in the second half. So I think the way you ought to think about it, it will be soft again in Q1 because this thing happened at the end of Q1 and then start to lap at -- when we get into the second quarter next year. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Okay. And then, Ron, your comments on the 4 segments that you outlined. Is it fair to assume that then those are sort of the core segments that you're going to focus on? Or could there be other areas that you sort of plug into the model? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Again, we're -- I think that's a great question. We're more, as you guys know, about the model, but I do think we want a simpler company both to operate and communicate. So I'd say, evidenced by the deals that we've done this year, we're hunting a lot in those kind of 4 spend categories. But as you can imagine, there are 2 or 3 spend categories that look a lot like the 4 we're in, in terms of their structure. So I want to call out, hey, don't get shocked if we found our way into a fifth one. But with that said, I think you should assume the priority are these 4. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Darrin Peller of Barclays. 
Darrin Peller: I just want to start off, I mean, you obviously had, even beyond fuel, you had good growth over your main nonfuel card businesses. Really, I think I saw acceleration across all 3 of them. CLC growth was particularly strong. Maybe you can comment on what the hurricanes actually did to benefit that. And then, what are the CLS deal economics in terms of what does this contribute to you guys? And then,, a quick follow-up would be on the other 2 areas. I mean, 19% growth in tolls. I know pricing probably kicked in there. And corporate also, how sustainable are those trends in the high teens? 
Ronald F. Clarke: That, Darrin, is a multipart question. But let me try to go back to your first one. So CLC, yes, very good Q3. So kind of really 3 reasons. One is because it's been doing well, so we're obviously selling a lot more business than we're losing. So just one is the momentum we've had. Two is, we're now on the plus side of the same-store sales. We're up 3%, 4% on same-store there. And if you recall a year ago, we were actually on the other side due to the railroads and stuff. And so we've lapped that now and [ the thing's ] back, helping us. And then, I don't have it in front of me but I'm going to guess we've probably got, I don't know, 2 or 3 points of growth in Q3 from the incremental hurricane room nights. We'll probably, depending on the shape of that, get even a bit more here in Q4. So those would be the 3 drivers. Solid on its own, same-store on the plus column and a few points from the incremental FEMA rooms. Your second one was CLS? 
Darrin Peller: Yes. Just the economics around -- I mean, if you can give us more color on what kind of contribution that can have. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. The economics are -- looks -- it's kind of a lookalike to CLC. So if you think about both businesses, it's -- there's a street price for a room, let's say it's $100.  We have a buy rate based on volume, let's say $70 to pick a number, and we offer to the customer at $80. So the customer gets $20 off the lowest street price, we make $10 a [indiscernible] between the buy and the sell price. It's the same exact model for CLS. 
Darrin Peller: And is it a material contribution to your CLC overall segment now? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean, it's good for a couple of reasons. One is, we've been studying other segments, things that we're not in like the airlines, distressed segment is an example, the insurance segment is a segment. And then this one, which, internally we kind of call it the project segment, long stay segment. People -- 10 guys on a consulting trip that go for 15 days, so they buy whatever, 80, 90 rooms. So this company was kind of targeting that area and has a distribution model and a reference base to go get that. So that gets us into a market segment that we haven't been in, in a big way. But the great news is it uses almost an identical hotel supply side network. And obviously, we've got 10x, if you will, the volume in our network. And so we'll pick up obviously a lot of synergies there. 
Darrin Peller: Okay. Just quickly, the toll side. Pricing did kick in, I guess? I mean, is that growth profile almost 20%? 
Ronald F. Clarke: It did. I think, I try to say things that come true to you guys. So I think we said, hey, we're hoping to get to 20% at STP this year as we're exiting the year. And we got there a bit sooner. So we did print 20% for the quarter. We're outlooking about the same, 20%, for this quarter that we're sitting in. And yes, I'd say this quarter, we will be fully implemented with whatever pricing we're going to put in, we'll be in before we break for the holiday. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Danyal Hussain with Morgan Stanley. 
Danyal Hussain: Just, Ron, following up on that comment you made about moving to full accounts payable outsourcing for repayments. That sounds like it would pit you, I think, more directly with a lot of large commercial banks. Could you just talk a little bit about how -- or minus how you differentiate it, not just on the virtual card product but then ultimately, how you would differentiate it throughout accounts payable? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I think it's M&A side of the research that we did. So as we start to go down market, going into a smaller AP shop and pitching the virtual card as a new concept, it's just a bit more difficult for people to follow hey, which vendors will take it? What percent of the payments is it? What do I do with the rest of the stuff? And so there's been other people in the marketplace that have done this full AP outsourcing, a private company, in fact, it's a partner of ours called [ Avid ]. So we went into test 6 months ago, I guess, back in the spring to sign-up the first kind of 20 or 25 accounts. And what I'd say is, it's got a different appeal, which is really about simplicity for the account more than it is about economics or anything else. And so I think the answer is that we think it will be quite additive, that we'll be able to take that thing, target a bit smaller set of prospects for that and obviously grab more the value chain as well. Obviously, there's more dollars grabbing a bigger piece of the AP. So I'd say that it's just an extension of what we're doing but will be probably pretty additive. 
Danyal Hussain: Got it. And then, just a question on -- a two-part question, I guess, on gift and then organic growth. But gift was low. You were able to accelerate through that. So just talk a bit about your outlook for gift and what the plan is there. And then, more broadly, how you're thinking about organic growth, I think, against the context of your 10% target that you've historically focused on. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. So on the gift front, again, that business gets revenue from both processing and some margin on cards -- custom cards for custom accounts. And so it's bumpy. And so based on kind of shipping, it could have a really strong Q2 versus prior year and then a weak Q3 or vice versa. So it's a business that doesn't analyze well by quarter. It analyzes way more clearly by year. And so by year, it's going to be the same. This year, last year, kind of the low single-digit grower, 2%, 3%, 4% when all the dust settles for the year. And that's not different than it's kind of been since we bought it or different than what we planned. And yes, I know there's an old adage with the World Series on, 3 strikes and you're out, but we -- we're actually exploring yet a third idea. Our first idea was to look at selling the business if we get the right price, but we didn't like that with that tax leakage. Our second idea was to do this thing with First Data, and the antitrust didn't like it as well. And now we have a third idea that we're kind of excited about that we hope to report back on. So that's what we're doing. We're exploring a third alternative for that and should have some news the next time we talk. On organic, yes, we logged 8%. I think I mentioned in the opening that about a point of that was related to the losses from the MasterCard thing earlier in the year, so it would have been 9%. So kind of around the goal, the range that we had. I'd say, we're in the middle of our '18 budget now. So for me to give you something other than our aspiration of trying to be in the 8% to 12% kind of range is still what we're trying to do. And given that we got pretty stable on client retention for a few years, it’s really about the sales engine, which was good this quarter. So I'd say, again, we'll be specific when we talk to you the next time. But I think it's -- our aspiration is really the same. 
Operator: Our next comes from David Togut of Evercore ISI. 
Rayna Kumar: This is Rayna Kumar for David Togut. It's good to see the 2% same-store sales in 3Q, and I know you mentioned CLC was the driver. Are there any other key drivers in the quarter to that growth? 
Ronald F. Clarke: I had a little trouble with the beginning of the question. Can you just resay? You're not close to phone. Just say it again. 
Rayna Kumar: Can you just point out the key drivers to the 2% same-store sales growth? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Sure. Sure, I got it. So it's Ron again. So yes, I did mention that the CLC thing was up. Our Corporate Payments business, the base was super healthy other than the health care segments that we're in, direct segment, a reseller segment, a construction segment, those things were super high single-digit; healthy; crazy. But the 2 markets that have been crummy are Russia and Brazil, strengthened dramatically, both of them in the quarter. Both on the positive, the Brazil legacy business, without STP, was up 3%, 4%. And the Russia business was way up; and our Mexico business were way up. So 3 of the international markets that had been soft and kind of bringing the consolidated number down were all in the positive. Our Comdata big account business was super healthy, too. It was 2% or 3% positive. So lots of stuff kind of around flat, and then those 4, 5 that I called out, pretty positive. 
Rayna Kumar: Great. That's really helpful. Could you quantify the third quarter revenue growth rate in the U.S. MasterCard products? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Which MasterCard product? I think, I said at the opening that the converted portfolio was actually down, it was actually backwards. We actually had less revenue in Q3 of this year -- I think Q3 of last year because we lost, I think, I told you, 1/4 or 1/3 of that book of business. The rest of the portfolio of MasterCard on the print was up 16% in the quarter. So it's a tale of 2 cities. 
Rayna Kumar: Great. And just lastly, if you can talk about the third quarter revenue and earnings growth rate at Cambridge and your expectations for 2018. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. We owned -- I don't have it in front of me. We've owned Cambridge for whatever, half the period. I have the full year. I think we're looking at 15% to 16% on a pro forma basis in the local currencies for this year for calendar '17. And again, I don't have it in front of me, but based on the thesis, the business case to buy the thing, similar, kind of somewhere in the 15% to 17% range, I think, was our outlook for '18 for that business. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. 
James Schneider: Maybe if you can just provide a little bit of a clarification on what you're seeing for the -- whether you've actually restarted sales -- excuse me, on the MasterCard universal product. I think you had talked about that being kind of a 1- to 3-month lag. Can you confirm that those sales have restarted at this point? And if not, when will you expect to do that? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Jim, it's Ron. Yes, that's a good question. Yes is the answer. We have, I think -- what are we now? November? Sometime in October, early October, we began to resell on the same platform, right, [indiscernible] came across. So we want to make sure that the thing was not only stable but working well, so the salespeople that put new clients on it were going to have a good experience. So we can confirm that we're now back to onboarding new business finally. 
James Schneider: Good to hear. And then, maybe as a follow-up, regarding the Corporate Payments business, I think, Ron, you give a little bit of color on how you're retargeting or refocusing the Cambridge people. But can you maybe talk about some of the cross-sell opportunities you talked about before kind of selling the Comdata corporate products to Cambridge clients or Cambridge products to the Comdata customers? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. We actually literally had a call, a review yesterday on this subject and we barely have formalized it and they've already made some deals. So it was a quite fun call for me to hear that our thesis has taken shape before we've even officially launched the thing. But the plan there is -- the initial focus is going to be that the Comdata virtual card going to Cambridge. And the reason is 100% of Cambridge clients have domestic AP. So every single client's a target. So what they've done is we've taken the Cambridge U.S. base, prioritized it, took, I don't know, 400 or 500, we think, of the best targets in terms of verticals and stuff and in the process of dedicating 4 or 5 people from our virtual card business to buddy up with the Cambridge people that have those relationships and press ahead and see what kind of reception we get as we get introduced. So that thing is formally, literally just getting lift-off today. But informally, they've already made some deals or a couple of deals in the legal vertical already where our people had gone in with the Cambridge legal account team and made a couple of sales. So it's super early days, but we're pretty optimistic about it. The other way, the reciprocal side, Jim, we're going to hold the horses on. There's less opportunity obviously going the other way because less of the Comdata base clients will have international payments to make via smaller -- much smaller percent. 
James Schneider: Understand. And then, quick clarification, if I could. You previously had talked about 2 European RFPs in the pipeline. Is the Russia deal -- you just announced 1 of those 2, and do you still anticipate another one to follow in the next 3, 6 months? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, is the second part of the question. There were 2. I hope I didn't say there were 2 in Europe. I said there were 2 that are active. One of them was in Europe, which we announced today. And the second one is somewhere else and it is active and we've been told it's a Q1 decision. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Oscar Turner of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. 
Oscar Turner: So I appreciate the insight into your growth opportunities. My question is on the Beyond Fuel program. How should we think about which of your clients this could apply to from a size or industry perspective? And to the extent you've tested it thus far, can you give any high-level color on the amount of spend upside that can be realized? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Oscar, it's Ron again. So again, I'd say it's pretty early days. We've tested it specifically against the construction industry, which is about 1/4 of our U.S. client base. And so we went out again starting in the beginning of this year with an offer to provide both a fuel card and a construction supplies card in one, and that's all you can buy on it. And we built about an $8 million run rate business in revenue from that initiative. It's about 50-50. About half of the spend in revenue is fuel and the other half are other supplies. So I'd say that our idea is obviously much, much broader than that. It's to look at lots of verticals and both small and large clients and figure out what adjacent spend, which would be interesting for them to put on this "one account" with us, particularly spend. It's the same employees, right, that are using our cards. So we're working through those various kinds of positionings and importantly credit dynamics to figure that out. But look, it's a whopper number, right? Fuel represents, if you carve out the trucking business, a small portion of our client spend generally. There's way more business spend in travel and purchasing and other kinds of areas. And so, I think it’s just a function of how wide and how much adjacent spend we can get, but it's a really significant upside if we can interest our clients in using our card for that. 
Oscar Turner: Okay. And then, second question just on Walmart. How can we think about the yield on transactions at Walmart versus the rest of your fleet business? And then, I'd assume the volume pickup there would more than offset any lower pricing. 
Ronald F. Clarke: When you say on the first part, are you talking about the acceptance where Walmart would accept our commercial cards? Or you're saying on... 
Oscar Turner: Yes. The acceptance part. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay. Yes. So I guess a good way to think about that is, yes, we've obviously reached a deal, a merchant discount deal with Walmart at their locations. I think, the reason it can work is that their pricing tends to be quite competitive, quite attractive. And so we think that, one, we'll get some incremental lift from accounts that we have. And two, maybe we'll sign up some accounts in the regions where they've got good position. So in the modeling that we've done, despite maybe having a bit narrower deal with them and some other merchants, we think it'll generate incremental economics for us. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2017 Q2  (2017-08-03 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings. Welcome to the FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
 I would like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Eric Dey, Chief Financial Officer for FLEETCOR Technologies. Thank you. You may begin. 
Eric R. Dey: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. By now everyone should have access to our second quarter press release. It can be found at www.fleetcor.com under the Investor Relations section.
 Throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than other companies' similarly titled non-GAAP information. Quantitative reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today's press release and on our website, as previously described. Also, we are providing 2017 guidance on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis with a reconciliation of the 2.
 Finally, before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements. This includes forward-looking statements about our 2017 guidance, new products and fee initiatives and expectations regarding business development and timing of acquisitions and dispositions. They are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore, you should not put undue reliance on them. These results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K and in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Others are described in our annual report on Form 10-K. These documents are available on our website, as previously discussed, at www.sec.gov.
 With that out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay. Eric, thanks. Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining the call this afternoon. Upfront here, I'll plan to cover 2 subjects. First, I'll comment on our Q2 results and rest of year outlook. And second, I'll provide an update on some recent developments.
 Okay, so on to the quarter. We reported very good Q2 results, generally consistent with our internal expectations. We reported revenue of $541 million, up 30%; and cash EPS of $1.99, up 26%. That's back-to-back quarters of profit growth above 25%.
 The macro overall was a nonfactor in our Q2 earnings. Fuel price and fuel spreads were a bit favorable, but FX, interest rates and our tax rate were unfavorable versus the prior year. So again, overall neutral macro against profits.
 Organic growth, 9% in Q2 with fuel card revenue growth of 8%. Revenue growth in our other 4 major product lines was double digit. That excludes our all other category. 
 Same-store sales finally strengthened in Q2 to plus 1%. We had particular strength in lodging and corporate payments. Q2 sales grew 7% versus prior year, with 2 of our smaller international markets, Mexico and Russia, grew sales 100% versus last year. Q2 cash flow expanded to $125 million, up 40% versus last year and up $70 million sequentially versus Q1 '17. Q2 global customer revenue retention was 91.5%. That's 9 consecutive quarters of 90%-plus retention.
 So in terms of drivers for Q2. Basically, 3 things. One, STP made a big contribution. We didn't own that last year. It grew 14% on a pro forma basis. Again 9% organic growth, about $40 million flowed through into earnings. And last, we had about 1 million fewer shares outstanding.
 I do want to point out that a few things did not go as well as we planned in Q2. The Comdata MasterCard portfolio that we didn't convert in Q1 suffered some onetime losses in Q2 due to a bumpy IT conversion. Fortunately, the U.S. MasterCard portfolios that we didn't convert to a new platform continued to grow quite well, up 34% in the quarter. So the one we converted, not so good; the ones that we didn't convert, still growing nicely.
 Our Comdata trucking money movement products, eCash and Comcheks, are quite soft in the quarter. We're moving to replace both of those with new fresher versions. And STP was just a bit delayed in some of its pricing actions as we chose to test our way in a bit more slowly.
 But look, all in all, a good solid quarter, good profit growth and really kind of a good first half of 2017.
 Okay, let me transition over to the outlook for the rest of the year. Starting with the macro. So basically, outlooking neutral macro for the second half. FX will be better. Interest rates will be worse. But on an overall basis, neutral for rest of the year.
 Operating performance should be quite similar to Q2. Things that are going well will continue to go well. There's a couple of soft spots, the Comdata MasterCard portfolio that we converted and the Comdata money movement products probably soft still for around -- for the second half, but expect an acceleration in our corporate payments business. They brought on a lot of new business that will get implemented in the second half that's been previously sold. And STP will gain on some of the pricing initiatives and some of the new channel -- sales channel initiatives in the second half. Speedway should be fully ramped by September heading into Q4, and we continue to roll out these Pac Pride extended network cards. So these set of positives should absorb a couple of the weaker spots that we mentioned.
 And then finally, we're expecting a rebalancing of our portfolio here in the second half, replacing our telematics business, Nextraq, with our international payments business, Cambridge. So obviously, that trade should result in faster revenue growth next year.
 So these expectations result in the following 2017 guidance adjustment: We'll raise full year 2017 cash EPS guidance $0.03 from $8.31 to $8.34 at the midpoint. So this -- that reflects a $0.03 beat here in Q2, effectively leaving our rest of year guidance unchanged. This guidance assumes the portfolio rebalancing I mentioned; Nextraq out, Cambridge in. That will be about $0.03 unfavorable in the second half, but that will be offset by the ASR, which will be $0.03 favorable in the second half.
 Our second half organic growth overall should pencil out at around 8% or 9% with slower fuel card growth in the second half, again due to that bumpy MasterCard conversion.
 Okay, let me shift gears and talk about some recent developments. So first up, on the capital allocation front. We announced we just refinanced our term debt facility increasing our liquidity and extending our maturity. So we raised another $700 million in term debt favorable rates. The term A and revolver staying put at L 175 and the term B rate improving 25 bps to L plus 200. Term A revolver maturity extended 5 years; and the B, 7 years. And that raise was oversubscribed. 
 We also completed our telematics Nextraq sale to Michelin for $320 million in July, so we now have that cash. So basically, this new raise and sale gives us the available liquidity to close and fund Cambridge, fund the $250 million ASR, potentially do more open market share buybacks or acquisitions going forward. And looks like it will leave our pro forma leverage ratio at year-end at under 3x, our target.
 On the partner relationship front, some good progress this quarter. We're delighted to announce that Uber has extended their relationship with us, so happy to continue to grow that program with them. Speedway, we progressed the implementation quite nicely, now 75% complete, expected to finish in September. That will lift revenues in Q4 and into next year, so that conversion going well. And we've also gotten closer to some decisions on some new international partner opportunities, so hopeful that a couple things there will come to a conclusion.
 On the acquisition front. Cambridge, expect to close Cambridge by September 1. We've now received regulatory clearance. We've received approvals and/or waivers for all the necessary state money transmitter licenses. We finalized our year 1 transformation, integration plan and appointed one of our executives to lead the transformation effort. Cambridge is out looking 20%-plus revenue growth in calendar '17.
 You may have seen the SVS announcement. We have decided mutually with First Data to terminate our gift card JV. The challenge, time line and costs associated with the regulatory process, is what led us to reconsider the decision and move forward independently, retaining SVS. We're in the process now of reworking our growth plan for SVS, and we'll revert with those thoughts and ideas later this year.
 STP, hard to believe but coming up on our 1-year anniversary. That acquisition business performing well, low teens revenue growth in the first half. Many of our transformational initiatives now taking hold. Some pricing, lower credit losses, traction on some new sales channels and testing of a new revamped IT system, so quite pleased so far with STP and its prospects.
 In terms of pipeline, we are still active, working some new potential acquisitions, specifically a couple attractive tuck-ins. So we'll keep you posted as we get closer there.
 Let me give you an update on system conversion or migrations. We've worked on 3 IT conversions in the first half of 2017. Two have gone well or very well and 1 has gone not so well. So on the good news front, we did convert our Comdata processing mainframe infrastructure from running in the Comdata office building to running on the IBM cloud. This is good. It's -- it helps in terms of processing speeds, it will lower our IT costs going forward and it gives us better disaster recovery if we should ever need it.
 Second conversion. I mentioned earlier Speedway. We've converted 75% of that portfolio to FLEETCOR systems. The conversion has gone well -- quite well, and again, expect to wrap that up in Q3. 
 On the not-so-good front, we converted a portion, one of our direct MasterCard portfolios off of the Comdata mainframe in Q1. We had problems converting the history or client balances. That led to several weeks of delays in billing, some errors in billing, unfortunately long wait times in customer service. And as a result, we've seen a number of clients leave the program in Q2 because of those bumpy IT issues. Fortunately, we've now corrected those conversion issues. The service is running normally again. And client attrition seems to have plateaued, so we're back at trying to rebuild that portfolio.
 So look, in conclusion, again a good Q2, good growth, 26% profit growth, back-to-back quarters of 25%-plus profit growth. Basically, a neutral macro environment here in Q2 and previously in Q1. And overall, we're out looking basically a neutral environment rest of the year. So glad to be off that subject.
 Our second half outlook is up sequentially, expecting 20% profit growth for full year 2017. We're rebalancing the portfolio, the faster-growth businesses. Nextraq out, Cambridge in. We're strengthening our capital base, returning capital to shareholders, still increasing our liquidity and still maintaining a less-than-3x leverage ratio. Still on the hunt for some new partner deals and have extended our relationship with Uber. And we feel like we're past the distractions of the first half and getting back to work, back to business. So net-net, we feel pretty well positioned to finish the rest of '17 strong and take some of that momentum into 2018.
 So with that, let me turn the call back over to Eric. Eric? 
Eric R. Dey: Thank you, Ron. For the second quarter of 2017, we reported revenue of $541.2 million, up 29.5% compared to $417.9 million in the second quarter of 2016.
 The revenue from our North American segment increased 14% to $343 million from $301.1 million in the second quarter of 2016. Revenue from our international segment increased 70% to $198.2 million from $116.8 million in the second quarter of 2016.
 For the second quarter of 2017, GAAP net income increased 12.7% to $131 million or $1.39 per diluted share from $116.3 million or $1.22 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2016.
 The other financial metrics that we routinely use are adjusted revenues and adjusted net income, which we sometimes also refer to as cash net income or cash EPS. Adjusted revenues equal our GAAP revenues less merchant commissions. A reconciliation of adjusted revenues and adjusted net income to GAAP numbers are provided in Exhibit 1 of our press release. Adjusted revenues in the second quarter of 2017 were $510.6 million, up 29.1% compared to $395.6 million in the second quarter of 2016.
 Adjusted net income for the second quarter of 2017 increased 24.7% to $187 million or $1.99 per diluted share compared to $150 million or $1.57 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2016.
 As a reminder, 2016 adjusted net income per diluted share reflected the impact of adoption of the new accounting rules for stock option-based compensation.
 Second quarter results reflect the impact of the macroeconomic environment. Changes in foreign exchange rates from the second quarter of 2016 were primarily negative and overall, we believe, negatively impacted revenue during the quarter by approximately $5 million. Fuel prices were mostly favorable during the quarter. And although we cannot precisely calculate the impact of these changes, we believe positively impacted revenues by approximately $5 million.
 And finally, spreads were favorable as fuel prices dropped during the quarter, which increased market spread margins. As a result, we believe spreads positively impacted our results by approximately $15 million. So in total, the impact of those changes positively impacted our second quarter revenues by approximately $15 million and adjusted net income per diluted share by approximately $0.05.
 Organic growth was approximately 13% for the second quarter of 2017 or 9% when excluding the impact of the macroeconomic environment.
 Now let's shift over and discuss other drivers of our second quarter performance. All of our major product lines performed well during the quarter. Our fuel card business grew 13% during the quarter and 8% on a macro-neutral basis. The fuel card business was impacted by the MasterCard conversion in the first quarter, as Ron mentioned earlier, which impacted volumes and revenue for the portion of that MasterCard portfolio that was converted. However, the U.S. MasterCard portfolios that we did not convert continued with their fast growth and were up over 30% in the quarter. Although the conversion issues have been mostly resolved, we do expect that volumes in the converted portfolio will continue to lag the rest of the year.
 Our corporate payments business continues to grow well and was up 12% during the quarter. Our tolls business was up 13%, lodging was up 16% and the gift business up 11%. So all in all, another solid quarter for our businesses.
 Now moving down the income statement. Total operating expenses for the second quarter were $325.2 million compared to $246.7 million in the second quarter of 2016, an increase of 31.8%. As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses increased to approximately 60% of revenue compared to 59% in the second quarter of 2016. Included in operating expenses are merchant commissions, processing expenses, bad debt, selling and general and administrative expense, depreciation and amortization expense and other operating net. Included in the second quarter of 2017 operating expense were ongoing expenses related to the acquisitions closed in 2016. Also, stock-based compensation expense in the second quarter of 2017 was $21.2 million compared to $17.6 million in the second quarter of 2016. And deal-related expenses were approximately $1.2 million in the second quarter of 2017 versus approximately $300,000 in the second quarter of 2016.
 Credit losses were $14.7 million for the second quarter or 9 basis points compared to $6.9 million or 5 basis points in the second quarter of 2016. The increase in bad debt was primarily due to bad debt inherent in the acquired STP business and the addition of new euroShell locations and, to a lesser degree, normal quarterly fluctuations of certain businesses.
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 33.6% to $64.7 million in the second quarter of 2017 from $48.4 million in the second quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to the STP acquisition. Interest expense increased 50% to $23.9 million compared to $15.9 million in the second quarter of 2016. The increase in interest expense was due primarily to the impact of additional borrowings for the STP and Travelcard acquisitions and increases in LIBOR. 
 Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2017 was 31.2% compared to 28.4% for the second quarter of 2016. The 2016 tax rate was favorably impacted by a onetime recovery of purchase price from our equity method investment that favorably impacted pretax earnings but was not subject to income taxes.
 The 2016 rate was also favorably impacted by higher excess tax benefits on share-based compensation in the second quarter of 2016 versus the second quarter of 2017.
 As a reminder, a change in accounting for stock-based compensation for tax purposes went into effect January 1, 2017, which results in the excess tax benefit on share-based compensation to be part of the effective tax rate. The standard also requires the recasting of prior year results for comparability.
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $765.6 million in total cash. $201 million is restricted and consists of primarily customer deposits. As of June 30, we had $2.3 billion outstanding on our term A loan, $244 million outstanding on our term B loan and $506 million drawn on our revolver, leaving $529 million of undrawn availability. We had $741 million borrowed on our securitization facility at the end of the quarter.
 On July 17, we closed the sale of the Nextraq business for $320 million in cash or about $255 million after tax.
 Today, we announced the successful upsizing of our senior credit facility by $709 million and extended the facility to a new 5- and 7-year terms on the term A and B facilities, respectively. The lenders have agreed to an amendment that increases the term A loan to $2,690,000,000, increases the revolver loan to $1,285,000,000 and increases the term loan B to $350 million. The term loan A and revolving pricing remains the same, currently LIBOR plus 175 basis points. And the term B pricing was reduced by 25 basis points to LIBOR plus 200 basis points. 
 We intend to use this new facility to help finance the Cambridge acquisition and provide liquidity for future share buybacks and M&A.
 Today, we also announced that the Board of Directors has authorized an increase in the previously announced share repurchase plan from $500 million up to $750 million and extended the share repurchase plan by 18 months.
 We also announced that it has entered into a $250 million accelerated share repurchase program, under which we will repurchase 250 million of our common stock. This ASR is part of the $750 million authorized amount. We plan to use the proceeds from the Nextraq sale to finance the ASR.
 The company had previously spent approximately $240 million under this plan and has repurchased approximately 1,670,000 shares at an average price of approximately $144 per share.
 As of June 30, 2017, our leverage ratio was 2.64x EBITDA, which is well below our covenant level of 3.75x EBITDA as calculated under our credit agreement.
 We intend to use our future excess cash flow to temporarily pay down the balance on our revolving credit facility and securitization facility and maintain liquidity for acquisitions and other corporate purposes.
 Finally, we are not a capital-intensive business, spending $17.8 million on CapEx during the second quarter of 2017.
 Now on to our outlook for the remainder of 2017. First, I want to update you on our latest thinking about the macroeconomic environment for the balance of the year. The good news is that in total, the macro came in mostly where we thought it would be. The current trend is for fuel price and spread to continue to be at our prior guidance level for the balance of the year. And although foreign exchange rates are trending a little favorable to our prior guidance, higher interest rates will offset the slight macro gain, so about neutral when you include interest.
 Also, we have a lot of moving parts for our guidance this quarter, including the sale of Nextraq during the quarter, which will create a headwind for the rest of the year but will be somewhat offset by the previously announced Cambridge acquisition, which is expected to close by September 1, and the impact of the accelerated stock repurchase program. The good news is that on an annualized basis, these events are cumulatively accretive, but they will not be for the balance of the year purely because of timing.
 With that said, our financial guidance is as follows: total revenues to be between $2,195,000,000 and $2,245,000,000, GAAP net income between $545 million and $565 million, GAAP net income per diluted share to be between $5.80 and $6, adjusted net income to be between $775 million and $795 million and adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $8.24 and $8.44. This guidance represents approximately a 20% growth in revenue and 20% growth in adjusted net income per diluted share for the year at the midpoint of the range.
 Some of the assumptions we have made in preparing this guidance include the following: weighted fuel prices equal to $2.43 per gallon average for 2017 in the U.S. for those businesses sensitive to the movement in the retail price of fuel; market spreads returning closer to historical levels, no change from prior guidance; foreign exchange rates as of June 30, 2017, a slight increase from prior guidance; the SVS business is retained for 2017; interest expense of $108 million for 2017; fully diluted shares outstanding of 94 million shares, and this assumes approximately a 600,000 share impact from the ASR for the rest of the year; a full year tax rate of 29.2%.
 As a reminder, a change in accounting for stock-based compensation for tax purposes went into effect January 1, 2017, which allows for the excess tax benefit on share-based compensation to be part of the effective tax rate.
 As a result, the tax rate can be volatile and is impacted by the number of stock options exercised or restricted shares vested in a quarter. The company believes that the balance of the year tax rate could fluctuate between approximately 29% and 31%.
 The Nextraq business was sold on July 17 and is not included in the company's rest of year guidance. The impact of removing Nextraq is approximately $0.08 in adjusted net income per diluted share for the remainder of the year based on our prior guidance, and the company estimates it will recognize a gain on the sale of Nextraq of approximately $90 million or $0.95 per diluted share and is not included in guidance.
 The company anticipates that the Cambridge Global Payments acquisition will close by September 1 and is, therefore, included in guidance. The impact of the Cambridge acquisition on our second half guidance is approximately $0.04 to $0.05 in adjusted net income per diluted share and no income related to acquisitions or material new partnership agreements not already disclosed.
 In summary, our guidance for the full year builds as follows: previous guidance range of $8.21 to $8.41, add the $0.03 Q2 beat of our Q2 guidance, remove the sale of Nextraq for the remainder of the year of approximately $0.08 in adjusted net income per diluted share, add the impact of the Cambridge acquisition of approximately $0.04 to $0.05 in adjusted net income per diluted share net of deal-related expenses, add the impact of the $250 million ASR on the balance of the year of approximately $0.03 in adjusted net income per diluted share, which equals our revised full year guidance range of $8.24 to $8.44.
 In terms of guidance for the third and fourth quarters, I want to remind everyone that the company's revenues and profits normally build sequentially throughout the year, resulting in higher revenue and profit in the third and fourth quarters. Also the above-mentioned items will impact revenue and profit in the third and fourth quarters. As a result, we believe our revenue and profit in the third quarter will be higher than the second quarter and our revenue and profit in the fourth quarter will be higher than the third quarter, driven by the timing of the above items. For the third quarter, we are expecting adjusted net income per diluted share to be in the range of $2.09 to $2.16.
 With that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Jefferies. 
Ramsey El-Assal: I was wondering if you could talk about your organic growth trajectory kind of moving through Q4 and then to early 2018. I know you called out a lot of kind of puts and takes and some factors that might point to some acceleration there. I was just wondering if you could kind of help us think through what that rate will be into 2018. 
Eric R. Dey: Ramsey, this is Eric. I would say our range is pretty consistent with where we've been in the past. I mean, to kind of give a range, I would say we're kind of in the 8% to the 10%, 11% range is where we'd think about where we're going to be next year, give or take. We obviously haven't spent a lot of time building our 2018 budget at this point, but that would be our expectation if I had to say it right now. 
Ramsey El-Assal: And then I guess, on a related note, now that STP is going to cycle soon, I mean, what's the growth rate in that asset, in that business that you're anticipating going forward? Are we -- should -- I'm assuming we're expecting to see some acceleration there as some of your programs kind of take -- gain a little more traction, is that a fair assumption? And if so, could you help us kind of quantify what that rate might be? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Ramsey, it's Ron. So kind of first half, I think I said low teens. I think the second half will be closer to high teens to 20%. And I'd say we would stay at that level probably at least the first 6 months of next year and then probably mid to high teens. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. And then lastly, I wanted to ask you about the Uber deal, which sounds very interesting. As I recall before, that was a really fast-growing contract. What is the nature of the extension? Are you rolling this out to a much broader group of drivers? Is it a broader geography or just more -- different types of drivers in the U.S.? And could you kind of help us think through the model there that you're evolving into and then also potentially what the impact might be in the numbers. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. So the short answer is it's just more term. They're happy, we're happy, so they added more term to the existing deal. We're still trying to figure out how to take the program internationally, so that's still a work in process. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. 
David Togut: What was the growth rate in the direct MasterCard product in the second quarter? And how would you expect that to look in Q3 and Q4? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Which is the direct -- you're saying direct MasterCard? 
David Togut: Right. So the interchange-centric product, you called out some issues with portfolio conversions. Historically, you'd give an overall growth -- revenue growth number for that business, sometimes unit, sometimes revenue as well. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I don't have it handy. I think what we quoted is our collective set of U.S. MasterCard products, I think, was a combo of the one we converted which went a bit into the ditch and the ones we didn't grew 34. I think the combination of all of those was plus 17%. The happy stuff that didn't convert and the sad stuff that convert, I think the consolidated number was 17%. 
David Togut: And how would you expect that to trend in the back half of this year? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Well again, I would say per my comments, likely down, right? I tried to be as transparent as possible that we took a bit of a divot in this conversion. We did the conversion, and it took a while to get a read on it. And basically, the read of what we converted was not great. So we'll see obviously more of that as we go into kind of Q3 and Q4. So that particular portfolio will probably be flat over the next couple of quarters. And the other 5 or 6 MasterCard portfolios, we would expect will continue growing at a pretty -- 20%-plus rate. So that's -- so I'd say it's still unclear, David, what the shape of that particular file that we converted, but we forecasted it to be kind of flat the next couple of quarters. 
David Togut: Understood. And then you called out a 1% growth in same-store sales, which is a nice improvement. Could you sort of drill down into the drivers of that, perhaps by geography? I mean, just where do you see the biggest changes in same-store sales? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Again, as you know, it's across a lot of places, but I'd say the Brazil thing got better. The employment piece, at least the line of business we're in the -- transport piece got significantly better. The lodging piece, which, I think, we had on our [ excuse sheet ] a year or so ago is in the rearview mirror. Those things are now back to positive. The corporate payments business was quite healthy to date. So I think it's -- again, when we hit this consolidated number, I think, was 1 point, 1.5 points negative. It's 4 or 5 pieces, David, moving in the right direction that brings kind of the total from minus 1 to plus 1. So it's not one thing. It's literally probably 4 or 5 things that went a bit our way this quarter. 
David Togut: Understood. And then could you update us on the growth rate in the large fleet market? You had the big sales force expansion there with Comdata post that acquisition, been running up, I think, double digits previous quarters. What were you seeing in Q2? 
Ronald F. Clarke: When you say the large -- clarify the question though, when you say the large. 
David Togut: Well, looking at the acquired fleet business from Comdata where you had the big sales force headcount expansion, and you got that up to double digits in previous quarters, I'm just wondering what the growth rate was in Q2 revenue-wise. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Let me look at -- I've got the sales number, I think, handy here. Hold on 1 second. I don't have the revenue number, but I do have the sales number handy. Sales were up about 20% combined for the old Comdata business -- fleet business over the prior year. That's up 100% basically over 2 years ago when we started the expansion of people. So that productivity is obviously getting healthy now and obviously way up from when we bought the thing. 
David Togut: Got it. Quick final question from me. You mentioned an internal and external investigation that you launched a few months ago. What's the update in terms of any findings by both the internal and external teams? 
Eric R. Dey: David, this is Eric. I guess, just to kind of summarize. As we've said before, we believe we're on very solid ground and that all of our fees and billing practices are compliant with all the laws and regulations. To answer your question a little bit, we have completed the legal review. But unfortunately, in light of the recent securities lawsuits, we've been advised that we really can't comment on those reviews. 
Ronald F. Clarke: But we have completed them, David. They are complete. And I think we reiterate what we said before that our view, management view is we are in compliance with every law that regulates our business. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. 
Ashish Sabadra: Just maybe a quick follow-up on the IT issues in the portfolio. So is there a way to quantify how much the impact was from that or what the growth would have been excluding that hiccup? 
Ronald F. Clarke: 2% to 3%, Ashish, in Q2. 
Ashish Sabadra: Okay, that's great. So that would imply that the growth would have been more like 11% to 12% organic excluding the impact of that portfolio? 
Ronald F. Clarke: You got it. 
Eric R. Dey: I think it would have been around 11%, Ashish. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. And the fuel card would have been 11% instead of 8%. So when we gave you 10% for calendar '17, we didn't expect to have an IT divot in the start of the second quarter so... 
Ashish Sabadra: Okay, that color is definitely very helpful. And just plans for SVS now that -- yes, what do you plan to do with SVS? Do you plan to keep that around? Or is there other optionality on that business? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean, it's been a long saga for you guys as well. So I'd say that we obviously considered some other alternatives, right, prior to entering into the deal with First Data. And b, we've gotten a bit smarter. We've now owned it, whatever, 2-plus years. So we're going to go back -- the guy running that is a very good guy. We're going to go back basically and dust off some of the other options and dust off his 3-year growth plan, which we reviewed a bit ago and come back to you guys probably next call with some clear review of what we're going to do. 
Ashish Sabadra: That's helpful as well. And just on the corporate payment side. You talked about some of the sales, which were -- the solid traction that you've had, you'll start to see conversions into revenues going forward, which is actually growth. But just in terms of -- I was wondering if you could give any more incremental color in terms of how's the pipeline looking for growth going forward in terms of new implementations and increasing market share with your existing client base. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean, the business is performing great. Sales in that line, the business were up 35% in the quarter. I think we told you they were up 50% the prior year over the first year. So the sales are good. And that conversion time is about 12 to 18 months, so it's relatively easy for us to plan what the second half and next year is going to look like as we fundamentally have sold virtually all the business as of today that will hit revenue in the second half and in '18. And so again, that business is trending, I think, 14% -- 13%, 14%, 15% this quarter. It will step up a bit. So it's great. And then, obviously, on top of that, we have the Cambridge thing that we expect to close this month, and that gives us some great cross-sell opportunities, some ripe accounts to deliver those same domestic AP products in this. So we've grown to like that business a lot. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Danyal Hussain with Morgan Stanley. 
Danyal Hussain: On the IT conversion, it sounded like attrition deteriorated over the course of the second quarter and it's stabilized by this point but just mathematically I guess the impact to the third quarter and to the back half would be greater than that 2% to 3% you called out? Could you just -- do you have an estimate for what that impact will be in the back half and what you're baking into the 8% to 9% organic number you gave? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, that's a good question. I'd say it's probably in our forecast 1 point more because we didn't pick up the loss rate really until sometime in Q2. So obviously, the exit rate in June was a bit higher than the average for the quarter. So I'd say it's probably in our forecast another point of divot in 3 and 4. 
Danyal Hussain: Okay, perfect. And then just on, I guess, the rest of that portfolio, it sounds like you've only done part of the conversion. Is there more that's in the plan for this year? Are you going to hold off? What's your confidence that the rest of it should go through smoothly? 
Ronald F. Clarke: That's a rhetorical question, but the answer is yes. We're kind of taking a pause. I mean, I make the joke -- I don't know if you're a sports guy, but you can never bat 1,000 or make 80% 3 pointers or whatever. And I guess, in IT conversion, you can't bat 1,000 either. And so we've had a lot of success. I tried to call out some to give some credit to our IT people, but this one obviously did not go great. So we are doing the postmortem and making sure that this never happens again. So we'll stage it different. We'll have different people reviewing it. So I'd say that we're going to be super duper sure the next time. So it probably won't be any time this year. 
Danyal Hussain: Got it, perfect. And just a quick one just on cash taxes. Eric, it looked like they picked up this quarter. Could you just talk about how you expect cash taxes to look going forward versus GAAP? 
Eric R. Dey: We -- I think what I guided to is 29.5% for the balance of the year. As I stated in my script, there's a lot of moving parts with the change in the accounting convention for stock-based compensation. It can actually move the number around a little bit. If you recall, we had a 26% tax rate in Q1. It was because we had more than anticipated shares that were exercised in the quarter. And then in the second quarter, we had fewer than we'd anticipated, which caused the tax rate to go up a little bit. But I would say in the back half of the year, we're still anticipating around a 29.5% tax rate. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. 
Robert Napoli: That STP business, Ron, I think your goal was to get that revenue growth rate up to 20%. You had a -- you're in the low teens, but the transaction growth is nominal. You're getting very good revenue per transaction. What is the strategy? Do you still think 20% is a reasonable place to get that? And what is the game plan from the mix of transactions? I know that business was mispriced and you have a pretty broad game plan with that business. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. So I'd say, Bob, the goal is still -- in fact, in our forecast, it's either high teens or actually hitting 20% as we exit. So to your point, we're resegmenting the higher-value people and then we've got some different sales channels that will also bring in some higher-value people. And then we've got a longer-range plan, where some of those new toll roads are expected to come online. And so the business is fighting. Just a general malaise in the economy and particularly in the trucking sector, which is a big part of the transaction, so that's one of the places the same-store sales are still quite soft, which is bringing the trend count down. But again, we don't -- today, the company doesn't get paid very much from that group. So it's not as big an impact on revenue. But I'd say that we're well along on a bunch of these plans, the repricing plans, the new sales channel, the IT stuff to enable some of it. The toll road thing is legislated. So I'd say our confidence is still quite high that, that's a close to 20% business in the midterm. 
Robert Napoli: Okay. And then just on the fuel card business. I mean, your competitor has had some issues with fraud that they seem to be pretty confident as an industry. Wide issue with fraudsters going after the gas pumps because they -- there hasn't been a non-EMV compliant and -- but it doesn't seem like you're seeing any of that at all in your business? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Our -- we keep track of both credit losses in total and fraud as a piece of our credit losses. And fraud has declined '16 over '15 and this year year-to-date versus the prior year. So our fraud is down. But we've gone crazy, Bob, in terms of what we call drag, net authorization controls basically to find, identify and shut off fraudulent stuff because we had our own share of problems 4 and 5 years ago. So I'd say that we've worked that pretty hard. And year-to-date, I think our total fraud losses are in the $4 million or $5 million range. So it's pretty low. 
Eric R. Dey: It's about $2.5 million year-to-date. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Year-to-date. Annualized, call it $5 million. It's not a big issue for us. 
Robert Napoli: Not seeing it. So I guess, it was good to have problems a few years ago. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. We work on so many things, but that's one we've worked on, yes. 
Robert Napoli: And then last question, and I'd turn it over. I mean, great job on -- I really appreciate laying out the changes in the EPS guidance. So just the changes in the revenue guidance from keeping SVS, selling Nextraq and buying Cambridge, what was the net effect on revenue -- the revenue guidance? 
Eric R. Dey: I've got to go back and look at that, Bob. Sorry. I have to get back to you on that. I just don't have it handy. I'd have to add it up. 
Ronald F. Clarke: I have it here in front of me. It's kind of $5 million to $10 million favorable in the second half. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Just wanted to -- I guess, I want to come -- keep coming back to this -- the soft spot you guys called out. I just want to make sure the second half organic growth rate, if we were to strip those 2 issues out, it would be closer to 11% to 13% for the second half run rate of organic growth, 11% to 13%? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. We gave 10%, Tien-tsin, right in guidance. We did, I think, 10% in the first quarter. We reported 9%. I think I said 8% to 9% in Q3 and 4 and that, for the question earlier, had call it 2 to 3 points this quarter and maybe 3 to 4 in the next quarter. So it would have been, call it, 11-ish, fuel price being 50% of the business, call it 11%. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Got it. Okay, yes, so you wouldn't have the acceleration if it were not for that. So just I know -- I get there's no quick fix. It's happened, you said it plateaued, but it sounds like you want to get that back up. Is there a plan in place? Are you going to put more sales up or try and get that portfolio back up? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean, obviously, it's a great product when you don't scoop up the history on clients. So the product is a good product, which we've obviously sold a lot of until the thing had good satisfaction. So yes, we just -- we want to really make sure all is good, like everything is good. I want to see a little bit more of the tail here before we redirect a bunch of resources back at it. So I'd say we're still a little bit in pause, maybe another month or 2. I want to see a little bit more data. But it's clearly our best U.S. fuel card product, so we will be back selling it. The question is just is it 1 month or 2 or 3 from now. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Okay. Just as my final question just thinking about new sales, it sounds like retention has been stable. But -- so your expectation given what you've heard -- we learned today around new sales for the year and then retention for the year, not just 2Q, has that changed, Ron? 
Ronald F. Clarke: I think in our forecast, we reported 7% global sales growth over the prior year. I would say 10% to 12% would be the number if we hadn't gotten distracted, right, calling customers back, this thing. So I would assume that, that will rebound, will be double-digit growth of sales in the second half. And we haven't done all the math yet. There'll be some flow-through from this onetime attrition, so 1 portfolio, which I think, Eric, was 3% to 4% of the global company was the file we converted. So anyway, whatever that onetime loss is, we'll see some of that trickle into Q3 and Q4, that 91.5%. But again, that's in our -- kind of in the numbers, which -- I don't want to make this a depressing call talking about IT. But just to remind everybody, it clearly suggests rest of world, rest of FLEETCOR is doing good to be able to continue to kind of beat what we set out and beat the profit number. That means kind of all things we didn't convert are doing well. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of James Schneider with Goldman Sachs. 
James Schneider: I was wondering if you could maybe say a little bit more about the European partner opportunities you touched on, on the call earlier, Ron. Do you -- what's your confidence interval that one or both of those opportunities will convert before year-end and how do you like your chances? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Jim, always -- I've been wrong enough on this. It's hard to handicap again. But the update I try to provide is that the time line to a decision that gets reported back to us has narrowed considerably. So we expect in both cases to hear something imminently. And then I'd say, like always, we're optimists that we like our chances. So we continue to tell you that we're in the hunt for things. There are people looking at them, people studying them and people telling us they're going to decide. And so we're kind of reporting back that we expect to hear something soon. 
James Schneider: That's helpful. And then I apologize if I missed this before. But obviously, same-store sales started to improve a little bit, and that's a good thing. Do you feel like those markets, especially transport energy and the like, are in a position where they can actually continue to improve from here? Or do you feel that's just too tough a call based on what you see today? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I think that the visibility we have is limited, right? We would have called out that we see the thing turning. What I would say is there's a few industries that are clear, right? We've grown over the oil and gas thing, same thing on the transport, lodging business, the railroad thing, we're on the other side of that. It looks like, again, the Brazil thing is stable to move a bit. So I'd say that it feels like a few of the pieces that were on the wrong side of this thing have moved to the correct side. But with as many different places and things we're in, I can't say that we have a great forward view of it. We kind of planned it flat is kind of what's in our forecast for the second half. 
Operator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments. 
Eric R. Dey: I want to thank everybody for participating in the call today, and we look forward to further dialogue. Thank you very much. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.

===== 2017 Q1  (2017-05-01 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the FleetCor Technologies, Inc. First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. 
 I would like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Eric Dey, Chief Financial Officer, of FleetCor Technologies. Thank you, Mr. Dey. You may begin. 
Eric R. Dey: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. By now, everyone should have access to our first quarter press release. It can be found at www.fleetcor.com under the Investor Relations section. Throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than other companies similarly titled non-GAAP information. Quantitative reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appear in today's press release and on our website as previously described. Also, we are providing 2017 guidance on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis. 
 Finally, before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements. This includes forward-looking statements about our 2017 guidance, new product and fee initiatives and expectations regarding business development and acquisitions. They are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore, you should not put undue reliance on them. These results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K and in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the Security and Exchange Commission. Others are described in our annual report on Form 10-K. These documents are available on our website, as previously discussed, at www.sec.gov. 
 With that out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay, Eric. Thanks. Hi, everyone. I appreciate your joining the call today on short notice. Upfront here, I plan to cover 3 subjects. First, I'll comment on our Q1 results and rest of year outlook. Second, I hope to set the record straight on questions regarding our fees, our billing practices and our customer service. And then lastly, I'll discuss the Cambridge acquisition announcement, along with the rationale for the deal. Okay, so on to the quarter. We reported a good Q1. Revenue was ahead of our internal expectations by a few million and cash EPS exceeded the high end of our guidance range. We reported revenue of $520 million, up 26% and cash EPS of $1.96, up 28%. No big macro story. The macro environment was effectively neutral in Q1 versus the prior year, and it was really right in line with our 2017 expectations. Very importantly, our organic revenue growth accelerated to 10% in Q1. That includes our global fuel card line of business, which also grew 10% in the quarter. And as a reminder, that accounts for about half the revenue in the company. New sales were good. They grew 12% in the quarter versus last year. So in terms of growth, what drove growth in Q1, really 3 things. First, the addition of STP, which we did not own last year. STP continues to perform really on plan, grew 12% in constant currency in the quarter. 
 A second driver was double-digit growth in almost every product line. I mentioned fuel cards are 10%, our Corporate Payments are 13%, tolls are 12%, hotels are 15%. And then lastly, last driver, we enjoyed a 3% lower tax rate in the quarter versus plan. Eric will provide a bit more detail on the reason. This also added to our beat. So look, all in all, really good start to the year. So in terms of rest of the year outlook, we are staying put with our initial 2017 guidance. The macro seems to be right where we called it, and we expect the tax rate to flow back to a more normalized level of 29.5% for the rest of the year. So with those assumptions, we'll flow-through the $0.11 beat to our Q1 guidance, raise our full year 2017 cash EPS estimate at the midpoint to $8.31, which will represent a 20% increase over 2016's reported $6.92. Okay, let me shift gears and weigh in on the various questions that we have been getting regarding customer fees, billing practices and our customer service. I mean, upfront here, our opinion is that these research reports are fake news and exaggerations. There is obviously not enough time today to deal with all of the inaccuracies. So I'll cover just a few here. So start with customers and customer value. Look, you have to provide value and benefits to customers. That's why customers use our products. In the case of fuel cards, value is really in 4 areas. One, hard savings, the actual rebates or discounts the customers get from retail prices; two, purchase controls that limit on authorized purchases; three, convenience, an easy way for the employees to make purchases on the company's behalf; and then, last is reporting an automated record-keeping in exception reporting system. So those are the 4 benefit areas for fuel cards. 
 Last year, in 2016, our customers got hard savings that is discounts or rebates from the retail prices of their transactions that approximated $1 billion, $1 billion. So that's more than the total of all the customer revenue in every business we have combined. So we provide plenty of hard savings to customers. So do we get customer complaints? Yes,  of course, we do. We serve 700,000 active customers that are build on average 30x per year, but our registered complaint levels relative to the size of our client base is lower than a lot of our B2B card issuer peer group. We believe our customers are getting value and getting benefits with us. The most direct proof is customer retention, which runs over 90%. And our small clients can leave our service at any time. There is no minimum contract period. So we think we provide lots of customer value. Okay, size of fees, these miscellaneous fees. So let's address the size of our so-called miscellaneous fees. So in 2016, the total of the "miscellaneous fees" was about $100 million, I call it 6% of revenue, and of that, about 75% is concentrated in just 2 fee types, minimum program fees and high-risk credit fees. The balance of our customer revenue is in 5 big businesses. Those would be STP, SVS, telematics, CLC and Comdata trucking. So the fees in those 5 businesses are quite simple and quite straightforward. So a couple of examples. In STP, customers pay somewhere between $5 and $7 a month to get an electronic toll sticker that allows them to go nonstop through all the tolls in Brazil, an average of 14x. In SVS, where the clients are large retailers, they pay for the creation and processing of their branded gift cards under long-term contracts. So in these 5 businesses, they are close to 0 miscellaneous fees. 
 Okay, let me talk a little bit of late fees. The question we're getting is, do we make customers pay late? Do we, FleetCor, make customers pay late? So, no. First off, sizing of late fees total about $100 million last year. We carry receivables balance and AR balance of about $2 billion. We lose $50 million annually in credit losses and fraud, clients that don't pay us. We spend over $15 million to finance receivables. So that the size of our late fee revenue $100 million seems quite proportionate to us. Also, most customers pay on time every cycle. In fact, over 85% do can pay on time. Over 50% of all of our U.S. customers pay electronically, and the balance pay via either a PNC or region's lockbox where checks are posted 2x daily. So maybe clear, paper checks never come to FleetCor, never come to FleetCor. Look, our policy is straightforward. We comply with all the laws that regulate our business, all of them. And we are in the business of satisfying clients or we wouldn't have any. We are also not perfect. We make mistakes, we get customer complaints. But look, in the aggregate, across all the clients and all the transactions and all the statements, we do a terrific job. We provide lots of value, lots of hard savings, we got lots of satisfied clients and we retained 90% of the clients every year. So pretty positive. 
 Okay, let me leave that and shift gears here and go over to the Cambridge transaction, which we announced a bit earlier. So we -- at the outset here, I want you to know that we posted a brief PowerPoint on Cambridge on our website which you might find helpful. So we have signed definitive documents to acquire Cambridge for approximately CAD 900 million or USD 675 million. We expect that deal will add about $0.05 of incremental cash EPS this year. That's assuming a Q3 close. And then post the deal, we're looking at leverage being roughly 2.9x. So under our 3x target. 
 In terms of the description who is Cambridge. In a nutshell, they are an international cross-border payments company that processes roughly $20 billion in B2B cross-border payments. They serve about 13,000 small and midsized clients and they make international AP payments to both suppliers and employees, and they do that in 140 currencies, 140 currencies. We estimate Cambridge's 2017 revenue at about $125 million. Their revenue has grown impressively 24% compounded over the last 5 years. 
 In terms of the business model, I'd say it's quite FleetCor-like: recurring revenue, limited CapEx, limited working capital, even high barriers to entry. You need money transmitter licenses to participate in this space and obviously, need a global banking disbursement network, which is quite difficult to replicate. So why the deal, what's the rationale for FleetCor to look at a cross-border B2B company? So first, we like the market. It's big, big opportunity. It's estimated to be $145 billion opportunity, which is larger than the domestic AP market that our Comdata Corporate Payments business is in. It's also served almost exclusively by banks. So we like the opportunity to compete. Second, we think the growth prospects in Cambridge's case are great. They've doubled revenues over the last 4 years. And we think, given the large market size, their sales investments and their technology advantage, that they can double revenue again. And third rationale is really the synergies with the Comdata, our Corporate Payments business. The customer type, size of customers are almost identical to Comdata. But on the Cambridge side, they enable international AP and Comdata enables domestic AP. So clearly, all of the Cambridge clients have to pay domestic AP. So we think there is a pretty big revenue opportunity to capture, if we can offer up Comdata's virtual card solutions into the Cambridge client base. 
 Look, we like the deal, we like the transaction. It's a terrific company, targeting a large market and served almost exclusively by banks, with a very similar customer target as Comdata. It is the third largest deal that we've done in FleetCor history. So we invested lots of time here on the thesis and are quite confident that we can double Cambridge earnings over the next 3 to 4 years. So, look, in closing, before I turn it over to Eric, I must say that we're quite disheartened that some outsiders have questioned our commitment to customers -- to our customers. I mean, customers are the only reason that you have a business. So we are reconfirming our policy and commitment to act in only the utmost compliance with the laws that regulate our business. We're going to keep moving forward. We're going to move forward hard. We're going to win new accounts. We're going to double down the third of the accounts that we have, and we're proud here of the way that we compete and the way that we play. So don't bet against us. 
 So with that, let me turn the call back over to Eric. He'll provide some additional details on the quarter. Eric? 
Eric R. Dey: Thank you, Ron. For the first quarter of 2017, we reported revenue of $520.4 million, up 26% compared to $414.3 million in the first quarter of 2016.
 The revenue from our North America segment increased 8.7% to $329.9 million from $303.5 million in the first quarter of 2016. Revenue from our International segment increased 72.1% to $190.5 million from $110.7 million in the first quarter of 2016.
 For the first quarter of 2017, GAAP net income increased to 11.3% to $123.7 million or $1.31 per diluted share from $111 million or $1.17 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2016. The other financial metrics that we routinely use, our adjusted revenues and adjusted net income, which we sometimes also refer to as cash net income or cash EPS. 
 Adjusted revenues equal our GAAP revenues less merchant commissions. We use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate the company's revenues, net of the commissions that are paid to merchants who participate in certain card programs. We compute adjusted net income to eliminate the effects of noncash or nonrecurring items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance. A reconciliation of adjusted revenues and adjusted net income to GAAP numbers are provided in Exhibit 1 of our press release. Adjusted revenues in the first quarter of 2017 were $496 million, up 29% compared to $386 million in the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted net income for the first quarter of 2017 increased 27% to $185 million or $1.96 per diluted share compared to $145.7 million or $1.53 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2016. 
 First quarter results reflect the impact of the macroeconomic environment. When we talk about the macroeconomic environment, we are referring to the impact that market fuel spread margins, fuel prices and foreign exchange rates have on our business. Changes in foreign exchange rates from the first quarter of 2017 were primarily negative, and overall, we believe negatively impacted revenue during the quarter by approximately $5 million. 
 Fuel prices were mostly favorable during the quarter. And although we can now precisely calculate the impact of these changes, we believe they positively impacted revenues by approximately $10 million. And finally, spreads were mixed and, we believe, unfavorably impacted our results by approximately $7 million. So in total, the impact of these changes had a nominal negative impact on our first quarter revenues of approximately $2 million and adjusted net income per diluted share of approximately $0.01. Organic growth was approximately 12% for the first quarter of 2017 or 10%, when excluding the impact of the macroeconomic environment. We have additional financial disclosure this quarter, consistent with reporting of our 2016 year-end results, which can be found in our earnings release. We have added organic revenue growth in the revenue by product category. So now you can see not only the revenue per transaction for each of our major products, but you can also see organic growth for each major product category on a pro forma and macro-neutral basis. We have also included additional disclosures around our major sources of revenue. In major sources of revenue from customers, we are including processing and program revenue, late fees and finance charge revenue and miscellaneous fee revenue. 
 Included in processing and program fee revenue, our revenues from customers based on accounts, cards, devices, transactions, load amounts and/or purchase amounts, et cetera, for participation in our various fleet and workforce-related programs as well as revenue from partners, such as major retailers, leasing companies, oil companies, petroleum marketers or processing and network management services. These revenues primarily represent revenue from North America Trucking, lodging, prepaid benefits, telematics, gift cards and toll-related businesses. Miscellaneous fees include nonstandard fees from customers based on customer behavior or optional participation, primarily including high-risk credit surcharges, overcredit limit surcharges, minimum processing fees, printing and mailing fees, environmental fees, et cetera. 
 Miscellaneous customer fees accounted for approximately 6% of total revenue in the first quarter of 2017. Now let's shift over and discuss other drivers of our first quarter performance. For our North American segment, most of our lines of business performed well, resulting in approximately a 10% organic growth rate in the quarter on a constant fuel price and spread basis. Some of the positive drivers in North America during the quarter included our MasterCard fuel card, which had organic revenue growth of approximately 23% over the first quarter of 2016. Our CLC business was up 15%, partner business was up 16%, Corporate Payments up 13%, just to name a few. 
 International segment organic revenue was also up approximately 10% on a constant macro basis in the first quarter of 2017 versus the first quarter of 2016. Similarly, our number of businesses performed well in the quarter, including the Shell Europe business, with revenue up mid-teens. Our Russia business has started to rebound and was up 18% in the quarter. Our Mexico business was up 23% and our Travelcard and STP businesses were up in the low teens organically. So a pretty good quarter in the International segment. 
 Now moving down to the income statement. Total operating expenses for the first quarter were $325.4 million compared to $238.3 million in the first quarter of 2016, an increase of 36.6%. As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses increased to 62.5% of revenue compared to 57.5% in the first quarter of 2016. Included in operating expenses, our merchant commissions, processing expenses, bad debt, selling and general administrative expense, depreciation and amortization expense and other operating net. Included in the first quarter of 2017 operating expense were ongoing expenses related to the acquisitions closed in 2016. Also stock-based compensation expense in the first quarter of 2017 was $24.6 million compared to $15.9 million in the first quarter of 2016. Deal-related expenses were approximately $1.5 million in the first quarter of 2017 versus approximately it's $500,000 in the first quarter of 2016. Credit losses were $13 million for the first quarter or 8 basis points compared to $6.8 million or 5 basis points in the first quarter of 2016. The increase in bad debt was primarily due to bad debt inherent in the acquired STP business, the addition of new euroShell locations and normal quarterly fluctuations of certain businesses. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 79% to $64.9 million in the first quarter of 2017 from $36.3 million in the first quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to the STP acquisition. Interest expense increased 43% to $23.1 million compared to $16.2 million in the first quarter of 2016. The increase in interest expense was due primarily to the impact of additional borrowings for the STP and Travelcard acquisitions and increases in LIBOR. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2017 was 26.1% compared to 29.2% for the first quarter of 2016. The reduction in the tax rate was primarily due to excess tax benefits on share-based compensation in the first quarter of 2017 versus the first quarter of 2016 and the favorable mix shift impact of higher international earnings in the first quarter of 2017 versus the first quarter of 2016. We reported $1.96 in adjusted net income per diluted share, up 28% compared to $1.53 in the first quarter of 2016. 
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $735 million in total cash, $188 million is restricted and consists of primarily customer deposits. As of March 31, we had $2.4 billion outstanding on our term A loan, $244 million outstanding on our term B loan and $569 million drawn on our revolver, leaving $467 million of undrawn availability. We had $676 million borrowed in our securitization facility at the end of the quarter. As of March 31, 2017, our leverage ratio was 2.80x EBITDA, which is below our covenant level of 3.75x EBITDA as calculated under our credit agreement. We intend to use our future excess cash flow to temporarily pay down the balance on our revolving credit facility and securitization facility, and maintain liquidity for acquisitions and other corporate purposes. 
 Finally, we are not a capital-intensive business, spending $15 million on CapEx during the first quarter of 2017. Now on to our outlook for the remainder of 2017. First, I want to update you on our latest thinking about the macroeconomic environment for the balance of the year. The good news is that, in total, the macro came in mostly where we thought it would be. The current trend is for fuel price and spread to continue to be at our prior guidance level for the balance of the year. And although foreign exchange rates are trending favorably to our prior guidance, we believe it is too early to make a change to our full-year guidance as a result of such a short-term trend. So in summary, we are leaving our macro guidance assumptions unchanged for the balance of the year. Our financial guidance is as follows: total revenues to be between $2,175,000,000 and $2,235,000,000; GAAP net income between $553 million and $573 million; GAAP net income per diluted share to be between $5.83 and $6.03. Adjusted net income to be between $780 million and $800 million; and adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $8.21 and $8.41. This guidance represents approximately a 20% growth in revenue and 20% growth in adjusted net income per diluted share for the year at the midpoint of the range. Some of the assumptions we have made in preparing this guidance include the following: weighted fuel prices equal to $2.43 per gallon average for 2017 in the U.S. compared to $2.15 per gallon average in the U.S. in 2016, up approximately 13%. This represents no change from our prior guidance. Market spreads returning closer to historical levels, up slightly from the 2016 average. This represents no change from our prior guidance as well. Foreign exchange rates equal to the 7-day average ended January 22, 2017. Although foreign exchange rates are trending favorably since the end of the first quarter, we need to see a longer trend before we update our full year guidance. SVS business is retained for 2017, and we will provide an update when the transaction closes. Interest expense of $100 million compared to $72 million in 2016. Again, no change from prior guidance. Fully diluted shares outstanding of 95 million shares. We are assuming a 29.5% per quarter tax rate for the rest of the year, which is consistent with prior guidance. The result is a full year tax rate of approximately 28.8% versus the prior guidance of 29.5% in total. No impact related to the closing of the Cambridge Global Payments acquisition. We will reflect in guidance once the acquisition is closed. Included on the company's website, as Ron mentioned earlier, is a presentation describing the Cambridge deal, which we plan to cover on today's earnings call. And no impact related to acquisitions or material new partnership agreements not already disclosed. 
 And finally, for the second quarter, we are expecting adjusted net income per diluted share to be approximately the same as the first quarter. The second quarter assumes improving revenue and operating performance versus the first quarter, offset by the expected higher tax rate, which is in line with our prior guidance. As a reminder, the company's volumes built throughout the year and new asset initiatives gained momentum throughout the year, resulting in a much higher earnings per share in the third and fourth quarters. With that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ramsey El-Assal of Jefferies. 
Ramsey El-Assal: I think, I may know the answer to this question, but I feel like I need to ask anyway. With all of the recent scrutiny with the fee and billing practices, has it had any impact on your go-forward ability to implement pricing actions or change of practices, or is it just business as usual? 
Todd House: Ramsey, it's Todd House here. I'd say, no. We've really seen no impact on our day-to-day business. Our interaction with our SMB clients. We've had a couple of our largest clients in the enterprise segment asked some questions, but it's been easily talked off. And I'd say, our partners, the branded partners BP and Chevron have also asked some questions, but in general, it's been quite easy to work with them. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. So my next question, which I think your answer was no competitive impact as well? 
Todd House: .
 That's correct. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. Could you elaborate a little bit on the Cambridge acquisition. How quickly can you implement the cross-sell opportunity there in terms of integrating the 2 organizations? Is it something where it's going to be a lengthy integration? Or is it something that's going to happen relatively quickly? 
John Coughlin: Hey Rams, it's John. I think -- we think of it as a really a cross-sell opportunity. So probably to reach full potential would be a couple of years out. But clearly, near term, for all new sales, that'll be selling both solutions. But when you think about the go-to-market, Cambridge has about 170 people, Comdata has about 100 people. So now instead of having 100 people or so at Comdata, we got 270. Instead of having 170 or so at Cambridge, we've got 270. So I think it will be powerful as it hits the market. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Ramsey, it's Ron. I mean, immediately, we are going to take some specialists in cards business from our business and put them into Cambridge so that we can go to their clients like Day 5 and start pitching the domestic AP solution. So we're not going to wait long to get at pitching our stuff to Cambridge. But to John's point, a fuller integration will take a bit longer. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Got it. And then on the lodging business, obviously, growth bouncing up pretty nicely there, understanding there are some easy comps, but are you seeing incremental health in some of your core verticals within that business, rail, energy, those types of clients? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, it's good -- it's Ron, again. It's good to have the excuse train over. That stuff canceled out, Ramsey, flat finally for the quarter. So to your point, there was no [indiscernible] problem. In sales, we are at a record level. So it's healthy sales and no [ divit ] from the base. 
Operator: The next question is from David Togut of Evercore. 
David Togut: Good to see the acceleration in organic revenue growth. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Thanks, David. 
David Togut: Just digging in, did you provide same-store sales for FleetCor overall in the quarter? 
Ronald F. Clarke: 1.5% negative. 
David Togut: Okay. That's about the same level as we saw in the fourth quarter? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I think it was a -- it's a shade higher. Shade point, David... 
John Coughlin: Shade higher. 
Ronald F. Clarke: In Q4 in Brazil. I mean, the call-out I give you in that average is Brazil is still not great, let's call it 5% to 7% in Brazil. 
David Togut: Got it. Okay. And then, so WEX called out an increase in credit losses to 17 basis points in the first quarter, yours are significantly lower at 8 basis points. I would appreciate your insights on kind of why the big difference and where do you see credit losses going? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, don't know, we don't follow their losses, but we've had no increase in either skimming or fraud or just losses generally. So I'd say that our forecast, which we looked at a couple of weeks ago, is kind of same old, same old. So we are not seeing it. 
David Togut: Got it. And then just shifting gears, revenue per transaction in the fuel card business did decline slightly by about 3% in the quarter. What were the main drivers behind that? 
Eric R. Dey: David, this is Eric. One is the addition of the Travelcard acquisition that has a lower revenue per transaction in the line average. So a little bit of mix going on in there as well. But if you look at the page that we provide and you look at them, you look at revenue per tran on a macro adjusted basis, it's actually up a little bit. So a, macro adjusted, it's up a little bit; and then b, the mix impact of Travelcard cause it to go down if you look at on a nonmacro-adjusted basis as well. 
David Togut: Got it. And then just a quick final question from me. Can you give us an update on organic growth at Allstar and how far are you through the conversion with Visa to chip card from mag-stripe in the U.K.? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, David, it's Ron. So it's a two-part question. Let me take the second, first. So virtually done, I think, other than a couple of partners, all of the accounts that we control directly are now on the combined card. And I think we've got one partner left to move across. So that's good. And I'd say we are in the testing mode now of kind of opening that card up. So to kind of nonfuel spend the same program, I think I mentioned that we are on here in the U.S. So we are in a good place platform-wise that the whole book is over, and we're now trying to get smart on the segments and what offers we make to the clients that we've got. 
David Togut: And is growth picking up in that business from mid-single digits in Q4? 
Ronald F. Clarke: It's not. I don't have it in front of me. It was somewhere without the pound, without the FX and constant currency, it was, I think, probably mid-single digits. And again, the key to that, as I mentioned, is going to be the take rate. The fastest way to accelerate growth there is just nonfuel spend. So stay tuned on it. 
Operator: The next question is from Danyal Hussain of Morgan Stanley. 
Danyal Hussain: Just on organic growth, again, that was a pretty quick recovery from the second half of last year and I think you didn't really have much contribution from Speedway yet. So how did that come in versus expectations and where were you, I guess, most pleasantly surprised? 
Ronald F. Clarke: You want to take that, Eric? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes, I would say first of all from a Speedway perspective, didn't have a big contribution in the quarter. We are going through the integration, as we speak. So we did have some volume, but it was relatively low for the quarter, but it is going to start accelerating as we get into Q2 and then in the second half of the year, in particular. I would say we were -- I'd say pleasantly surprised at a couple of areas. One, I think, fuel cards came in at a pretty solid 10%. There was another very good contribution from MasterCard, and then the gift card business also came in very strong due to some card orders that came in in the first quarter. So those were kind of the 2 areas that I would call out. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I'd add Corporate Payments. Corporate Payments was a few million ahead of our plan. 
Danyal Hussain: Okay, great. And then I just wanted to ask about this internal review that I think had been referred to. Could you just talk a little bit about the scope of what we've covered and maybe some of the conclusions that you reached? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I would say, Danyal, we're in process. So we are running through an internal review of materials and websites and practices and how those various things compared to "market." So I'd say that that's kind of in process. And then two, we've retained someone kind of independently to also review same set of things so that I could get kind of 2 sets of feedback. So I'd say we're probably 1/2 to 2/3 of the way through both of those. 
Danyal Hussain: Okay. Are there any costs that we should be cognizant of for the second quarter? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Costs, did you say? 
Danyal Hussain: Yes, just, as it relates to this review. 
Eric R. Dey: No, it's not that material. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Immaterial. 
Operator: Our next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: When you guys talk about synergies for Cambridge, are those revenues are -- are they also expense synergies? 
Ronald F. Clarke: It is Ron, again. I'd say predominantly revenue. If you look at the cost structure of that company, it's pretty weighted in sales and service, so the "G&A technology" piece is smaller generally. So most of the upside that we're looking at is revenue. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Got it. And then we think about this specific deal and obviously, it being one of the larger deals that you have done, should we assume that kind of takes you out of the market to do deals first for a period of time? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Not a good assumption. 
John Coughlin: Never count us out. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, again -- like we said around 3 and I think we posted our math is 2.9. So we are going to refi a bit make sure that we have capacity. John gets paid for what he does in the future, so they're working on additional things. So I said it before, if we find something in that pile that we want to close on and it bumps us up short term, then we will do it. And if we don't, we'll wait. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Okay. It seems like it's a pretty active pipeline. 
Ronald F. Clarke: John, you want to comment? 
John Coughlin: Yes, it's always active. I think with 10 guys globally, I think, there is never a period of time when we're working on less than 5 deals actively. So we're always busy looking at things. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Got it. And one final question. When I look at transaction growth in the toll business, it seems pretty weak. Could you just talk about that growth rate relative to kind of what you guys expect going forward? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, again, that is -- it is. I think the volume, if you will, that tran growth is and it's back to this headwind 6%, 7%. People, GDP, employment crush in that geography, in that country, and so I think there -- even the great business that they have was fighting through their economic setup. But again, the -- a, the sales channel stuff that we're putting in and b, these new tolls the country is going to put online. I think those hopefully will create some lift even if the economy stays soft. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Okay. Any timing on that on the new toll roads? 
Ronald F. Clarke: John, any view? 
John Coughlin: I haven't looked at it for a year. But when we look at it based on the government reports, I think they had 10 roads to be built in the next 2 years. But to be honest, I haven't updated that view. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, we'll come back. It's a good question. We'll come back with a view on that. 
Operator: The next question is from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. 
James Schneider: Just coming back on the customer fee and regulatory question, can you maybe just -- I don't think you mentioned any interactions with regulatory authorities like the FTC or CFPB or others? Can you maybe just talk about whether you've had any content from -- contact from those authorities as a result of any of the debate around these topics on customer fees? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Jim, it's Ron. No, no contact. 
James Schneider: That's helpful. And then could you maybe just talk a little bit about the Cambridge platform, and I guess, where do you see the segmentation of where Cambridge stops in terms of smaller businesses and then where the Comdata virtual card business starts? And maybe kind of talk about like what the natural border line is for the size of businesses you plan to service on the B2B side and kind of the specifics of the Cambridge technical platform? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, there is a big overlap. If you think kind of $10 million at the low end and call it $300 million and you run the thing, $10 million to $100 million, $100 million to $300-plus million. The first and most important comment is they literally sit on top of each other. Both the Comdata business and Cambridge business serve accounts in kind of those small, medium and large, neither businesses in what you would think of as big enterprise, corporate, right, the payment of the banks. But inside that kind of small, medium and large, Jim, I'd say, Cambridge skews smaller, because they target businesses that might have a pretty big percent right of international business, international payments. So they are able to kind of serve a bit smaller client than Comdata, which is the domestic AP. But really happy attraction of this thing is the relatedness of the type of customers basically and the fact that, over time, we can integrate the sales force to sell 2 highly related things to the same account. 
James Schneider: Helpful. And then just a quick clarification, I think, your competitor WEX also talked about seeing increased on-time payments of -- by customers. Is that any kind of trend that you've seen in the quarter as well? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Nothing that stands out. We have obviously lots of different portfolios, but I'd say there is nothing in the trend one way or the other that's relatively constant. 
Operator: The next question is from Peter Christiansen of Citi. 
Peter Christiansen: Thanks so much for the discussion on the recent controversy and the added disclosure in the release. I guess, my first question is really on Cambridge. On a pro forma basis, how should we think about your vertical concentration within certain industries? 
John Coughlin: So, as Ron said, it's very similar. This is John talking. So it's calling on Treasurers and CFOs at $10 million to $300 million companies. When you think about what they are doing, they are doing international payments. So who makes international payments? People who have suppliers or employees abroad. So suppliers abroad would be manufacturing, retailers, wholesalers, professional services, actually like the legal vertical is a very big vertical, where they have foreign counsel they're paying to do work for them in their countries. So the -- it actually opens up several really important corporate -- domestic corporate payment verticals. All those 4 I mentioned are key target areas for Comdata and one of the reasons why we like Cambridge so much is that we are probably underrepresented in those verticals relative to the domestic AP market. 
Peter Christiansen: And has pricing been relatively stable? Do you see that expanding, just some sense of what the pricing trends have been in cross-border payments? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, it's Ron. Let me take that one. I'd say that in the -- in kind of the old-fashioned phone trade and payments, I'd say, the thing is kind of inching down some, and I'd say the good news is in the online where this integration into the systems that runs at a higher rate and obviously, the mix is shifting big time that way. So if you look at this company in aggregate over the last 5 years, it's basically flat. Their bps per dollar spend are fundamentally constant for the last 5 years mostly, again, because the mix has moved to online. 
John Coughlin: Yes, I could add to that. So the online business has been growing at 4x the rate of the in-person trade business. So that, as Ron said, is at a higher rate. Another area that's at a higher rate and that's growing very quickly is exotic currencies. So if you look at what banks have done in FX over the past 5 years, a lot of them have gotten rid of their foreign correspondent networks and FX capabilities in smaller, nonmajor currency markets. And as a result, a lot of those people are turning to Cambridge for white label solution, the banks themselves. And if you are trying to send USD 100,000 to Malaysia, you will pay a higher spread to do that because it's an exotic currency. And so they are seeing that part of their business grow much more quickly than the rest. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Let me just add, Peter, because I failed to mention it, as you're talking here, the strategy, I think, for us, which maybe I didn't articulate well, is that we want to just capture more of a company's AP. So if you think about company's total AP, whether it's domestic or international or paid via check or paper today, historically, in the Comdata business, we've grabbed only domestic and we basically try to grab the paper. So we're getting 20%, 30% of a company's AP. We announced another initiative unrelated to Cambridge, where we're going to offer a complete AP, where we'll take it no matter how it's paid, whether there is still some paper to pay, whether it's ACH. So strategically what we want to do is basically be able to carve out a company's AP in its totality, whether it's virtual card, paper or check, whether it's international or domestic, we want the whole thing. And so that's strategically that's where we're trying to head and then to build the distribution system that can basically enable that. 
Peter Christiansen: And I guess, finally, longer term is there a risk here from real-time payments, is that a longer-term threat? 
John Coughlin: I don't think so. When you think about where this company is focused on, it's focused on the SMB sector, and I think that's one of the ways they win. We haven't talked a lot about that. So both Comdata and Cambridge go to market with really a three-pronged value prop. First is just focus. They are actually calling on these small companies, where the banks don't. Two is with differentiated service. They actually have specialists who know what they're talking about as opposed to a guy at the local branch bank who doesn't know anything about international payment. And then three, they have better technology that integrates with them. So the real-time payments is just the pipe, the way something gets paid, but not the consumer interface and how that payment integrates with their workflow. So Cambridge will go and then provide them a solution, "Hey, I got 1,000 invoices, I need to pay globally every month and I don't want to do that manually with 20 people." And so you can do them on the Cambridge system and what pipe it goes through is almost irrelevant to the people. 
Operator: The next question is from Ashish Sabadra of Deutsche Bank. 
Ashish Sabadra: Solid quarter and thanks for that incremental disclosure that was very helpful. I had a much broader question. There seems to be still misperception about the growth profile and the growth opportunity. And can you just talk about how much more penetration on cross-sell opportunity do you still have, because MasterCard grew at a pretty accelerated pace this quarter as well? So if you can just talk about how much of the growth can potentially come from penetration, especially in the U.S. SMB business and then cross-sell opportunity in your core business? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Ashish, it's Ron. I think we've said starting here, which is probably the most penetrated at least for the universal cards. It's through the mid-term, it's as long as we can see in this SMB segment. And then the second thing, I think we've told you is that we are launching a completely refashioned product line for what we call the micro accounts kind of 2 to 5 or 2 to 6 cards, which historically, we've kind of let them jump in the boat, but not chase them. So there are still -- as long as we can see in terms of trying to grow this thing, 10%-plus, plenty of opportunity here. And then as you roll into the next 2 big markets, Brazil, it's literally day 1, just beginning there. And then you roll into Europe, it's all about a better mousetrap with the universal product versus branded private label product. So I'd said it repeatedly, I think, we're going to try to do a better job producing some opportunity map for you guys. But it's not opportunity limited, it's basically sales and marketing limited. We just have to create enough pressure to make the category in our products known to people. 
Ashish Sabadra: That's great. That's very helpful. And then even when you talked about the retention being 90%-plus, when you think about that less than 10% attrition, can you help us understand how much of it may be bankruptcy or business is going out of business? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, that's another really good question. It's probably 1/3 to 40%. The biggest one is really credit of that group, but there are accounts, obviously, that go out of business. So call it 4 in 10 accounts, we believe, would be what we would call involuntary. 
Operator: The next question is from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. 
Reginald Smith: It's Reggie filling in for Tien-tsin. Just -- I guess, kind of just want to follow up on Ramsey's question from earlier. I think he asked about competition. I'm just curious, with all the headlines, had you received any inbound calls from some of your existing private label partners and if you could share some of the, I guess, color around those conversations? And then, I guess, your most recent updated thinking on kind of the Europe partner pipeline in RFPs and [ all the good ] stuff? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Reggie, it's Ron. So yes, I mean, obviously, big companies, as Todd mentioned, including our partners call and go, "Hey, what is this? What is this stuff here?" So we've obviously tried to provide a few facts and point out the areas of pure fiction to them. So we've done that although it's not helpful, right. I think people allege stuff is not helpful. In terms of the Europe thing, it's kind of same as, I think, we said the last time, which is there are 2 pretty active European RFPs that are still progressing. They are still both saying they are going to make a decision, although as of this call, they haven't. So no more to report other than the couple of things that we're in the hunt for are still active, still alive and hoping they decide something. 
Reginald Smith: Got it. If I could sneak 2 more in. Just thinking about STP, just curious if you guys done any price modernization kind of what's been the early reaction or response from that, if you've done that? And then number 2, I think you talked about a $1 billion in savings that your cardholders get from having the card and kind of explain the value. Can you kind of put that in the context of what annual spend is, just to give us a sense for what that $1 billion is in relation to that? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, the first one is, we don't do price modernization. I'm not familiar with. It doesn't mean much to me. But yes, we studied, I think I told you STP at some length, and determine that the company wasn't particularly segmented. It looked really at the totality of the 4 million or 5 million tag holder, sticker holders that they had and kind of used one-price-fits-all -- one-size-fits-all. So kind of priced everybody, some huge tractor-trailer that goes 65x with a bunch of axles and pays double the toll as Ron, the consumer who uses the thing once in a month to go to his vacation house. So our basic idea is where A, there's more value to some segments than others; B, there's more spend and credit risk with some segments than others. And so the pricing ought to be kind of better align to the value and that which may sound counter to FleetCor, but we're actually offering lower-priced programs that could draw in kind of light users. We think that the product is actually overpriced to attract some kind of convenience people, and then underpriced, if you will, for some of the higher value, higher users. So we have been, I would say, in our lingo kind of restructuring pricing to better match the value that people have got. On your second question, I don't have the matching spend, but I would say it's probably in the 50 bps to 100 bps range, so multiply by 10 or 20. The $1 billion is kind of the spend that's getting some kind of a discount. But the point -- as pointing that out is we wanted to make sure that people know that we have merchant agreements and we literally turn around and give some of that merchant money to clients to a tune of $1 billion. So if someone says that we don't provide any hard savings to people, we want to make sure it was clear that we do, we do actually provide hard savings along with some other benefits. In addition, Reggie, which I didn't say in there, but we also facilitate another couple of billion in discounts that are negotiated between clients and our clients -- vendors and our clients where they do a deal directly, and we basically help administer another couple of billion of discounts as an independent source, which is clearly helpful to our clients as well. 
Reginald Smith: Definitely, that was helpful and a good interesting data point, so we appreciate it. I didn't catch Comdata data growth this quarter, did you guys provide that? 
Ronald F. Clarke: 13%. 
Operator: And our final question is from Darrin Peller of Barclays. 
Darrin Peller: Just quickly on the MasterCard product, I mean most of the questions have been answered. But on the MasterCard side, I know the interchange rates have changed recently. I think you mentioned that was in guidance just to verify that. And then how meaningful is that as well as, I know you also -- I believe, you mentioned on the call renegotiated terms with MasterCard, I believe, if you can comment on that and what that effect would be? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Darrin, hey, it's Ron, again. So yes and yes is the headline answer. So sometime in April, I think, it was around the third week, MasterCard implemented a bit higher interchange in our category. And yes, that -- we have been aware of that and that was built into our '17 plan of guidance. And question 2, yes, we signed a new long-term agreement with them. Was it the middle of last year? 
John Coughlin: July. 
Ronald F. Clarke: In July of last year. That was obviously good for them because it committed us to kind of work with them even though we are obviously working with Visa in Europe, and they were good to us in terms of the terms. So we think it was kind of a win-win. 
Darrin Peller: Okay. All right, that's helpful. And then just quickly, Ron, bigger picture now. I mean this deal with Cambridge. Obviously, we have been waiting for another acquisition at some point soon in the Corporate Payments category makes sense given how strong the virtual payments product you guys have was -- I mean, what is your goal, again, in terms of let's say 3 years from now, 4 years from now to be in terms of percentage from card versus Corporate Payments? Are there other assets down the road? And how long we're going to wait now for the next deal? Just give a little bit more color on the capital allocation plans and really the overall strategy on where you want this business to be in, let's say, 3 years? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, that's again, Darrin, a really good question. So again, I think, in Eric's tables here, we actually were right on 50% fuel card revenue for the quarter, 50% of the $520 million we reported. So with Cambridge, if we had that obviously, we'd be that now into the 40s somewhere, right, if we had the Cambridge thing. So what I would say is that, we invest and work on things that we understand. And so we've had a couple of years to understand the Corporate Payments. And I think with all the questions we get about opportunity, having a category that has massive opportunity like the Corporate Payments and the Cambridge, it's interesting to us now that we understand that the basis on which to compete. So one of the attractions to us is, John and I have looked at other companies in the same category and didn't pull the trigger on them before. Some of the more scale issues, some more mix, some different reasons. But now with this, we might go back and look, again, at some of these companies that we have added before. So I would say that, yes, we like this AP space. It's big. We think nonbanks can be advantaged. We think the game like always is distribution and specialized distribution. So the characteristics of it are, we think quite attractive and it's going to be a larger part. I think I'd be lying to you to say that, "Hey, I know it's going to go from a 15% to 23%," but I would say it's clearly going to be bigger. John got other things when he mentioned the pipeline that are in that set. And so over 3 to 4 years, I would think because the opportunity set in lodging and Corporate Payments and tolls, which we have owned for less times is larger. We will likely keep growing the business more in those segments. Of course, there are still some fuel card things that we're looking at. But I'd say that you should think about the fuel cards being 40% in 2 to 3 years versus call it 47% exiting this year. 
Darrin Peller: All right, that really helps. Really quickly any thoughts about a possible Investor Day at some point in the next year or 2? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, with this particular noise and I do want to say, this is really unhappy for us to have fiction thrown at us and not an easy way to assure people that we do things right and we play the game fair. And so we have chatted over the last couple of weeks about showcasing the business more. So we will be back, Darrin, with something specific on that. We think it's starting to be probably a pretty good idea. 
Operator: Thank you. I'd now like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks. 
Eric R. Dey: I want to thank everybody for joining us today, and we will talk you next quarter. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. 
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.

===== 2016 Q4  (2017-02-08 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the FleetCor Technologies, Inc. Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. 
 I would now turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Eric Dey, Chief Financial Officer of FleetCor Technologies. Thank you, Mr. Dey. You may now begin. 
Eric R. Dey: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 
 By now, everyone should have access to our fourth quarter press release. It can be found at www.fleetcor.com under the Investor Relations section. 
 Throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than other companies' similarly titled non-GAAP information. Quantitative reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today's press release and on our website as previously described. 
 Also, we are providing 2017 guidance on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis with a reconciliation of the 2. 
 Finally, before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements. This includes forward-looking statements about our 2017 guidance, new products and fee initiatives and expectations regarding business development and acquisitions. They are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore, you should not put undue reliance on them. 
 These results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K and in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available on our website, as previously discussed, at www.sec.gov. 
 With that out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay, Eric. Thanks. Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining the call today. Up front here, I'll plan to cover 4 subjects. First, I'll comment on Q4 results. Second, I'll review our full year 2016 results and our progress there. Third, I'll provide our initial 2017 guidance. And then last, I'll update you on our business development activity. 
 Okay. So on to the quarter. We reported a good quarter with Q4 revenue of $515 million, up 20% and cash EPS of $1.90, up 12%. So 20% top, 12% bottom. 
 Our organic revenue growth in the quarter was 8%, in line with our expectations. 
 And not surprisingly, the Q4 macro environment was unfavorable again. During the quarter, fuel prices did finally rise higher than last year, but spreads compressed; FX was challenged. So on a combined basis, the overall macro negatively impacted our revenue in the quarter by about $19 million and our cash EPS by about $0.15 compared to the prior period. 
 So on a constant macro or like-for-like basis, Q4 revenue growth would have been 24% and cash EPS growth, 21%. 
 We had a great Q4 sales performance. Global sales were up 32% versus Q4 last year and up 20% for full year 2016. So very, very healthy sales growth. 
 Some of the drivers of Q4 performance included a full quarter of both the STP and Travelcard acquisitions, with STP revenue growth of 14%. Uber's volume tripled. CLC rebounded, up 15%; Shell Europe revenues were great, up 50%; Mexico, up 15%; and our MasterCard revenue in the U.S. continued strong, up 16%. So lots of good performance is helping the quarter. 
 So look, in summary, we're pleased with Q4 revenue and cash EPS, both finished above the high end of our recent guide, and our new sales bookings recovered quite nicely from Q3. 
 Okay. Let me transition over now to full year 2016. For the year, we reported revenue of $1.831 billion, up 8%, and cash EPS of $6.92, up 10%. 
 2016 was another quite painful macro environmental year for us, negatively impacting our revenues by over $100 million and our cash EPS by about $0.67, so obviously, again, making it difficult to perform. 
 But beyond the numbers, we did continue to make good progress against our build/buy and partner strategy. So on the build front, full year 2016 organic revenue growth, about 8%; full year sales growth, 20%. So we continue to invest and build out our selling systems around the world to support a 10% long-term organic growth target. 
 On the partner front, we did sign Speedway in the spring to a new full outsourcing contract, and we completed the implementation of Shell Europe's program, which was across 11 European markets. Obviously, we are disappointed with Chevron that they've decided to move on after 10 years with us, but we'll help them transition to their new supplier. 
 On the acquisition front, '16, again, quite busy. We acquired STP for $1.3 billion, FleetCor's second largest deal ever. We also completed 3 small tuck-in acquisitions totaling approximately $75 million. 
 And finally, on the positioning front, we advanced a number of things that should accelerate our performance going forward. We added more management depth, 2 new execs on my team: A senior telesales and a senior digital sales executive; a couple new general managers and more IT depth. 
 We renewed in '16 some important contracts, including MasterCard, our health care partners, ECHO and Emdeon, along with some of our largest accepting merchants. We tested a number of new product ideas, a construction card, which is quite successful, expanding Pac Pride acceptance called FleetWide, lending through Kabbage and a set of simpler UIs, all designed to improve our user experience. 
 We converted recently our U.S. MasterCard portfolio to GFN, which is our global processing platform that will aid in simplifying our technology footprint. We did buy back about $180 million of FleetCor stock in '16 at what we think were attractive prices, taking out about 1.3 million shares. And finally, we progressed the STP transformation plan, getting a number of tests in the market that we believe will speed profit growth there in 2017. 
 So all in all, a pretty good 2016. 
 Okay. Let's transition to our 2017 outlook. So for the first time in 3 years, it appears that the environment may actually turn our way and help our financial performance in 2017. I know it's hard to believe. Our 2017 macro assumptions for fuel price, fuel spreads and FX in the aggregate should provide approximately $30 million of incremental revenue lift this year, which will contribute to a very positive setup. 
 Unfortunately, we expect interest rates and the tax compare to be unfavorable this year to the tune of about $0.24 of negative cash EPS headwind. So combined, putting the macro environment with the unfavorable interest and tax expectation, that results in approximately a net $0.12 cash EPS headwind in 2017. But certainly, not as significant as it's been in recent years. 
 So this leads to our -- today to our 2017 guidance at the midpoint of reported revenue of $2.2 billion, up 20% and a cash EPS target of $8.20, up 19%. We also expect to return this year to 10% organic revenue growth. That reacceleration will be driven by a number of things. So first, our Corporate Payments business. It had a record 2016 sales year, so that revenue will get boarded -- more of that will get boarded every quarter, increasing the growth rate there. 
 Speedway, as I mentioned, conversions under way now. New revenue will begin in Q2. That will step up throughout the year. 
 STP, we will layer in new pricing throughout 2017 and step up investment in sales there. We're expecting 20% STP revenue growth. 
 Our overall 2017 global sales plan calls for more investment that should drive sales production up 15% versus 2016. That will add over $300 million of brand-new business. 
 And finally, we have an expectation that a number of our high-growth businesses -- MasterCard, CLC, Mexico -- will continue double-digit growth in 2017. 
 So we're excited to be growing profits again. EBITDA outlook to be up over $200 million, and PBT up over $150 million this year. 
 Okay. Let's shift to the latest on the business development front. So Qui!. Earlier today, we announced a minority investment in Qui!, which is a leading Italian food cart company. This is for sure a plant-the-flag investment. It allows us to wade into Italy, get more familiar with the market, further evaluate the food cart space, and then later decide whether to invest more or commit more to the Italian market. This transaction is consistent with our plan to enter and participate in the world's top 20 markets. 
 Beyond Qui!, we do continue to pursue a couple of new partner outsourcing opportunities and have a pipeline of new acquisition opportunities. With our leverage ratio now back under 3x, we can obviously be aggressive this year in chasing new deals. 
  Okay. In closing, we continue to believe there's still lots of opportunity in front of us, and we believe we can double FleetCor again. So if you think about our core fuel card business, there's still great potential in the U.S. in the micro market, think sub-5 vehicles. Continental Europe is penetrated but exclusively with private-label cards and Brazil, Mexico and Russia are big and still greenfield. 
 So we've built selling systems that can add business in every one of these geographies. Now that we've got more of our fuel cards running on the MasterCard and Visa network, we're exploring opening up our cards selectively to nonfuel spend, things like tolls, construction supplies, et cetera. So we're pretty confident that we can grow our global fuel card business itself 10% long term. 
 Second, Corporate Payments. We've now got 3 or 4 Corporate Payment products, virtual card, hotel cards, toll products, prepaid cards that account for roughly 35% to 40% of our consolidated revenues. And each of these product lines are growing and many are still early in their development. We like these adjacent Corporate Payment products because they share the same business model as fuel cards, which we obviously understand. 
 And then last, business development upside. We continue, albeit slow, to believe in the long-term potential of these major oil companies outsourcing their programs. And we like the expanded acquisition opportunities as we enter some of these new product lines. 
 Our Comdata and STP experience namely that we can improve performance there, even with rather big assets, we think bodes well for the future. 
 And the company's cash flow profile enables this acquisition strategy so that we don't compromise our financial flexibility. So look, we feel very good about FleetCor's prospects to keep on trucking. 
 So with that, let me turn the call back over to Eric. He'll expand more on Q4 and on our 2017 guidance. Eric? 
Eric R. Dey: Thank you, Ron. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we reported revenue of $515 million, up 20% compared to $430.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
 The revenue from our North American segment increased 4.8% to $328.6 million from $313.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
 Revenue from our International segment increased 59.3% to $186.4 million from $117 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.
 For the fourth quarter of 2016, GAAP net income increased 81% to $95.4 million or $1 per diluted share from $52.8 million or $0.56 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2015. Included in GAAP net income in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2015 were noncash impairment charges related to our minority investment of $36 million and $40 million, respectively. 
 Also included in GAAP net income in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2015 were noncash stock-based compensation expenses of $14 million and $46 million, respectively. 
 Adjusted revenues in the fourth quarter of 2016 were $489.4 million, up 21% compared to $403.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
 Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased 13% to $180.5 million or $1.90 per diluted share compared to $160.2 million or $1.70 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
 Fourth quarter results reflect the impact of the macroeconomic environment, which continues to be unfavorable versus prior year. When we talk about the macroeconomic environment, we are referring to the impact that market fuel spread margins, fuel prices and foreign exchange rates have on our business. 
 Changes in foreign exchange rates from the fourth quarter of 2015 were mixed and overall negatively impacted revenue during the quarter by approximately $10 million. 
 Fuel prices have finally started to stabilize and were mostly neutral versus the fourth quarter of 2015, but spreads were unfavorable during the quarter. And although we cannot precisely calculate the impact of these changes, spreads negatively impacted revenues by approximately $9 million. 
 In total, we believe the impact of these changes negatively impacted our fourth quarter revenues by approximately $19 million and adjusted net income per diluted share by approximately $0.15. 
 On a macro-adjusted basis, revenue was up 24% and adjusted net income was up approximately 21%. On a constant-macro basis, organic revenue growth was approximately 8% for the quarter. 
 Now let's shift over and discuss some other drivers of our fourth quarter performance. For our North American segment, most of our lines of business performed well. Some of the positive drivers in North America revenue during the quarter were similar to the last several quarters, including our MasterCard product, which had revenue growth of approximately 16% over the fourth quarter of 2015, assuming constant fuel prices and spreads. 
 The CLC Group, provider of our lodging card programs, had another solid quarter, with 15% revenue growth over the fourth quarter of 2015. This revenue growth was driven primarily by increases in our CheckINN Direct product, which targets smaller accounts, partially offset by softness in some of our larger accounts that primarily do business in the oil and gas sector. 
 International segment revenue was up approximately 59% in the fourth quarter of 2016 versus the fourth quarter of 2015. This increase was driven primarily by the STP and Travelcard acquisitions; the Shell outsourcing business, up 57%; and Mexico, up 15% on a constant-macro basis. 
 On the downside, the economy in Brazil continued to struggle, negatively impacting our legacy businesses in those markets. 
 And finally, the same-store sales metric for the quarter has improved and was down a little less than 1% in the quarter. 
 Now moving down the income statement. Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $299 million compared to $284.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of 5.1%. As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses decreased to 58.1% of revenue compared to 66.1% in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
 Included in operating expenses are merchant commissions, processing expenses, bad debt, selling and general and administrative expense, depreciation and amortization expense and other operating net. 
 Also included in the fourth quarter of 2016 operating expense were ongoing expenses related to the acquisitions closed in the third quarter. 
 Also, stock-based compensation expense in the fourth quarter of 2016 was $13.9 million compared to $45.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, providing the largest portion of the drop in operating expense as a percentage of revenues. 
 Credit losses were $11.4 million for the fourth quarter or 7 basis points compared to $6.3 million or 4 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase in bad debt was primarily due to bad debt inherent in the acquisition of STP, the addition of new euroShell locations and normal quarterly fluctuations of certain businesses in the quarter. 
 Interest expense increased 33.1% to $22 million compared to $16.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase in interest expense was due primarily to the impact of additional borrowings for the STP and Travelcard acquisitions in the quarter and increases in the LIBOR rate in 2016. 
 We regularly evaluate our investments, which are not carried at fair value for other than temporary impairment in accordance with GAAP. As part of the review, we determined that the performance improvement initiatives planned in our minority investment continued to be more challenging to implement than we originally projected. 
 As a result, we have recorded a $36.1 million noncash impairment charge in the equity method investment line in the income statement in the fourth quarter of 2016. An impairment charge of approximately $40 million was booked in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
 Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2016 was 37.8% compared to 38.4% for the fourth quarter of 2015. However, the noncash impairment charge resulted in a reduction in basis in our minority investment for book purposes but not tax purposes, although this temporary book tax basis difference resulted in the company increasing its deferred tax asset related to its minority equity investment. The company also increased its valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset. 
 Excluding this noncash item, our tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2015 would have been 30.2% and 25.4%, respectively. 
 Also included in the fourth quarter of 2015 was an approximate $6 million favorable adjustment, primarily related to the reversal of prior year uncertain tax positions due to the statute of limitations expiring. A reduction in Comdata state tax rate due to Comdata being included in the company's state tax structure and the impact of a reduction in the U.K. statutory tax rate in 2017 through 2020. 
 Excluding the impacts of these unusual items, our income tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2015 would have been approximately 30.6%. 
 We reported $1.90 in adjusted net income per diluted share, up 12% compared to $1.70 in the fourth quarter of 2015. However, the unfavorable macro impacted our results by approximately $0.15 in adjusted net income per share in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the macro, our adjusted net income per share would have been approximately $2.05 or a growth rate of 21%. 
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $644 million in total cash. Approximately $169 million is restricted and consists of primarily customer deposits. 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $2.4 billion outstanding on our Term A loan, $245 million outstanding on our Term B loan and $615 million drawn on our revolver, leaving approximately $420 million of undrawn availability. 
 We had approximately $591 million borrowed on our securitization facility at the end of the quarter. 
 As of December 31, 2016, our leverage ratio was 2.93x EBITDA, which is below our covenant level of 4x EBITDA as calculated under our credit agreement. We intend to use our future excess cash flow to temporarily pay down the balance on our credit facility and securitization facility and maintain liquidity for acquisitions and other corporate purposes. 
 To remind everyone, on February 4, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase of up to $500 million of FleetCor's common stock during an 18-month period ending August 1, 2017. During the fourth quarter, the company repurchased approximately 1 million shares of stock for a total purchase price of approximately $152 million. In total, the company has repurchased approximately 1,259,000 shares with a total purchase price of approximately $188 million. 
 Finally, we are not a capital-intensive business, spending $17.1 million on CapEx during the fourth quarter of 2016. 
 Now on to our outlook for 2017. First, I want to update you on our latest thinking about the macroeconomic environment. For 2017, we are expecting the macro to have a favorable impact on our results. We are estimating the absolute price of fuel to be higher than the 2016 average and positively impact revenue in 2017 and fuel spreads return closer to historical levels. 
 Foreign exchange rates, however, are mixed and will be slightly unfavorable and negatively impact revenue by approximately $3 million compared to the 2016 average. 
 In aggregate, we believe the macroeconomic environment creates approximately a $30 million revenue tailwind and positively impact cash EPS by $0.12 per share. However, just as the macro is beginning to turn around, we estimate that higher interest rates and an unfavorable tax comparison versus 2016 will negatively impact 2017 EPS by approximately $0.24. 
 The total of these items creates a net unfavorable impact to adjusted net income per share of approximately $0.12 in 2017. 
 The good news is our organic revenue growth is projected to accelerate from 8% reported in 2016 to approximately 10% in 2017, excluding the impact of a positive macro, in line with our long-term objective. 
 Helping to drive the approximate 10% organic growth rate in 2017 are fuel cards, which are expected to grow organically in the 10% range, ahead of the approximate 9% organic growth rate in 2016. 
 Our toll business is expected to be up 18%; Corporate Payments, up 13%; and lodging, up approximately 13%. 
 That being said, our financial guidance is as follows: total revenues to be between $2,170,000,000 and $2,230,000,000; GAAP net income between $550 million and $570 million; GAAP net income per diluted share between $5.78 and $5.98; adjusted net income between $770 million and $790 million; and adjusted net income per diluted share between $8.10 and $8.30. 
 If you adjust our guidance for the net impact of the favorable macro, higher tax rates and higher interest rates, this guidance would have been approximately $8.32 in adjusted net income per share and represent approximately a 20% growth rate in adjusted net income per share for the year at the midpoint of the range. 
 Some of the assumptions we have made in preparing this guidance include the following: weighted fuel prices equals to $2.43 per gallon average in the U.S. for those businesses sensitive to the movement in the retail price of fuel for 2017 compared to $2.15 per gallon average in the U.S. in 2016, up approximately 13%; market spreads returning closer to historical levels, up slightly from the 2016 average; foreign exchange rates equal to the 7-day average ended January 22, 2017; interest expense of $100 million compared to $72 million in 2016; fully diluted shares outstanding of 95 million shares; and full year tax rate of approximately 29.5% compared to 28% in 2016, excluding the impact from the loss in equity method investment in 2016; and no impact related to acquisitions or material new partnership agreements not already disclosed. 
 For those of you that are looking for guidance for the first quarter, I want to remind everyone that our business has some seasonality and that typically, the first quarter is the lowest in terms of both revenue and profit. First quarter seasonality is impacted by weather, holidays in the U.S. and lower business levels in Brazil due to summer break and the Carnival celebration that occurs in the first quarter. 
 With that said, we are expecting our first quarter 2017 adjusted net income per share to be between $1.82 and $1.88. Additionally, our volumes build throughout the year and our new asset initiatives gain momentum throughout the year, resulting in higher organic growth rates and earnings per share in the second through fourth quarters. 
 And finally, we are providing a new set of metrics, some of which are included in today's press release and on the company's website under the Investor Relations section. They include revenue by geography, revenue by product category, major drivers of revenue, and revenue per transaction by segment and product category. Some of the highlights assumed in our 2017 guidance include: 2017 U.S. revenue, 65% of total revenue; Brazil at 18% of total revenue; and the U.K. at 10%; all other geographies at 7%. 
 In 2017, fuel cards will represent approximately 56% of our businesses globally; tolls, our second-largest product category, at 15%; Corporate Payments, 9%; gift, 8%; and lodging, 5%. 
 With that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And with that, our first question is from David Togut of Evercore. 
David Togut: Nice to see the acceleration in CLC revenue growth up to 15% from 8% in the third quarter. Can you talk a little bit more about the drivers behind that acceleration and what those drivers look like in '17? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, David, it's Ron. It's mostly just again lapping that big account business that we've talked about. They haven't recovered, but basically, we lapped most of it. So the small account growth rate is shining through more. And I think we have that business, I think we say something about it in Eric's script that we're planning that thing 13% to 15%, David, for '17. 
David Togut: Got it. And then just as a quick follow-up, 14% revenue growth at STP, very strong in the fourth quarter, and I'm glad to hear you're looking for 20% in '17. How are you able to power through some of the macro weakness in Brazil? 
Ronald F. Clarke: I think it's what we've said before. I mean, it's just a great company and a great brand, and we're doing, as we told you, a bunch of things that the prior owners weren't focused on, right, because they ran concessionaires. And so sales investment, pricing, new products. We've been working for 6 months on this transformation plan. We've got some of it already in market, so we think that's the additional lift. 
Operator: The next question is from Ashish Sabadra of Deutsche Bank. 
Ashish Sabadra: My question was about the global sales. Global sales was really strong in the fourth quarter, up 32%. I was just wondering if you could give some more color around what parts of the business were doing well on that front. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Ashish, it's Ron. I'd say again as we've said it before, that number is a little bit bumpy by quarter, so we disclosed, I think, a 7% number last quarter. So some of that is just kind of it rolling into this quarter. So if you think about the full year number, 20%, I say that's a more useful metric for you guys to understand. But I think generally, and on the page in front of me, I think the performance was good literally virtually everywhere. I think the only kind of soft spot I can recall was Brazil. But other than that, I think every business was way up, particularly the Comdata businesses they were way, way up from a year ago. 
Ashish Sabadra: That's great to hear. And then just a quick follow-up on the European oil [indiscernible] opportunity. I was wondering if there's any update on that front. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I think I tried to say in the script, we've got 2 active deals that tell us they're going to make decisions this year. I mean, I hate to say we've been told that before, but we are working hard on 2 things and hope to be able to say something about it this calendar year. 
Operator: The next question is from Ramsey El-Assal of Jefferies. 
Ramsey El-Assal: I wanted to ask about the same-store sales metric. It showed some nice improvement. Can you give us a little more color on what drove that? Was it the energy vertical, which was sort of the big drag kind of perking up? Was it other products or other geographies? 
Eric R. Dey: Ramsey, this is Eric. I think really a lot of it is we're basically lapping a year ago when we first started seeing the majority of the weakness, particularly in that energy sector and some of our fuel card businesses and even at CLC, where we saw 2 or 3 of our largest accounts experience significant softness. So we're effectively just lapping that for the most part. So we had basically under 1% same-store sales softness for the quarter. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. And as a follow-up to one of the questions that came before me, the STP growth rate of 14%, obviously, that's some acceleration versus the full year number last year. I'm just trying to get a better sense of, is that acceleration due to you guys now implementing your plan there as opposed to any type of just uptick in the business? I know you mentioned Brazil in general for the macro front was still quite soft. Is this to say that you really are already on the ground there and these tests you're talking about are -- you're starting to implement some revenue opportunity there? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Ramsey, it's Ron. I wouldn't give it that much credit. I think I said before, we bought it because it's a terrific business and it's got a great team. So they did have some things in stride when we bought it that we've kind of pushed along. And I'd say our impact so far would be small, maybe a point or so of that. But the important thing is that we're in market with a variety of things. So it gives me confidence that we can push those things into the numbers this year. So I'd say no, not a lot in the number in Q4, but a lot of learning. 
Operator: The next question is from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. 
 And the next question is from Oscar Turner of SunTrust. 
Oscar Turner: I was just wondering if you could provide an update on the rollout of the open loop card in Europe. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Oscar, it's Ron. I'd say there, unfortunately, not too much to update. I think we spent most of last year testing. We had a product in market. We've been reworking it. We've had a team or 2 selling it. We've got in the hundreds, not in the thousands, of clients using it. So I would say we actually had a big review a week or so ago. I'd say we're still retooling. We're learning a bunch of things about what we need to make the product; b, to get it to compete well against the private-label cards there. So I'd say still working it. I mean, the good news is if we get it figured out, we've been working it for a while, it's going to be hard to get chased because it's pretty complicated. But no, not a lot of progress yet. 
Oscar Turner: Okay. And then I think you mentioned exploring opening your MasterCard and Visa fleet cards to nonfuel spend. I was just looking for more color into that. Would this be in every geography? And then also, how long do you think that would take to implement? 
Ronald F. Clarke: That's a great question. I'd say strategically, this is one of the kind of big ideas for the company and a big upside for the core fuel card business because obviously, it's the big part of the business with hundreds of thousands of clients. So as we've gone from proprietary fuel cards running in proprietary networks to MasterCard here in the U.S. and Visa in the U.K., we've now gotten through the technical and certification and regulatory gates and have been in the market here for, I think about a year now. And so it's working. We're finding that certain clients want some additional controlled spending, for example, like construction clients. We open it up and let them buy construction supplies plus fuel. And so what we're going to do is go back not only into the client base, but as we're prospecting and start to reposition the card a bit, it's just a controlled card that could buy fuel plus mobility things, like public transportation or tolls or vertical things like construction supplies. And so if we can get that right, the leverage and incremental spend in revenue against the same client base is good; and b, I think it gives us a pretty advantaged value prop against others. There's not many others that have that. So we're on that point. 
Operator: The next question is from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: I really like the new disclosures. I just wanted to ask how we should focus or analyze some of those lines. I know it's fresh for all of us. So should we look at the product categories and then the transaction growth versus revenue per tran? Just any tips would be great. 
Eric R. Dey: Tien-tsin, this is Eric. Ask and you shall receive. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: We love data, so we've got to figure out how to use it. 
Eric R. Dey: I understand. Well, you've got a lot of it now. I think the reality is listen, I mean, there's a lot of numbers bouncing around when compare '15 to '16. Some of the business, obviously, has some kind of macro in it, so they're kind of some of them are hard to look at. Some of the businesses, like toll as an example, really didn't exist prior to 2016, so you've got to really look at it really in 2017 because we only owned STP for effectively 4 months. So some of those categories are going to be new. And then some of them that we've owned for multiple years, like fuel card as an example, the trend is going to be more consistent with kind of where it is today. So between '15 and '16, fuel card was impacted by the macro. But between '16 and '17, obviously, the macro is mostly kind of neutralized. So it'll be both, right? I mean, when we grow our business organically, it is through some combination of new sales. We talked about that, so call it, to pick a round a number, about half of our organic growth comes from our new sales for the year, and then kind of the other half comes from some combination of new rate initiatives and new product initiatives. So it comes -- it's going to come in both of the lines. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Tsien, let me just add because I do want to make sure you get some return from this. So a couple of tips, to use your word. One is, don't miss the diversification point, right? So in '14, 75% of the company, fuel cards. In '17, 55%, 56%, so almost half the company is nonfuel cards. Second tip is 10% organic growth plan for '17 don't miss the fuel cards, which are half the company, is planned at 10%. So people out there that think oh, oh, they have to diversify to grow the business 10%, don't miss that. And then don't miss that the second group of products, call them Corporate Payment products, are all growing more than 10%, which means the bucket of other is growing less than 10%, and we may do something with that bucket, as I've said previously. So we're trying to get the company positioned as we deemphasize that "other category". The mix will by its very nature, improve the growth rate going forward. So that would be my second tip, I think. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Okay. That's good to see the portfolio, obviously. So I guess, as my follow-up, maybe just more of a clarification. Maybe 2 clarifications, if that's okay. The 20% sales and the strong fourth quarter, what sort of the new sales outlook for 2017? I think I heard a 15% figure in your prepared remarks. 
Ronald F. Clarke: You got it. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Okay. So that is that. And then the second one was just was just the macro flow-through, the $30 million in the $0.12 translation. I guess, it doesn't seem to be as favorable as the drag was in previous quarter. Is there a difference in the sensitivity on the up versus down with the macro or am I just splitting hairs? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I think again, maybe we confused. We use the word macro, Tien-tsin, forever to be fuel price, fuel spreads and FX, those 3 things. So we're saying today that we're assuming and going to church that '17 is quite positive against those 3 things to the tune of $30 million in revenue lift, so call it 1 point to 2 of growth, right, just from that. But the 2 things that are kind of also quasi-macro, interest in the tax compare are going the wrong way. So the benefit of the first 3 against the negative of the second 2 ends up at about was it $0.12? 
Eric R. Dey: $0.12 negative. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Negative. But here's what I'd say to everybody. We're sick of macro, probably like everyone else. So call it even. We're just happy to be looking at a year where it's tiny in terms of what the impact would be from the world to us. 
Operator: Our next question is from Bob Napoli of William Blair. 
Robert Napoli: On the Corporate Payments business, just looking at for the full year, you had transaction growth of 20%, revenue growth of 10%. What it is the mix in there that's causing that? And what type of trends are you looking for as far as transaction versus revenue in Corporate Payments 2017? 
Eric R. Dey: Hey, Bob. This is Eric. As we've called out for several quarters now, we've seen some softness in the health care vertical in virtual cards. And it really is health care kind of dragging it down from a rate perspective. There's been a couple of large accounts that kind of opted out that were relatively profitable. We've also renegotiated a few contracts from a rate standpoint, so a little bit lower than where they are now. So that's been kind of impacting the rate versus the volume. Now I want to make sure you're kind of clear. I mean, we are selling that product in bushel barrels. So I mean, we are -- we're going to grow that business basically from a volume perspective going forward, and that's what's driving the favorability. 
Robert Napoli: Okay. And then just on your balance sheet, fixed -- I mean, you have -- I don't know if you have any fixed rate debt. In an environment where rates are likely -- more likely than not to go up from here, why not at this point, even today, where different  rates go, you have some very attractive fixed rate debt out there, why not fix a chunk of your debt? 
Eric R. Dey: Bob, we've looked at that historically, and we're still looking at it. We've had a lot of conversations about it internally. I think that we've obviously had some hedges in place in the past. We've never come out ahead in a hedge. And given our relatively low, low leverage today and the room that we have under our covenant, it really isn't a necessity for us. And we actually don't believe we can come out ahead of it. If you look at it over the next kind of 3 years and the analysis we've done, it just -- we just don't believe it's really a situation we come out ahead. 
Operator: The next question is from Darrin Peller of Barclays. 
Darrin Peller: I just want to touch on the outlook, it's -- having covered you guys for a number of years now, if you go back a few years ago or even 2 years ago, you've had a precedent of being fairly conservative, I think, in your outlook with regard to different assumptions that you left room for, whether it's accretion from deals or other variables. Macro headwinds made that a little challenging last year. Your growth seems to be really now reaccelerating. Is there elements of that in this outlook? Anywhere we can keep in mind that's sort of conservative versus baseline? How should we really think about that? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Darren, it's Ron. I would say -- I don't know if those adjectives work for us. We tried to get -- give numbers we can make. We always have. And I'd say this year is no different. And b, we only include what we own. We don't build in things we're working on in the pipeline or buybacks we haven't done. So I would say, to your point, one of the reasons we beat our opening guidance for most of the year is just generally we actually do something during the year that's accretive that's obviously not in our plan today, the 1st of February. So that's how we'd say it. I wouldn't say, oh this is a sandbag. But we are trying to give you a number we can get. 
Darrin Peller: Okay. And I mean, do you think there are things that could potentially be done this year that are not in the plan yet in terms of whether it's M&A or other partnerships that could happen in 2017, specifically? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. That's why I tried to call out hey, we're -- we've got a couple on each side on the partner outsourcing side and on the deal side. Whether we'll pull the trigger, like always, we try to be smart, not get rushed by people. But there's certainly activity and opportunity to pull the trigger. 
Darrin Peller: All right. That's great. And then just one follow-up on the -- just looking at the new disclosure, if we think about your guidance, I mean, it was helpful to get your disclosure and all the growth channels. Specifically, the fuel cards breakdown, you had about 1% growth in the overall revenues in '16, and a lot of that was really just fuel prices, I think, right? If we look at that growth rate and also look at the Corporate Payments, I just wanted to get more color on that, too. I mean, I think you mentioned just given the bookings growth, that could be pretty material again in 2017. What's actually happening in that business with regard to incremental industry verticals being added? I know construction was an area you guys are always good. Give us a little more color because it seems like a really strong opportunity long term. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, it's Ron again, Darrin. I'd say on the fuel cards, I don't know if it was in Eric's comments, but that penciled out about 9% organic if you throw out the fuel price and the spreads for '16. And we have that planned at 10% for 2017. Corporate Payments was kind of mid-double-digits, and we're now looking, again, mid, call it, say mid-double-digits. I think the answer is, which is a good one is, that there's not a lot of hurt in your head on Corporate Payments. We've got a good product, a lot of referenceable clients, a huge market. You mentioned construction. It's about 1/4 of our direct business there, and we have 3% of the market. So this is a game of just getting at it. We put 60 people on the streets from 5 2 years ago, and they're getting trained and getting the pipeline. And we doubled the sales last year from the year before. So I think the way to think about it is just chasing what we're doing and then getting the stuff onboard it is going to grow that business certainly over the next 2 to 3 years. So we are trying not to overcomplicate it. We're trying to just get at what's working. 
Operator: The next question is from Danyal Hussain of Morgan Stanley. 
Danyal Hussain: I just want to clarify something on the organic growth. So I think same-store improved pretty dramatically from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. That's the key ingredient, obviously, for the organic growth. But you didn't really see much of an uptick, so just wondering if you could bridge that for us. 
Eric R. Dey: Danyal, this is Eric. Again, we kind of compare that. Is it really a quarter-to-quarter comparison as much as it's a year-over-year comparison? So I would say, first of all, so you guys understand, the organic growth really came in exactly kind of there we thought it was going to be. In the third quarter, I think it was down about 2.5%. In this quarter, it was down kind of under 1%. But again, you compare it to the prior year really as in a quarter-to-quarter kind of thing. And again, this year, we were really lapping a lot of softness that really started to materialize a year ago in kind of the energy sector, both on the rail side and on the fuel side. So we are kind of getting back to more of a normal same-store sales kind of a growth area. And I think our business is going to -- as we've been talking about in the call, is going to reaccelerate next year from an organic growth perspective. We ended this year at around, if you average all 4 quarters, around 8%, and we're going to accelerate to around 10% next year. And again, we're going to see double-digit growth rates in fuel cards, Corporate Payments, tolls and lodging next year. So again, I think we're going to be in a pretty good place. 
Danyal Hussain: Okay. And then just to clarify, the organic growth for next year, that's 10% for the full year. And if Speedway is kicking in, I think you said at the beginning of the second quarter, and it probably takes a couple of quarters to ramp. Would that suggest maybe you're starting off the year closer to 8% and exiting a couple points higher than 10%? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I don't know if I'd use the word 8%, but for sure, it will build as we layer in the things that we talked about -- Speedway, STP, pricing, the onboarding of the Corporate Payments thing, MasterCard raised its interchange starting April. There are 3 or 4 things that will become additive as we walk through the year. So our exit will certainly be higher than 10%, and our entry will be a bit lower than 10%. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. It comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Most of my questions have been answered, and good quarter. Maybe just on Speedway. Could you just talk about how much of Speedway actually gets factored into this year. And is it more of it gets accounted for the following? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Sanjay. I'm not exactly sure of the question, but the short answer is yes, we -- there's a card portfolio Speedway's built up over x period of time, and we've done IT and are converting, right, sending cards out or issuing cards to bring people across. That's happening as we're on this call. And so call it sometime in Q2, all of that business will be running on our systems. And then we will start to kind of treat that portfolio as you walk through kind of Q3 and Q4. So it costs money, I'd say to have that thing in the first quarter, and it starts to kind of create some money in the fourth quarter. So the exit rate of revenue into '18 will be dramatically higher than the full year number for '17. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: And do we have a sense of kind of how to dimensionalize that? 
Ronald F. Clarke: I don't know. I think we told you guys that it's the fifth largest fuel retailer and that their card portfolio is commensurate to larger than their retail side. So in English, their card portfolio is probably in the top 4. So it's a big piece of business. But because of confidentiality, we don't say much more. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Got it. And final question, just obviously we've heard a lot about the political landscape and how it's reinvigorated kind of business optimization. Are you seeing any of that kind of flow through into your end markets? 
Eric R. Dey: I would say that's too early to call. At this point, obviously, it's kind of just beginning. I mean, from our perspective, it would be coming in improved volumes, so it's just too early for us to kind of see whether same-store sales are actually going to improve. Ask me in 12 months and maybe we'll have a different sentiment. And then we're all keeping our fingers crossed from a tax perspective that we're going to see lower tax rates going forward, but we'll have to wait and see what happens. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: And how would that tax, when we think about those tax implications, could you maybe just talk about how those flow through for you guys? 
Eric R. Dey: Well, I mean, yes, they lower the corporate tax rate. I mean, obviously, they'll have a direct impact on our bottom line. But until we see what the exact plan is and spend some time evaluating what the plan is, we just -- we won't know. But certainly, everybody believes that it's going to be lower than where it is today. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, we'd also like to repatriate the cash too if you guys want to call Washington. That would be another [indiscernible]. 
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. 
Ronald F. Clarke: It's a wrap, I think. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. 
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.

===== 2016 Q3  (2016-11-01 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the FleetCor Technologies, Inc. Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. 
 I'd now like to turn the call -- the conference over to your host, Mr. Eric Dey, Chief Financial Officer of FleetCor Technologies. Thank you. You may begin. 
Eric R. Dey: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. By now, everyone should have access to our third quarter press release. It can be found at www.fleetcor.com under the Investor Relations section. 
 Throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than other companies' similarly titled non-GAAP information. Quantitative reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable information appears in today's press release and on our website as previously described. 
 Also, we are providing 2016 guidance on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis with a reconciliation of the 2. 
 Finally, before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements. This includes forward-looking statements about our 2016 guidance, new products and fee initiatives and expectations regarding business development and acquisitions. They are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore, you should not put undue reliance on them. These results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K and on our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Others are described in our annual report on Form 10-K. These documents are available on our website as previously discussed at www.sec.gov. 
 With that out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay, Eric. Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining the call today. Upfront here, I'll plan to cover 3 subjects. First, I'll comment on our Q3 results. Second, I'll update you on our acquisition and business development progress. And lastly, I'll provide updated 2016 guidance. 
 Okay. So on to the quarter. We reported Q3 revenue of $484 million and cash EPS of $1.92. That represents 7% top line and 15% bottom line on a reported basis. The macro environment continues to challenge our performance during the quarter. Lower fuel prices and weaker FX negatively impacted revenue by about $28 million and cash EPS by about $0.16 compared to the prior period. 
 On a macro-neutral or like-for-like basis, revenue growth would have been 13% and cash EPS growth, 25%. So 13% top, 25%, bottom, better than our stated targets. It appears, fortunately, that we're finally beginning to lap the challenging macro conditions over the last couple of years, with the environment potentially setting up to be at least neutral in 2017. 
 Okay. So on to the drivers of Q3 growth, really, 3 things: Organic revenue growth, the STP acquisition and tax favorability drove the majority of our Q3 top and bottom line growth. 
 So first off, we had organic or like-for-like growth of 8% in Q3. It was a bit of a mixed bag, but we got strong performances from our MasterCard product, up 28%; our Comdata businesses, up about 10%; our Shell Europe outsourcing business, up 80%; and our Mexico business, up 13%. So a number of good performances. 
 Our Brazilian and Russian businesses continue to drag on our performance along with same-store sales. Same-store revenues continued quite soft again in Q3, down approximately 2.5% versus the prior year. A second driver in the quarter, the STP and Travelcard deals. They both contributed to our Q3 growth. STP came in about where we expected, its revenue up double digits year-to-date. 
 Lastly, we got help from the implementation of our new stock option accounting policy and some tax work that contributed to a significantly lower tax rate in the quarter. 
 In terms of new sales for the quarter, bookings grew 7% versus the prior year, but we did have some really good sales performance inside of that. A number of our businesses grew new sales in excess of 50% in the quarter. Those included Mexico, Comdata Trucking, Comdata Corporate Payments, CLC and Shell Europe all grew sales of 50% plus in the quarter. So quite good. 
 So look, in summary, Q3 was slightly better than we had expected and above our August guidance. The tax work and some early SVS card orders contributed to a stronger Q3 than we had outlooked, a few cents of which will come out of our Q4 estimate. 
 All right. Let me transition over to our acquisition and business development update, most significant STP. We closed STP on September 1, so [Audio Gap] for about 2 months now. We continue to like that business a lot. We've developed a comprehensive transformation plan, outlining a number of ways in which we can accelerate STP's profit growth. We've got the STP management team involved, and the CEO committed to drive this transformation agenda. We're adding some resources, both new management and outside help, to support these initiatives. 
 We continue to like the significant cross-sell opportunities that we see, along with the upside in both digital and telesales channels that are things in FleetCor's wheelhouse. STP continues to perform quite well in its own right. Revenues up about 10% year-to-date, and its profit contribution in September roughly on our forecast. So we'll continue to update you on our progress at STP as we begin to test some of these new ideas and get a better fix on the expected 2017 contribution. 
 Next update, the Shell Europe outsourcing project, that conversion is now complete. So last market was converted in August from a program that started about 2 years ago. We converted 11 Continental European markets in total to our systems and our back office. The Shell program will now exit 2016 at a higher revenue run rate as a result of all 11 markets now being online. And of note, I'd say slightly above our internal expectations when we first signed up for the program. So now the priority shifts to selling and growth and delivering volume for Shell. 
 Lastly, we continue to work a couple of European oil RFPs along with a couple additional plant the flag acquisition opportunities. Getting a stronger foothold in Continental Europe and getting after that large opportunity set continues to be a top priority for us. Our goal is to make Continental Europe, the region, a major revenue contributor to FleetCor over the midterm through more acquisitions, more major oil outsourcing contracts and eventually, more penetration of a FleetCor universal fuel card. So again, we believe that region will be a significant contributor over time. 
 Finally, let me transition over to guidance. As of today, we're increasing our full year 2016 cash EPS guidance from $6.83 to $6.86 at the midpoint. That flows through our Q3 peat, which again includes some accelerated tax benefits and SVS card orders that we're expecting in Q4. In addition, in that guidance, we're assuming a bit weaker Q4 macro than we guided to last time. 
 So in summary, a good Q3, slightly better than expected; 13% top line, 25% bottom line growth on a macro-neutral basis; 7% new sales growth; STP closed and contributing per expectation; the Shell Europe conversion complete; Speedway's initial conversions beginning and a few interesting transactions still in front of us; and another guidance raise to $6.86. So all in all, a very good place to be. 
 So with that, let me turn the call back over to Eric. He'll provide some additional detail on the quarter and our guidance. Eric? 
Eric R. Dey: Thank you, Ron. For the third quarter of 2016, we reported revenue of $484.4 million, up 7.3% compared to $451.5 million in the third quarter of 2015. The revenue from our North American segment increased 3.3% to $345.9 million from $334.9 million in the third quarter of 2015. Revenue from our International segment increased 18.9% to $138.6 million from $116.5 million in the third quarter of 2015. 
 For the third quarter of 2016, GAAP net income increased 11% to $129.6 million or $1.36 per diluted share from $116.8 million or $1.24 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2015. The other financial metrics that we routinely use are adjusted revenues and adjusted net income, which we sometimes also refer to as cash net income or cash EPS. Adjusted revenues equal our GAAP revenues less merchant commissions. We use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate the company's revenues net of the commissions that are paid to merchants who participate in certain card programs. We prepare adjusted net income to eliminate the effects of noncash or nonrecurring items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance. A reconciliation of adjusted revenues and adjusted net income to GAAP numbers are provided in Exhibit 1 of our press release. 
 Adjusted revenues in the third quarter of 2016 were $456.2 million, up 8.7% compared to $419.8 million in the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted net income for the third quarter of 2016 increased 16.3% to $183.3 million or $1.92 per diluted share compared to $157.6 million or $1.67 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2015. 
 Third quarter results reflect the impact of the macroeconomic environment, which continued to be unfavorable versus prior year. When we talk about the macroeconomic environment, we are referring to the impact that market fuel spread margins, fuel prices and foreign exchange rates have on our business. Changes in foreign exchange rates from the third quarter of 2015 were primarily negative and overall, we believe negatively impacted revenue during the quarter by approximately $10 million. 
 Fuel prices and spreads were also unfavorable during the quarter. And although we cannot precisely calculate the impact of these changes, we believe they negatively impacted revenues by approximately $18 million. In total, the impact of these changes negatively impacted our third quarter revenues by approximately $28 million and adjusted net income per diluted share by approximately $0.16. 
 On a macro-adjusted basis, revenue was up 13%, and adjusted net income would have been up approximately 25%. On a constant-macro basis, organic revenue growth was approximately 8% for the quarter. 
 For the third quarter of 2016, transaction volumes increased 19.5% to 498.6 million transactions compared to 417.1 million transactions in the third quarter of 2015. Transaction volumes, excluding SVS, were up approximately 5% in the North American segment, due primarily to growth in our MasterCard and Corporate Payments businesses. SVS transactions can fluctuate between quarters and negatively impacted third quarter comparison. Also, the SVS business has a significant amount of transactions at a very low revenue per transaction, so fluctuations in SVS transactions can have a meaningful impact on the segment. 
 Transaction volumes in our International segment grew 179% and were primarily impacted by the addition of the new Shell markets in 2015 and '16; a small tuck-in acquisition in the first quarter of 2016; and the STP acquisition, which closed on August 31, 2016. 
 Revenue per transaction can vary based on the geography, the relevant merchant and the customer relationship, the payment product utilized and the types of products or services purchased. The revenue mix is influenced by our acquisitions, organic growth in the business and fluctuations in the macroeconomic environment. 
 In discussing revenue per transaction in the North American segment, we typically exclude the impact of the SVS business, which had approximately 270 million transactions in the quarter at a very low revenue per transaction. Revenue per transaction in the North American segment for the third quarter of 2016, excluding the SVS business, decreased 2% to $2.83 from $2.89 in the third quarter of 2015, due primarily to the impact of lower fuel prices during the quarter and lower fuel spread margins versus prior year. Adjusting for the impact of the macroeconomic environment in SVS, revenue per transaction increased approximately 4% in North America. 
 In the International segment, revenue per transaction decreased 57%, due primarily to unfavorable foreign exchange rates and the mix impact of the STP acquisition, a small tuck-in acquisition in Brazil and Travelcard in the Netherlands, which have transactions at much lower revenue per transaction than the historical average. Foreign exchange rates impacted revenues unfavorably by approximately $10 million in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the acquisitions and adjusting for foreign exchange rates, revenue per transaction would have been $2.62 versus $2.56 in the third quarter of 2015. 
 Now let's shift over and discuss other drivers of our third quarter performance. For our North American segment, most of our lines of business performed well, resulting in approximately 9% organic growth in the quarter on a constant fuel price and spread basis. Many of the positive drivers in North America during the quarter were similar to the last several quarters, including our MasterCard product, which had revenue growth of approximately 28% over the third quarter of 2015. 
 Our Comdata business also performed well in the quarter and, on a constant-macro basis, was up approximately 10% in the quarter. Also, our Pac Pride business continues to perform well, with revenue up approximately 29% in the third quarter of 2016 versus the third quarter of 2015. 
 International segment revenue was up approximately 27% on a constant-macro basis in the third quarter of 2016 versus the third quarter of 2015. This increase was driven primarily by the STP and Travelcard acquisitions, the Shell outsourcing business up 82% and Mexico up 13%. On the downside, the economies in Brazil and Russia continue to struggle, negatively impacting revenues in those markets. 
 Now moving down the income statement. Total operating expenses for the third quarter were $293.4 million compared to $263 million in the third quarter of 2015, an increase of 11.5%. As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses increased to 60.6% of revenue compared to 58.3% in the third quarter of 2015. Included in operating expenses are merchant commissions, processing expenses, bad debt, selling and general administrative expense, depreciation and amortization expense and other operating net. 
 Included in the third quarter 2016 operating expense were ongoing expenses related to the acquisitions closed in the quarter and a favorable impact of approximately $2 million resulting from lower foreign exchange rates in our foreign businesses. Also, stock-based compensation expense in the third quarter of 2016 was $18.1 million compared to $15 million in the third quarter of 2015. Deal-related expenses in the quarter were approximately $3 million compared to only $300,000 in the third quarter of 2015. Credit losses were $10.8 million for the third quarter or 7 basis points compared to $5.3 million or 3 basis points in the third quarter of 2015. The increase in bad debt was primarily due to bad debt inherent in the acquired STP business, the addition of new euroShell locations and normal quarterly fluctuations in certain businesses in the quarter. 
 Interest expense increased 3.8% to $17.8 million compared to $17.2 million in the third quarter of 2015. The increase in interest expense was due primarily to the impact of additional borrowings for the STP and Travelcard acquisitions in the quarter. Equity method investment loss of $2.7 million decreased from a loss of $6.1 million in the third quarter of 2015. The prior year loss was impacted by costs incurred to restructure the operations of the business. 
 Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2016 was 23.9% compared to 29.4% for the third quarter of 2015. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the early adoption of the new guidance on accounting for share-based payments to employees in the third quarter and the impact of a reduction in the U.K. tax rate. 
 In summary, we reported $1.92 in adjusted net income per diluted share, about $0.06 above our expectation. And as I just mentioned, there were a number of puts and takes in the quarter such as the macro was a little worse than what we previously projected. Same-store sales softness came in at approximately 3%, worse than our expectation. And on the positive side, SVS revenue came in a little better than we thought, and we realized more tax savings than we previously projected. 
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $605 million in total cash. Approximately $200 million is restricted and consists of primarily customer deposits. As of September 30, 2016, we had approximately $2.4 billion outstanding on our Term A loan, $246 million outstanding on our Term B loan and $597 million drawn on our revolver, leaving approximately $138 million of undrawn availability. We had approximately $656 million borrowed in our securitization facility at the end of the quarter. 
 As of September 30, 2016, our leverage ratio was 2.98x EBITDA, which is below our covenant level of 4x EBITDA as calculated under our credit agreement. We intend to use our future excess cash flow to temporarily pay down the balance on our revolving credit facility and securitization facility and maintain liquidity for acquisitions and other corporate purposes. 
 Finally, we are not a capital-intensive business, spending approximately $17.1 million on CapEx during the third quarter of 2016. 
 Now on to our outlook for the remainder of 2016. First, I want to update you on our latest thinking about the macroeconomic environment. We believe the macro will negatively impact adjusted revenues by approximately $3 million to $4 million and adjusted net income per diluted share by approximately $0.02 to $0.03 versus assumptions for the fourth quarter in our prior guidance. Foreign exchange rate movements have been a bit mixed lately, with Brazil mostly favorable but the U.K. pound trending much lower. In total, we believe that FX rates will have an approximately $2 million unfavorable impact compared to assumptions used for the fourth quarter in our prior guidance. We believe market spread margins are mostly in line with our prior guidance. 
 And finally, fuel prices have continued to be mixed since the last earnings call. And as a result, we have updated our guidance to reflect a slightly lower fuel price. For the fourth quarter, our assumptions negatively impacted revenue by approximately $1 million to $2 million versus last quarter's guidance. Versus prior year actuals and the macroeconomic environment guidance assumptions represent approximately a $10 million to $12 million revenue headwind and approximately a $0.06 to $0.07 cash EPS headwind for the fourth quarter versus the same period in 2015. 
 That being said, our financial guidance is as follows: Total revenues to be between $1,810,000,000 and $1,830,000,000; GAAP net income to be between $469 million and $477 million; GAAP net income per diluted share to be between $4.94 and $5.02; adjusted net income to be between $648 million and $654 million; and adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $6.82 and $6.90 or $6.86 at the midpoint. This guidance represents on a macro-adjusted basis approximately a 13% growth in revenue and 18% growth in adjusted net income per diluted share for the year at the midpoint of the range. 
 Some of the assumptions we have made in preparing this guidance include the following: Weighted average fuel price of $2.29 for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the $2.31 assumption used in our prior guidance and approximately $2.35 per gallon average in the fourth quarter of 2015; market spreads lower in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 and unchanged from assumptions used in the last earnings call; foreign exchange rates equal to the 7-day average ended October 13; the impact of the pound negatively impacts prior guidance for the fourth quarter by approximately $2 million; same-store sales softness in the fourth quarter of approximately 3%; continued weakness in the company's Brazilian and Russian businesses; fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately 95.2 million shares; and a fourth quarter tax rate of approximately 30%. 
 And with that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Togut from Evercore ISI. 
David Togut: Could you just update us on CLC revenue growth trends you saw in the third quarter and any underlying drivers? 
Ronald F. Clarke: David, it's Ron. It's a little softer in Q3, under 10% quarter. And that was driven by the same thing I told you last time: The top 25 biggest accounts in the quarter were down 16% versus the prior year. So that pulled again the growing portions of the business down. But the good news is we'll have fundamentally have lapped that finally. So as we head into this quarter and forward, we'll be past, hopefully, that reset of those big accounts. 
David Togut: Got it. And when you say under 10, the number I recall for Q2 was 9%. Was it below 9%? 
Ronald F. Clarke: It was. 
Eric R. Dey: It was just a little below that, David. But again, as Ron indicated, if you adjusted for the same-store sales softness with those larger accounts, I mean, the growth rate for the smaller accounts, which is where the growth has been coming for that business, was mostly in line with where it's been in the past. 
David Togut: Got it. And then if you could update us on the growth you saw in All-Star and how far through the Visa chip conversion you are? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes. So the second part of your question, we're about 75% to 80%, David, through. And the latest word is we'll be finished halfway through Q1, so a little bit more this year and then laps into the beginning. That kind of thing was kind of mid- to high single digits for the quarter. 
David Togut: Okay. So in line with what you saw for the second quarter? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes, similar to the second quarter. And again I think I said it repeatedly. We both need a, those cards to get implemented; and then b, we need users to use them in the right way. And if we get those 2 things, revenues will lift. So first things first. 
David Togut: Understood. And then on new sales bookings, you called out 7% growth for the quarter and 50%-plus growth in a number of areas. What were the areas of bookings that were on the soft side to get you down to 7%? 
Ronald F. Clarke: There obviously had to be some of those to end up plus 7%, right? But I'd say off the top of my head, Brazil -- again, not only revenues, but new sales continue to be quite soft. I think our telematics business was quite soft. I think our Russia business probably against the prior year, again, was probably quite soft. So those are the first 3 that come to mind. 
David Togut: Got it. And just finally, is the growth you're seeing in MasterCard, which continues to be very high, is this a sustainable level? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes, I think I mentioned last time, David, in that, I think we called out 28% kind of fuel price adjusted. I'd say again, that's probably 60-40 volume price would be my guesstimate of that 28. So we still have some price from a year-plus ago in that number. So I'd say it's a 10% to 20% per year grower based on how much we invest in sales. 
David Togut: Got it. Quick final question, if I could. Eric, on the FX impact, you said $10 million revenue negative, $2 million benefit to expenses. Are virtually all of the AllStar expenses in the U.K. for the AllStar business denominated in pounds? 
Eric R. Dey: They are, yes. 
Operator: Our next question is from Ramsey El-Assal from Jefferies. 
Ramsey El-Assal: On organic growth, I mean, it feels like North America performance was solid even factoring in telematics and sales you just talked about. But Brazil and Russia just pulled the total company organic growth rates sort of down. Can you comment on the trajectory in those markets? Are there any signs of stability or lapping tough comps? Or are those just kind of in something that tends to sort of freefall? 
Ronald F. Clarke: If I knew, Ramsey, the answer to that question, I'd say in Brazil, which was negative, it's still the formal employment problems. Not only is the market and the economy soft, but the formal employment portion, which is who uses our products, falls faster, if you will, than the total. So those were both negative. And I'd say there's no clear view that they're going to get a lot better soon. They were just both getting quite small, I guess, will be the one comment I'd make is that they're into -- they clearly are both below 5%. So the good news is although they're not performing well, they're not super important to the total. 
Eric R. Dey: Ramsey, if you believe the economists in Brazil, they all believe that the economy is starting to turn and will actually have positive GDP the next year or 2. So hopefully, the worst is behind us, and it's going to stabilize and move a little bit forward. So that's what most people are tending to believe, but we'll see. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. On STP and the realization of synergies from that deal, can you talk a little bit about your plan in terms of the timing of the realization of these synergies? I know you're just sort of getting started, but is that something that will be sort of flowing in over time? Or will we see sort of a step function with some very low-hanging fruit type synergies realized in one fell swoop in a particular quarter? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, so we have, I'd say, Ramsey, a very early view of the thing. And yes, we start getting some synergies as early as Q1 that kind of grow during the year. But I'd say most of it's going to depend on the testing. So we have identified kind of 7 areas to create improved performance. And we're, literally as soon as this month and next, in-market testing some of those things. So depending on how they test out will drive the pace at which we implement some of them. So again, I think when we talk again in 90 days and have baked our plan, we'll have a much clearer answer for you. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. And are you -- are your M&A efforts right now focused at all on similar electronic toll-type deals globally? I mean, I guess, how big of an opportunity is this for the company kind of going forward in terms of this being a focus area for different -- for new deals? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I mean, I think we like it a lot, so we got to learn a lot, right, in the last 2 years of diligence-ing the company. And I think I mentioned in a prior call that some of the owners, concessionaires, toll operators that owned STP are large, global and European operators. So obviously, we've made that connection and studied that Europe set up in some detail. So I'd say that yes, it increases our opportunity set and yes, we are going to see if we can do similar things in Europe. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Are these markets -- are there many markets structured like Brazil where it's sort of an open competitive environment? I mean, I know electronic tolls in some geographies are relatively monopolistic and maybe not necessary available for purchase. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, so the models are different. Obviously, you got lots of countries. Some are more kind of government controlled with the suppliers and more BPO kind of oriented, and you have other big markets that look a bit more like Brazil. But I'd say yes, there are targets and there are owners that we know in this space, and so we're trying to make sure we know a lot about it before we take a lot of big steps. But yes, that'll be in our acquisition sights going forward. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. Last quick one for me and then I'll hop back in the queue. Just an update on the European RFP. You had mentioned previously you expected maybe some resolution this year. Is that still a viable outcome or a possible outcome rather? Or any thoughts there would be helpful. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, so we're working on actually a couple. And the one that I mentioned I guess in the last call reported back 2 weeks ago that they've kicked the decision to Q1. So maybe not surprising for you guys on the call, but we did get that notice a couple of weeks ago. So we'll see. They have obviously worked on the thing for quite some period of time, so we're hopeful they'll land. 
Operator: Our next question's from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Just kind of quick clarification on the guidance. At the high end of the range, the revenues are obviously lower by like $40 million. And then you kind of went through some of the impacts. Could you just talk about other impacts that might be causing the delta, Eric? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes, I mean, there's a couple of things we talked a little bit about in the quarter. One is a little bit of a macro. The macro came in the third quarter a little bit worse than we thought. I think we called about $3 million or $4 million. And it's a similar number kind of in the fourth quarter. We think the macro is going to be a little bit worse. A lot of that's driven by FX rates because of the decrease in the U.K. pound and then a little bit in fuel price. So again, just call it, I don't know, $8 million -- $7 million, $8 million, $9 million, $10 million of kind of macro. We got some same-store sales softness that it looks like it's going to be higher than we had thought it was been kind of running in the 1% to 2% range. It looks like it going to be around 3%. So that extra kind of percentage or 2 is going to impact revenue a little bit in the third quarter and a little bit more kind of in the fourth quarter. And I would say the last thing that's going to impact revenue a little bit is -- and I think Ron touched on this, but we're running a little slower to implement some of the new initiatives that we thought were going to be implemented by kind of the middle of the third quarter. Looks like they'll probably be delayed till hopefully the beginning of next year. So the combination of those 3 things are kind of impacting revenue. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: And then when we think about what's bridging it, it's this tax benefit to some extent. Obviously, if it's not recurring, but as we look forward into next year, how do we bridge that gap that's created by this benefit? 
Eric R. Dey: Well, I think Ron said some things on the call. Again, I would say the organic growth was a little softer in the second half of the year. We were 8% kind of in Q3, and we'll see some similar softness kind of in the fourth quarter. But again, we've got some pretty good momentum heading into 2017. I mean, think of a, couple of acquisitions that we closed and the organic growth that's going to come around those deals. We got a full year of euroShell locations. We've got the implementation of Speedway, and then we've got the normal organic growth in the business again. So I think the combination of those things lets us step up and into a pretty good place, so. 
Ronald F. Clarke: You can give him the split up between onetime tax versus kind of forward tax. 
Eric R. Dey: Yes. I mean from a tax perspective, we called out on -- just so we're clear, on the last earnings call, that we were implementing this new guidance for stock option accounting. That was planned for the third quarter. So our tax rate in the third quarter ended up being a little bit more favorable than we thought it was going to be. We got a little bit more benefit out of that change in accounting in the third quarter than we had built into our forecast. And then the U.K. effectively decreased. They announced they were decreasing their corporate tax rate by 1%, which impacted the tax rate there as well. So that had a little bit more favorable impact in the third quarter than we had originally projected. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: So is there an ongoing benefit to the tax rate by that 1 percentage point in the U.K. or... 
Eric R. Dey: There is. There is. And so we're going decrease the rate from 18% to 17%, so that'll obviously have a favorable impact going forward for that business. And then the stock option accounting is a little more bumpy, but that is the new GAAP guidance and it's going to require us to do that more cash accounting on the exercise of stock option. So that'll be a little bumpy from kind of quarter-to-quarter, but we would expect the impact of that to be less as we go forward. 
Ronald F. Clarke: As employees sell, Sanjay, it'll -- we'll get benefit in '17. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Got it. Got it. And then one final question. I was just wondering -- I know there's a lot of moving parts, but is there a way to help us just think about the lapping of the FX and gas price impacts going forward to the growth rates? 
Eric R. Dey: I mean, I think a simple way to look at the thing is to look at the trends for calendar '16. So if you took fuel price Q1, 2, 3, 4 and created an average for '16 and then compared that to today's step off, that's how we think about all the environmental things. So what's cooked into our full year 2016 numbers and how does that full year average compare to today's step off. So in the case of fuel price, it looks like it's stepping off kind of around or a few cents better than our year-to-date average. Same with FX. Although to Eric's point, depending on where the pound settles here, it may still be a bit worse. But my -- in my comments, Sanjay I said that if we look at all the macro factors and how they set up today -- which obviously doesn't mean they're going to stay there, but if you look at all of them combined, we're kind of neutral, finally, looking forward versus the year-to-date this year. 
Operator: Our next question is from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. 
James Schneider: I think you said that Comdata was up 10% in the quarter. I don't think you gave the split out between trucking and corporate. Can you maybe give us a color on what trucking did? And then just more broadly, can you maybe talk about what same-store sales in the U.S. only did and as we go forward, how to think about that? Are we going to be in a situation where you're just going to get into the middle of '17 and lap that and then things will turn positive again? Or you think there's some macro factors that are swing that one way or the other? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Jim, this is Ron. They're about the same. They're kind of within a point of each other for the quarter. And in terms of softness, I'd say those 2 businesses probably looked a bit better than some of the other ones that we called out to get to the 2.5% total. So they're probably closer to kind of 1% that Eric called out. 
James Schneider: Got it. And then in terms of -- I mean, are we going to need anything more on the macro side to see improvement into 2017 once we lap those effects on the same-store sales weakness? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Again, in the Comdata businesses, there's not a lot. It's less than FleetCor Inc. And I'd say our forward view of those businesses, based on our early plans, are both double digit for 2017. 
James Schneider: That's helpful. And then one quick follow-up is you talked about the one European outsourcing RFP kind of pushing into Q1. Are there now others that you see in the hopper -- visibility into kind of materializing into -- in 2017 at some point? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, and that's why I mentioned the word 2. Yes, there are, Jim. 
Operator: Our next question is from Oscar Turner of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. 
Oscar Turner: So in the past, you've talked about a 10% constant macro organic revenue growth target for both geographic sets. And the 13% growth this quarter was moderately ahead of that. I'm just wondering, is there a chance you could continue to grow above that 10% target in the medium term given the strong bookings growth year-to-date? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. This is Ron. I'd say again we try to plan the business, again, to grow 10%. So we look at statistics of softness and loss rates and try to tee up our sales plan to deliver 10% growth. So although we're kind of halfway through our '17 budget, my expectation is that we will plan 2017 probably right around that same number. 
Oscar Turner: When we say the same number, the 10%? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Correct. 
Oscar Turner: Okay. And then just on Europe, can you provide an update on the projected time line for rollout of the European universal card? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, we're still -- I think I've commented previously that we're still trying to retooling. We've started and stopped and retooled and started and stopped and we're actually relaunching something new that we think is quite a bit better. So we are putting clients on. We have a couple sales teams selling the product, and we are trying to "make the product better." So I'd say that we've not stepped on the gas in terms of selling in a big way until we think we've got the product right. So still some work to do. 
Oscar Turner: Okay. And then finally, just a big-picture question. Recently, there's been a lot of news on self-driving cars and trucks. And just wondering, have you guys thought about this? And how do you assess the long-term potential threat or opportunity from this technology? 
Eric R. Dey: This is Eric. That's mostly captured in kind of same-store sales. So I think if you look at fuel efficiency or vehicle efficiency over some period of time, there is vehicle efficiency that's kind of built into our numbers that comes in terms of same-store sales softness. And then typically, in a normal year, you'd have GDP growth and that GDP growth effectively mostly offsets any softness from vehicle efficiency. So same-store sales historically, has run around neutral. Now is this going to be a bigger impact down the road? I mean, we'll have to wait and see. But certainly, we don't believe it's anytime soon. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Just a couple of adds. I think our view is it's a really, really long cycle, and two, that where we have been on and continue to be on diversifying the company. So I think if you look at our kind of Q3 numbers now, we're 40-ish percent nonfuel cars heading higher. So it would be a, we think kind of a long cycle to get there; and b, we'll be a different-looking company as we get there. 
Operator: Our next question is from Danyal Hussain from Morgan Stanley. 
Danyal Hussain: Just wondering if you could provide any more color on STP's contribution either revenue or maybe the organic growth I think, because it had decelerated into the second quarter. Just wondering what it looks like in the third. 
Eric R. Dey: Yes, I would say in general, STP's contribution was within line with our expectation, both from a revenue and from a profit perspective. And the organic growth in the business was also in line with our expectation. And I think Ron indicated that on a year-to-date basis, it's kind of running around 10%. So I would say we're off to a pretty good start with that. 
Danyal Hussain: Got it. And for Shell, you gave the run rate a while back, I think when you were still expecting it to be in 12 or 13 countries. Since then, things have changed. I think you lost one country but you've also built out the business a bit. So just wondering if you could provide a new -- a run rate for the business and an organic growth rate on a like-for-like basis just out of Shell. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Couple comments. So no, I won't get client-specific, but I will say that the exit rate and the plan for 2017 again is higher than when we "set the program up." And that's mostly because although there's a couple less markets, we took on an international, a cross-border piece of business that made the volume actually higher, which is part of the reason. And then, two, in terms of going forward, I think the best news, some of you actually saw it earlier this week is although it's a relatively small size client base because, by design, Shell gave us their small account. But the loss rate is low. And in fact, incredibly low, high single digits, which, for an average, 3 or 4 card account is a very, very low rate -- we include credit. So I would say that given the sales investment, that thing will be, again, a teens kind of grower going forward. 
Danyal Hussain: Perfect. And then last one, just on M&A. You gave some color on now potentially looking at business like STP. But a while back, you'd given some commentary on Corporate Payment being a potential avenue for M&A that you had to learn a bit more about the business. Is that still something you're thinking about? And do you see opportunity in the pipeline there? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes. I mean, the short answer is yes. I think as we, again, diversify into these related categories like food cards and toll and corporate payments, we want to make sure that we're smart or close to equally smart. But yes, we've been looking and meeting with targets in every one of those new lines of business. And so the expectation ought to be that yes, we will be buying businesses in those categories over time. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. 
Reginald Smith: It's actually Reggie filling in for Tien-tsin. I only had a few. I hear you guys you talked about the softness in Brazil at least in your legacy business. I guess, could you kind of frame the effect that softness could have or is having on STP? And how should we think about that in the context of what you guys -- how you're planning on squeezing out synergy revenues and things like that at STP? 
Ronald F. Clarke: It's Ron. That's actually a really good question. So the headline is that the existing or legacy businesses we have in Brazil are more employment benefit-related things. And so they're affected a bit more by this formal employment thing. Whereas the STP, which has a consumer side as well to it, is really just -- let me call it just more pure GDP affected. So I'd say that the good news is that business sets up to be just a bit less impacted by the Brazil macro. And then two, it's just a great business. I mean, it's a -- you don't grow a business 30% top line for 15 years being kind of okay. So I'd say the quality of that asset and that brand and that distribution model is just quite good. And so I think it sets up importantly, given its strong position and its brand and that, that you let people like us loose we -- you can imagine we've got some good ideas for improvement. So we want to make sure we're right. And if we are, we'll deliver a lot of synergies. 
Reginald Smith: Understood. If I could get one more question in. I guess you called out 50% booking growth in Corporate Payments in Comdata and trucking. I guess, what's kind of driving that? Is it new product? Is it a bigger sales force? I mean, that seems like a pretty meaningful increase in sales power, so just curious what the source was. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I think another good question. So the short answer there is yes, if you take Comdata, in particular, which is the trucking business and the Corporate Payments business, both of those grew their new bookings, the new accounts they acquired over 50%. Looking at one of them, one grew 180% and one grew 155%. So the majority of that, Reg, is incremental sales, headcount investment and the seasoning, finally, of those people. If you recall, back when we bought the company, they had fundamentally hardly any salespeople, right? They had a lot of account people, but not many kind of hunters hunting for new business. So we've ramped up the headcount in both of those businesses, but I think there are now more and more people are becoming productive in those ranks, and so it's turning into more production. And again, I think the encouraging news to David's opening is that, that will help bridge revenue growth right into '17. So you think about Corporate Payments with a 6- to 9-month lead time from sales to revenue. That's one of the drivers that will create a bit of a bounce back in organic as we head into next year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Hogan from William Blair. 
Brian Hogan: Question on the provision for losses. You mentioned in your prepared remarks the STP acquisition drills had kind of increased from the prior quarter, prior year. Is that a onetime item? Or should we kind of -- is that a higher-loss business? How should be think about the provision for credit losses? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes, it's just typically a little higher loss business. I mean, they do have a consumer piece to the business, so it runs a little bit higher from a bad debt prospective. But I would expect the -- certainly now, that the bad debt to kind of start off where it is, but we're obviously looking at the policies of the business and the practices of the business to see if we can improve those as well. So that's one of our synergy opportunities, putting our practices in place. But certainly, as we start out 2017, I would use the current run rate as of the bad debt number for the business as a whole. 
Ronald F. Clarke: But Brian, let me just add. It's Ron. I'd add to that again that most of the billing there has been kind of indifferent to risk levels, so it's been historically a business kind of 30-day pay, which obviously, when you look through a risk lens, there'll be some changes to either weekly or prepaid; and then b, almost all of the actual payment of the invoices is through direct debit. And so again, there's opportunities to tag some of the high-risk people to credit card to kind of move the risk. So I'd say that of the 7 areas that we're looking at reworking, that this is quite ripe, to Eric's point, in terms of putting in our practices and taking that number down. 
Brian Hogan: Right. You've done that very well in your other businesses. Eric, your consolidated revenue, excluding SVS, did you, as per transaction, did you give that number? 
Eric R. Dey: I did. I gave it for each of the segments. I thought that was going to be a little more relevant, so I gave it for the North America segment. 
Brian Hogan: That was a 2 83 number? 
Ronald F. Clarke: I'm sorry? 
Brian Hogan: That was the 2 83 number? Is that? 
Eric R. Dey: I'll look it up really quick. Yes, it was 2 83, excluding SVS in the North America segment. 
Brian Hogan: Right. And do you have it for the consolidated? 
Eric R. Dey: And that was pre-macro adjusted. I did not calculate it on a consolidated level. I have it. I just don't have it without SVS. 
Brian Hogan: All right. And actually -- go ahead -- The thoughts on the SVS business being a little lumpy. I mean, do you still want to retain that business? What are your thoughts about there? 
Ronald F. Clarke: So it's -- it's Ron again. So I'd say that, like all of these businesses, we've gotten a little clearer on what the thing is and is not, and we've got a really good guy running the business. So the performance with us has been a bit better than we thought. But I'd say, again, if we found a home that we liked more, we'll kind of keep chasing at that. But in the meantime, we've asked people to go get the clients and go get the numbers. So no news, no update beyond that. 
Brian Hogan: All right. And you started to ramp the Speedway contract or agreement. How long do you think you'll get up to being fully ramped? Does it take 3 months, 6 months? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, it's probably I think in our plans. Again, we've literally just started that in the last week or 2. I'd say it's about a 6-month process from kind of first set of clients to last set. So call it, kind of April, we should have the majority of the book across. 
Brian Hogan: And can you give us some --like, last quarter you kind of quantified a little bit in your third-largest U.S. customer. Is that still fair? Can you kind of put some directions around the size of that business? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, again, we don't necessarily give revenue for individual contracts. But again, it's the fifth largest U.S. retailer. It's even higher than that in terms of the size of its commercial card program. So it's one of the top 3 or 4 commercial card programs. And we've got 2 of them with BP and Chevron. So it's large and it's the same model as those other couple of accounts. So it will be -- once it's kind of fully up and operating and kind of getting similar to those size accounts. 
Brian Hogan: Sure. And then a number of transactions from STP, just a back of the envelope guess, for 1-month ownership. Was it about $70 million? Is that fair? And then should we just kind of annualize that number? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes, that's a good guess. $800 million and change is a good number for 12 months so 70 is a good number. 
Brian Hogan: All right. And then the revenue per transaction of that business, it's dropped, the international went down pretty low. Is that what we assume going forward there do you think? 
Eric R. Dey: I would think we're going to level set the expectations for revenue per tran as we go into 2017. So we'll basically break that revenue per transaction out into some different metrics that actually makes some more sense. But the STP business, as you can imagine, because it is toll-based, individual transaction-based, is relatively low on a revenue per tran basis. 
Operator: Thank you. That's all the time we have for questions today. And with that, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2016 Q2  (2016-08-04 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the FleetCor Technologies, Inc. Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. 
 I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Eric Dey, Chief Financial Officer with FleetCor Technologies. Thank you. You may begin. 
Eric R. Dey: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. By now, everyone should have access to our second quarter press release. It can be found at www.fleetcor.com under the Investor Relations section.
 Throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than other companies' similarly titled non-GAAP information.
 Quantitative reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable information appears in today's press release and on our website as previously described. Also, we are providing 2016 guidance on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis with a reconciliation of the 2.
 Finally, before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements. This includes forward-looking statements about our 2016 guidance, new products and fee initiatives and expectations regarding business development and acquisitions. They are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore, you should not put undue reliance on them.
 These results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K and on our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the Security and Exchange Commission. Others are described in our annual report on Form 10-K. These documents are available on our website as previously discussed at www.sec.gov.
 With that out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay, Eric, thanks, and thanks to each of you for joining the call today. Upfront here, I plan to cover 3 subjects. First, I'll comment on our Q2 results. Second, I'll update you on our acquisition and business development progress. And lastly, I'll provide some updated 2016 full year guidance.
 Okay. So onto the quarter. So earlier, we reported Q2 revenue of $418 million and cash EPS of $1.56. So this represents 3% top line and 5% bottom line on a reported basis. On a macro neutral or like-for-like basis, organic revenue growth was 9% and cash EPS growth was 16%. So 9% top, 16% bottom, which would be spot on our organic growth targets.
 We did finally get a little bit of help from the macro environment. U.S. fuel prices averaged $2.31 for the quarter, which was a bit above our internal plan, and we got some recovery of the Brazilian reai in Q2, which strengthened quite a bit. So nice to finally see a little macro recovery for FleetCor.
 Unfortunately, our same-store revenues continued weak in the quarter, down approximately 2% versus the prior year. The weakness was concentrated in oil and gas, railroads, health care and then more generally, in the Brazilian and Russian economies.
 The growth drivers in the quarter were similar to what they've been. So first, great U.S. MasterCard quarter, again, up 27% on constant fuel prices. A healthy 9% CLC quarter, that's despite this ongoing softness from our large railroad accounts. 
 Terrific Comdata performance. Our 2 biggest businesses, North America Trucking and Corporate Payments, both double-digit growers in the quarter. And last, we did get some help from the Shell Europe outsourcing program, which continues to move forward.
 In terms of sales for the quarter, we had a very strong new bookings quarter, with bookings growing 18% over the prior year. That's on top of a 27% sales growth rate that we had in Q1. Inside of that, our Comdata Corporate Payments sales nearly doubled in the quarter, so it shows the demand for that product line.
 So look, in summary, a very good Q2, came in a bit above our internal plan and our previous guidance. And we saw, again, a bit of a lift, a bit of an improvement in the macro environment.
 Okay, let me transition over now to our acquisition and business development update. We've moved a couple of our major initiatives finally over the goal line, and we moved closer to completion of our STP deal. So starting with STP. We did receive formal CADE antitrust approval without restriction. That deal is now subject to a 15-day review period, which suggest the deal could close sometime later this month.
 STP's Q1 results, which were released publicly, show their revenue is up 11% for the quarter. So the business continues to perform quite well in a challenging environment. So as you can imagine, we're quite excited about the prospect of closing what will be the second largest transaction ever for FleetCor and continuing really the incredible success of this company. So we will keep you posted there. 
 Travelcard, second update. We closed the Travelcard acquisition on August 1. We bought that business from LeasePlan. And Travelcard is a pure kind of universal fuel card issuer based in the Netherlands. It goes to market through both leasing companies like LeasePlan and then directly to end clients. 
 And although it's relatively small, we see a number of upsides in owning it. One, that we could now market more aggressively to some of the other leasing companies now that Travelcard's ownership is separated from LeasePlan. Two, it's -- Travelcard has a network in Belgium, which is adjacent, which gives us an opportunity to expand. And then third, our plans call for stepping up investment in sales and marketing against the direct segment, which is something obviously in the FleetCor wheelhouse.
 But look, the primary motivation benefit of this transaction is entering another significant and promising European market. We set the goal to enter and build businesses in the top 5 Continental European markets, so this transaction gets us closer to that goal.
 Obviously, as we get positioned in these major European markets, it will better position us to win future European oil outsourcing deals and also give us a better platform to market our universal card.
 So Speedway, let me talk about Speedway. We are delighted to announce the signing of that new fuel card outsourcing contract. Couldn't be happier. So it was, of course, a competitive process, and we're just delighted that Speedway selected us to be their partner. For those of you that don't know, Speedway is actually the fifth-largest U.S. fuel retailer and has built a -- really a great commercial card following focusing on commercial. 
 Speedway will become the third-largest U.S. oil relationship that we have once that program is fully rolled out, and we're hopeful that we could begin conversion of that program as we get to the end of this year. So quite excited to start on that new relationship.
 Okay. Last, let me move over to guidance. So today, we're increasing our full year 2016 guidance from $6.53 to $6.68, so that's up $0.15. That does not include the expected contribution from STP of approximately $0.15 at the midpoint. That would bring our full year cash EPS estimates to $6.83. 
 So the bridge on this thing is $6.53 in our prior guidance plus a $0.03 Q2 beat, we're adding $0.06 for our rest of year higher fuel prices. We're adding $0.06 for early adoption of the new FASB stock option policy, which would get us to $6.68. Then assuming we close STP in August, we'd add another $0.15, which, again, will bring our total potential cash EPS estimate to $6.83. 
 So look, quite a bit better than the $6.50 guidance that we opened within February. So look, in summary, a good Q2, a bit better than we expected; 9% and 16% organic or like-for-like growth, again, right on our internal targets; 18% new sales growth in the quarter, very, very good business development months; increased certainty of the STP close with the CADE opinion; completion of the Travelcard acquisition; the new Speedway win. So all very good news. 
 And a full year guidance, that's a meaningful raise for us, partly the result of an improving economy. So we think this sets up well for a strong rest of year, and maybe more importantly, an improving 2017 outlook. 
 So with that, let me turn the call back over to Eric. He'll provide more detail on the quarter and on our guidance. Eric? 
Eric R. Dey: Thank you, Ron. For the second quarter of 2016, we reported revenue of $417.9 million, up 3% compared to the $404.6 million in the second quarter of 2015. The revenue from our North American segment increased 6% to $301.1 million from $284.6 million in the second quarter of 2015. 
 Revenue from our International segment decreased 3% to $116.8 million from $120 million in the second quarter of 2016. For the second quarter of 2016, GAAP net income increased 16% to $114.2 million or $1.21 per diluted share from $98.7 million or $1.05 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2015. 
 The other financial metrics that we routinely use are adjusted revenues and adjusted net income, which we sometimes also refer to as cash net income or cash EPS. Adjusted revenues equal our GAAP revenues less merchant commissions. We use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate the company's revenues net of the commissions that are paid to merchants who participate in certain card programs. 
 We prepare adjusted net income to eliminate the effects of noncash or nonrecurring items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance. A reconciliation of adjusted revenues and adjusted net income to GAAP numbers are provided in Exhibit 1 of our press release. 
 Adjusted revenues in the second quarter of 2016 were $395.6 million, up 3% compared to $382.9 million in the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted net income for the second quarter of 2016 increased 6% to $147.1 million or $1.56 per diluted share compared to $138.9 million or $1.48 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2015. 
 Included in the second quarter results was the impact of the macroeconomic environment, which continued to be unfavorable versus prior year-over-year. When we talk about the macroeconomic environment, we are referring to the impact that market fuel spread margins, fuel prices and foreign exchange rates can have on our business. 
 Changes in foreign exchange rates from the second quarter of 2015 were primarily negative, and overall, we believe negatively impacted revenue during the quarter by approximately $10 million. Fuel prices and spreads were also unfavorable during the quarter. And although we cannot precisely calculate the impact of these changes, we believe negatively impacted revenues by approximately $15 million. 
 In total, the impact of these changes negatively impacted our revenues by approximately $25 million in the second quarter and adjusted net income per diluted share by approximately $0.15. On a constant macro basis, organic revenues would have been up approximately 9% and adjusted net income per diluted share would have increased approximately 16%. 
 For the second quarter of 2016, transaction volumes increased 7% to 465 million transactions compared to 435.1 million transactions in the second quarter of 2015. North American segment transactions grew 6%, driven primarily by growth in the MasterCard, SVS and Corporate Payments businesses. 
 Transaction volumes in our International segment grew 17% and were primarily impacted by the addition of new Shell markets in 2015 and a small tuck-in acquisition in the first quarter of 2016. 
 For a discussion on revenue per transaction, we are going to exclude the impact of the SVS business, which had approximately 312.8 million transactions in the quarter at a very low revenue per transaction. Revenue per transaction for the second quarter of 2016, excluding the SVS business, decreased 6.9% to $2.50 from $2.68 in the second quarter of 2015. 
 Revenue per transaction can vary based on the geography, the relevant merchant and customer relationship, the payment product utilized and the types of products or services purchased. The revenue mix is influenced by our acquisitions, organic growth in the business and fluctuations in the macroeconomic environment. 
 Revenue per transaction, excluding SVS, decreased 1.5% in North America due primarily to the impact of lower fuel prices during the quarter and lower fuel spread margins versus prior year. And although we cannot precisely calculate the impact of these changes, we believe they negatively impacted our revenues by approximately $15 million in the second quarter. 
 On a constant macro basis, revenue per transaction in North America segment would have been approximately $2.82 versus $2.71 in 2015. In the international segment, our revenue per transaction decreased 17% due primarily to unfavorable foreign exchange rates in most of our geographies and the mix impact of a small tuck-in acquisition. 
 Foreign exchange rates impacted revenues unfavorably by approximately $10 million in the quarter. On a constant macro basis and excluding the small tuck-in acquisition, which add transactions at a very low revenue per transaction, revenue per transaction in the International segment would have been approximately $2.70 versus $2.63 in 2015. 
 Now let's shift over and discuss some other drivers of our second quarter performance. For our North American segment, most of our lines of business performed well, resulting in approximately 11% organic growth rate in the quarter at a constant fuel price spread and foreign exchange rate basis. 
 Some of the positive drivers in North America revenue during the quarter were similar to the last several quarters, including our MasterCard product, which had revenue growth of approximately 27% over the second quarter of 2015, assuming constant fuel prices and spreads. 
 The CLC Group, provider of our lodging card programs, had another solid quarter with 9% revenue growth over the second quarter of 2015. This revenue growth was driven primarily by increases in our CheckINN Direct product, which targets smaller accounts primarily offset by softness in some of our larger accounts that primarily do business in the oil and gas sector. 
 Our Comdata business performed well in the quarter. The trucking business was up about 10% in the quarter and the Corporate Payments business was up about 13%. Also our Pac Pride business continues to perform well with revenue up about 80% in the second quarter of 2016 versus the second quarter of 2015. 
 International segment revenue was down approximately 2.7% in the second quarter of 2016 versus the second quarter of 2015. This decrease was driven primarily by unfavorable foreign exchange rates in most geographies, which negatively impacted revenues by approximately $10 million in the quarter versus last year. 
 On a constant currency and fuel price basis, organic growth was approximately 5.4% for the second quarter. Results in our international business were positively impacted by the impact of the conversion of the Shell small business portfolio. 
 We are now in a total of 9 European markets with a plan to convert the remaining markets during the third quarter. On the downside, the economies in Brazil and Russia continue to struggle and are impacting revenues in those markets. 
 Now moving down the income statement. Total operating expenses for the second quarter were $246.7 million compared to $235.5 million in the second quarter of 2015, an increase of 4.8%. As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses increased slightly to 59% of revenue compared to 58.2% in the second quarter of 2015. 
 Included in operating expenses are merchant commissions, processing expenses, bad debt, selling and general administrative expense, depreciation and amortization expense and other operating net. 
 Included in the second quarter 2016 operating expense were favorable impacts resulting from foreign exchange rates being down in most of our foreign businesses, which resulted in an approximately $5 million favorable impact on expenses. 
 Also stock-based compensation expense in the second quarter of 2016 was $17.6 million compared to $14.3 million in the second quarter of 2015. Credit losses were $6.9 million for the quarter or 5 basis points compared to $4.9 million or 3 basis points in the second quarter of 2015. 
 The increase in bad debt was primarily due to bad debt that comes with the new euroShell business and normal quarterly fluctuations in some of our other businesses in the quarter. 
 Interest expense decreased 12% to $15.9 million in the second quarter of 2016 from $18.1 million in the second quarter of 2015. The decrease in interest expense was due primarily to the impact of delevering over the last year. Equity method investment increased to income of $7.2 million in the second quarter of 2016 from a loss of $5.1 million in the second quarter of 2015. 
 The increase in income was primarily due to an approximately $10 million onetime net recovery of purchase price from the sellers of the business. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2016 was 29.7% compared to 32.1% for the second quarter of 2015. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a onetime recovery of purchase price from our equity method investment that favorably impacted pretax earnings, but was not subject to income taxes. 
 In addition, the impact of tax planning initiatives that were implemented late in 2015 favorably impacted our tax rate. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $649 million in total cash. Approximately $156 million is restricted and consists of primarily customer deposits. 
 As of June 30, 2016, we had approximately $1,869,000,000 outstanding on our Term A loan, $246 million outstanding on our Term B loan and $10 million drawn on our revolver, leaving approximately $1,025,000,000 of undrawn availability. We had approximately $713 million borrowed against our securitization facility. 
 In addition, we have secured up to an additional $600 million in new Term Loan A by using the accordion feature in our existing term loan facility. The additional Term Loan A will be used to help finance the STP acquisition and for general working capital purposes. 
 We expect to draw the additional term loan in conjunction with the closing of STP and expect the rate to be approximately LIBOR plus 175 basis points at time of closing. 
 As of June 30, 2016, our leverage ratio was 2.2x EBITDA, which is well below our covenant level of 4x EBITDA as calculated under our credit agreement. We intend to use our excess cash flow to temporarily pay down the balance on our revolving credit facility and securitization facility and maintain liquidity for acquisitions and other corporate purposes. 
 To remind everyone, on February 4, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase of up to $500 million of FleetCor's common stock during an 18-month period ending August 1, 2017. To-date, the company has repurchased approximately 259,000 shares of stock for a total purchase price of approximately $36 million, with $26 million being purchased in the second quarter and the remainder being purchased in July. 
 And finally, we are not a capital-intensive business, and we spent approximately $13 million on CapEx during the second quarter of 2016. 
 Now on to our outlook for the remainder of 2016. Before I begin our discussion on guidance, I want to update you on our latest thinking about the macroeconomic environment. Foreign exchange rate movements have been a bit mixed lately with Brazil mostly favorable, but the U.K. pound trending lower due to Brexit. 
 So in total, we believe that FX rate will be mostly neutral over the balance of the year versus the guidance we've previously provided. In addition, we believe market spreads margins will be worse than last year by approximately $10 million and mostly in line with our prior guidance. 
 And finally, fuel prices have continued to trend favorably since the last earnings call. And as a result, we have updated our guidance to reflect the higher fuel prices. For the balance of the year, we believe fuel prices could favorably impact our results by $0.05 to $0.07 in adjusted net income per diluted share. 
 Versus prior year, the macroeconomic environment guidance assumptions create approximately a $28 million revenue headwind and approximately a $0.15 cash EPS headwind for the rest of year versus the same period in 2015. That being said, our financial guidance is as follows: total revenues to be between $1,740,000,000 and $1,780,000,000, GAAP net income to be between $475 million and $486 million, GAAP net income per diluted share between $5.02 and $5.12; adjusted net income to be between $627 million and $640 million and adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $6.61 and $6.75 or $6.68 at the midpoint. 
 Some of the assumptions we have made in preparing this guidance include the following: weighted average fuel price of $2.31 for the second half of the year equal to the second quarter of 2016; market spreads returning to more historical levels for the rest of 2016, but down approximately $10 million versus 2015; foreign exchange rates equal to the 7-day average ended July 13, 2016, the SVS business is retained for all of 2016; expected early adoption of the new accounting rules for stock options effective in this third quarter; the impact is projected to lower our effective tax rate for the balance of the year, and we believed will impact gap and adjusted net income per diluted share positively by approximately $0.05 to $0.07 per share; the favorable impact assumes a normal level of stock option exercises over the balance of the year; continued weakness in our company's Russian and Brazilian businesses; a full year tax rate of approximately 30%; fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately 95 million shares; the Travelcard acquisition in the Netherlands that Ron discussed earlier, although strategic in nature, will be immaterial to both revenue and earnings over the balance of the year; and no impact related to the STP acquisitions or the new Speedway partnership agreement.
 As Ron stated earlier on the call, we have received unconditional regulatory approval from CADE for STP acquisition in Brazil. As a result, we may have upside to our guidance in the range of $0.14 to $0.16 in adjusted net income per diluted share if we close STP as expected in the third quarter. 
 Also, we expect to start the conversion of our new Speedway partnership agreement by year-end and we will include the impact related to this agreement in the 2017 guidance. 
 And with that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] First question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. 
David Togut: Nice to see the pickup in CLC revenue growth, 9%, up from 7% in Q1. Could you talk about the drivers that led to the acceleration in growth at CLC? And how will you expect CLC to perform for the balance of the year? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, David, it's Ron. It's the same tale of 2 cities, right? So the large account business there continues to be a bit of a drag. The top 4 or 5 accounts that are railroad accounts are still 20% to 25% down from a year ago. So what that does is bring down the growth rate of the SME piece, which is in the 20%-plus range, down to this 9% or 10%. So basically, I think, going forward, as we lap the big account business, the growth rate should keep picking up. 
David Togut: That's encouraging to hear. Just shifting gears over to AllStar in the U.K., last quarter you talked about a transition towards the Visa chip card program. What was the growth in AllStar like in terms of revenue in the quarter and how would you see that progressing? 
Ronald F. Clarke: I'd say we're probably more disappointing. And I think I could literally restate, David, what I said last quarter. So better, I think, it picked up a point or 2 from last quarter, but we're still trying to do 2 things there. One, move the rest of the base over to this new product, which we call AllStar 1, that we have better economics. And then 2, train the users how to use the card at the point of sale, which gives them cents off and gives us better economics, so those are still 2 priorities. If we get that done, which the plan is to get it done in the second half then those numbers will start to pick up. 
David Togut: Got it. And then if you could update us on the contribution to transaction revenue from the Uber account, if you could give us a sense of how rapidly you expect that to ramp in the back half of this year and '17? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I mean, it's still from a volume perspective, growing like a weed sequentially, so every quarter that we look, it's up significantly versus the prior year. We think it will still grow. Uber has indicated some interest in maybe expanding the driver pool that they offer the program to because the feedback has been so positive, and we continue in discussions about the idea of maybe offering it beyond the U.S. So I would say those are the couple upsides to really continue growth next year. But with that said, remember it's not a big revenue per tran kind of account for us, so although it delivers a lot of volume, it delivers a lot less than line average revenue. 
David Togut: Got it. Quick final question for me. If you could update us on the pipeline in Europe, particularly with the big oils and any insight you have into Shell? I noticed that WEX announced a prepaid card deal with Shell in Europe and Asia. You have the SME business in Europe. If you could update us on how you see Shell progressing and maybe the broader landscape with the big European oils? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, that's a good question. So I'd say on Shell, the good news is, we're coming to the conclusion of this Shell Europe outsourcing program, so the original idea was to convert 12 or 13 of their markets. They ended up selling off a market so the total ended up being 11. We're actually live in 9 of the 11 and plan late this month, so before August is over, to be in the remaining 2. So call it by September we'll have completed the entire conversion of that program in what, 2 to 2.5 years from contract signing, Eric, somewhere in that range. So I'd say, David, that's the good news and we've done a good job getting the thing over. And if we perform well, right, both in terms of the technology conversions, which we have, the service level and probably most importantly, the sales of new business, my guess is, they'll probably throw more our way, but they'll want to see their performance first. So I'd say that, that's a subject to revisit probably next year. In terms of beyond Shell, I think, I mentioned in our prior call that there were a couple of major oil RFPs. Hopefully, we'll take the mystery out of one of those, which we announced earlier, which leads. There's still a decision we believe to be made this fall by another company. So I'd say that's the status kind of 1 significant thing still to be decided. 
Operator: The next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Jefferies. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Was the Speedway win, was that a competitive takeaway or were they doing it in house prior? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Ramsey, it's Ron. So I guess the answer is both. So yes, they were doing it internally and yes, it was a competitive process among outsourcers. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay, okay. And then I know it's a small part of your business, but Pac Pride revenue is up 80%, I mean, that's a big number. What are the drivers there? How did you guys enter that? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, again, I think the short story, when we bought that, is kind of copying the playbook from CFN. So the 2 companies that are in kind of this card lock business, CFN and Pac Pride, we proved that by offering an extended network, a more convenient network to these kind of private label cardholders that they would you sometimes the convenient network, if you will. And then in the CFN case, they use a kind of, I don't know, 20% of the time. And so we did the same thing with Pac Pride. We reengineered the cards so that it could work beyond the 1,500 or so Pac Pride locations and work in a network of an additional call it 30,000 locations. So as the transactions grow in the convenience network, so do our revenues. So we expect that business to continue to grow for the foreseeable future. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. Lastly, from me, you've spoken about this in the past, but can you remind us what are the revenue synergy opportunities with STP? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Well, there are all kinds. I mean, the most obvious one for us would be both cross-selling of the client base and utilization of their sales force. So again, they've got call it 100,000 business clients. So when we look at those, the overlap against our own fuel card and food card business is pretty small. So the first thing we would do is, obviously, talk to the existing STP corporate accounts and offer up the other FleetCor products. And then the second one is, they have a field sales group for both consumer and business of about 1,500 people, both field people and people located like in mall kiosks and stuff. Same idea, it's kind of a single product selling machine today, selling kind of electronic toll. So the idea would be to take some select set of people and locations and again start to offer the rest of the FleetCor product line. So I'd say those are the 2 kind of obvious marketing and sales ideas. 
Ramsey El-Assal: And is any of that contemplated in your accretion guidance? 
Ronald F. Clarke: It's not. 
Operator: The next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. 
James Schneider: I was wondering if you separately from the outsourcing deals that you mentioned, can you maybe talk about portfolio sales and whether you see any more asset availability in the market and potential pricing for those assets relative to what you are willing to pay? 
Ronald F. Clarke: I'm not sure, Jim. Say the question again, I'm not sure I got it. 
James Schneider: In terms of the potential portfolio of sales rather than outsourcing... 
Ronald F. Clarke: What does that mean portfolio? Oh, you're saying like the Shell example? 
James Schneider: Correct. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, okay. Is there an opportunity for more of those? 
James Schneider: Yes. And do you see any more of those assets kind of on the horizon and kind of what are you thinking about the valuation levels that you're seeing in the market? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, so the short answer is, yes. In fact, that's really in essence what the Speedway transaction is. It looks really identical structurally to the Shell outsourcing deal. So I think that's a model that the oil companies are starting to move to. And yes, some of the additional RFPs and interest that's out there in the marketplace is of that same variety. 
James Schneider: Fair enough. And then you mentioned corporate payments up 13% in that Comdata business. Obviously, you've seen some health care headwinds there, but you've also mentioned about the doubling in the sales. So can you maybe talk about how long dated that backlog is? And what you think a normalized growth rate might be in that business as we get a little further out a year or 18 months in the future? 
Ronald F. Clarke: That's a great question. So the first off is, we've lapped the health care surprise we had whatever a year ago. So that health care segment is fundamentally stable or flat now. So fundamentally the rest of our corporate payments business is, obviously, growing faster than 13%, so that's good news. Two, as I mentioned, we doubled sales. We doubled fundamentally the headcount in that business from when we bought it, people selling corporate payments and the install cycle on that is way longer than fuel cards. I'd say in our models think 6 to 12 months maybe a peg, Jim, other thing might be 9. So if we made sales in Q2, think of that converting fully to revenue call it 3 quarters later. So your last question, stock question was growth rates. So hey, we posted 13% now, which is faster without the health care business. So I would say, again, it's fundamentally a function of our investment, but I would say that should be accelerating certainly into the high teens as we move through the year and into next year. And I think it's a function of how much we elect to invest in 2017. But again, when you double the sales of something we've it said before, it's an early stage big opportunity that's really just a function of marketing investment and implementation investment, a lot of demand for the product. 
James Schneider: That's helpful. And then just lastly, just on the same-store sales down 2% a little softer than Q1. I think it was down 1%. Can you maybe talk about any leading indicators you're watching to see whether that business could be inflecting or improving in terms of a global basis? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, again, it's tough, Jim, because it's really incredibly pocketed. So if you looked across all of our segments that add up to that minus 2, 75% of our clients are flat to up. So you'd be like well, that seems great. But there were a few verticals like the railroads or oil and gas that are way down, right, 20%, 25% kind of down. And then you've got these 2 markets, Brazil and Russia, which albeit small, again, are way down. Softness levels in literally in the 10% to 15% range across all their clients. And so it's those kinds of crummy economies or crummy verticals that are bringing the line average kind of below the waterline. So I don't know if we have a good guess on either of those when either those verticals in the U.S. will recover or frankly when those 2 economies will recover. Well, your guess is as good as ours. 
Operator: The next question comes from Darrin Peller with Barclays. 
Darrin Peller: I know I've asked this before, but could you just touch further down the runway around the MasterCard product. Just any reason why that may or may not continue at this pace? And then I just want to follow-up with a couple -- one other one. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Dan, hey, it's Ron. I'd say, again, I think, we said this in the last quarter, we would see that the growth rates that we've shown in Q1 and Q2 will go down. The main reason is, again, there's some fair amount of price that we put into that product line a year or plus ago to combat the headwinds that we  had. So that will decelerate as we lap some of that pricing. And there's, obviously, some amount of Uber helping us in there as well. But I'd say the main driver is just again sales investment that product of kind of all our products is the product like for everybody, little accounts with 5 cards like because it's convenient, joint accounts because it works everywhere and it's controlled like it. And so unlike some of our other products, you can sell it in every geography to every segment. And so I guess we like the prospects of kind of double-digit for as long as we can see assuming we can keep investing enough in sales, right, as the base keeps getting bigger. 
Darrin Peller: Even with the anniversary of those price changes which I'm assuming is second half this year, is still going to be well into the double-digit in your view? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I'm not sure I've actually looked at that product line in the forecast in and of itself. So I would say probably, but it will step down as we anniversary this pricing, which, I think, begins this quarter in Q3. But again, it's an incredibly healthy, it's an incredibly healthy in-demand product. 
Darrin Peller: Yes. And then just on the Speedway announcement, I know you mentioned you'd give us an update for '17, but can give us any preliminary thoughts on the sort of magnitude or materiality of that? 
Ronald F. Clarke: We've got to be a little careful, right, because the client is sensitive. So I try to guide you a little bit with their size as a business. So like their #5 so you can obviously name like Shell, Exxon, BP, Chevron, the 4 biggest oil companies. So they're behind them. And then 2, they've got a really strong commercial card business. And then the comment that they'll be the third largest, they've got 8 or 9 different oil company portfolios in our North America business, they'll be #3. So I'd say it's a meaningful, it was kind of a portfolio acquisition and outsourcing agreement. So it’s kind of full value chain. So it's meaningful for a couple of the reasons. One, it will contribute. You'll see it in our guidance next year. But 2, I think, for us, it's just really reaffirming, right? As the game plays, we get the call and so for us, as more of these come up, to try to win our fair share, it feels pretty good. 
Darrin Peller: Just last question. I know that, you're just about barely to close the STP deal. But with that in mind, I mean, how far off do you think we are from the next bigger acquisition of meaningful size? 
Ronald F. Clarke: You know we're like always in some conversations, but I'd say that over the next 6 months, Darrin, we're going to really focus on eating that. It is a big, big financial business and a massive set of assets business for us. And so we've got pretty bold integration plans. So starting with myself, I put a large group of people plus some outside consulting people, we're going to spend a lot of time trying to get that trajectory to stay great. So I'd say that short-term, call it next 6 months that will be a big part of our focus. And then second, I don't know if Eric mentioned it, but kind of pro forma STP we're going to get into the low 3s at the close. So call it 3 2, just to pick a number. And so I think we told you that we want to run this company kind of around 3. We might spike up temporarily for the right kind of assets. So I'd say that we're not full, we still have liquidity. We've still got an accordion in this new facility. So we're staying out there, but I'd say it's not our highest priority to go get another $1 billion deal over the next 6 months. 
Operator: The next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Congrats on the Speedway. Just a follow-up on Darrin's question. Just the [indiscernible] shows its actually a top 4 fleet issuers. So is this just an outsourcing contract, guys? And how much growth potential do you see for the portfolio to grow either organically or by you doing more with the accounts? 
Ronald F. Clarke: You want Speedway, Tien-tsin? 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Yes, Speedway. Sorry. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I mean -- I'd say, a lot, right? So we, obviously, have the fact base of how Speedway ran the thing and how they invested and how they priced the thing and did all the different things. So I'd say that our investment and channels that we have, the ability to use, for example, websites that have 6 or 8 products on it is an advantage that a clearinghouse company like us has, that an independent, a single brand can't do. And our investment with hundreds, hundreds of people in card telesales. They've had more of a field groups. So I'd say that the investment that we plan to make in sales and marketing is behind really a great brand that they've got great locations kind of in this Midwest footprint. We think we'll step that up a lot. And then B, they're squarely opportunities around how we package and price different parts of it. So I'd say that we're quite bullish on the revenue growth potential there. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Okay. Good to know. And then I think new sales up 18%, does that include Speedway? 
Ronald F. Clarke: No, because again, we haven't converted it. We've only both signed the contract, Tien-tsin, so, no. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Okay. A bigger question there was -- because I get the question a lot. How does the 18 and the 27 in the first quarter in terms of bookings, how does -- how can we use that figure to translate that into revenue next year? Is there the rule of thumb of any sort? Obviously, it's a big number, but just trying to contextualize that for. 
Ronald F. Clarke: No, again, I think, we've laid this out before. The math that you really need is the relationship of new to the base, right? So if the base of our company were call it $2 billion and we told you we were selling 20% or something, we told you, hey, we're selling $400 million, and we told you what we are losing, you could kind of model revenue. What, I think, we're trying to do with the sale thing that we're disclosing here is to give you guys a sense of sales investments that we're making. I think, we told them what $20 million to $25 million, Eric, incremental this year? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes. Told them that. 
Ronald F. Clarke: So we're growing sales, Tien-tsin, almost as fast. If you take the first and second quarter, I think, we're 20% or something through the first half up, so where the first headline is, we are selling more, right, than we were in the prior year. And then the second one, which, I think, is good for investors is, it's the single best indicator of health, right, if you can sell a card program in July of 2016 then your offers are relevant. And so we call out sales to let people know, people still that are making decisions like the product line that we have in the market today, we're not living off of the past. So those are the couple of the reasons for the disclosure. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Understood. Just one more, just the STP. I think, you said $0.15 accretive now. I thought it was $0.10 before. Did something change or did I just have it wrong? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, it's the FX. I don't have it in front of me, but I think we guided in March when we announced I believe kind of $0.10 to $0.13 was the range. And so if you take the FX, which was just under 4, I think, it was 3 9. I think we use 3 23 if I recall last week to model that so the range has just moved up to whatever, 13 to 17 call it from 10 to 13. So it's up kind of $0.03 or $0.04 really on FX. But the business is kind of where we thought, I disclosed what's out there publicly on the company. When you think about a company in that economy with that kind of softness, that I called out growing revenues 11% in the first quarter. But the thing is just powering through a pretty tough place. And so what we haven't really taken up their core forecast for the balance of the year just really made the FX adjustment. 
Operator: The next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. 
Ashish Sabadra: My question was on the SVS. SVS also grew pretty solid this quarter, if I back in the number I get more like 17%. And I thought this was more like a low single-digit grower. So I was just wondering if you can confirm my numbers were right and what's driving the growth there? 
Eric R. Dey: Ashish, this is Eric. You're in the ballpark. To correct, SVS had a very good quarter. There is, obviously, a lot of seasonality to the gift card business and effectively what happened in Q2 was, there were some card purchases that would normally have taken place in the third quarter that were actually accelerated into the second quarter, which kind of drove the growth in the second quarter. Unfortunately, that will probably impact the growth of that business in the second half of the year. 
Ashish Sabadra: No, that's great. And then once we have STP, post STP, the way -- the STP you said grew organically 11% and so once we have that in the numbers, the pro forma international growth that should go not -- is that a way to think about it that we could see that go more into the high single or even low teens, like international growth? 
Eric R. Dey: Are you talking about organic growth as a whole, Ashish? 
Ashish Sabadra: Yes, including -- assuming STP you had in the prior year, so the perform organic growth for the international business. 
Eric R. Dey: Yes, I mean, I don't know. I mean, again, I think, the international business right now growing organically on a constant macro basis probably in the mid-single digits. This is, obviously, a meaningful acquisition for us. But it may take some time. Obviously, we are going to spend time integrating the business over the next 12 months kind of as Ron indicated. And obviously, we want to maintain that certainly that double-digit growth into the foreseeable future so we're going to try and do that. Whether that the mix impacted that translates to kind of double-digit is who knows, we want to get to the budget cycle before we can make a judgment on that. 
Operator: The next question comes from Oscar Turner with SunTrust. 
Oscar Turner: So you mentioned corporate payments revenue was up 13% and bookings nearly doubling. Can you talk about, which verticals are driving this growth? And that also, how much of this growth is being driven by new customers? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Sure. It's Ron. I'd say that the construction vertical is gangbusters for us and was a big part of the sale that I called out for Q2. So I'd say, there are 2 or 3 verticals that we target that, that would be the leadings for Q2. 
Oscar Turner: Okay. And also just, is all of that growth being driven by new customers? 
Ronald F. Clarke: You mean versus kind of same-store, the existing accounts growing? 
Oscar Turner: Correct. Correct. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. As I mentioned, the health care thing is probably a little bit soft. So, yes, the corporate payments growth is fundamentally just adding more spend from new accounts. 
Oscar Turner: Okay. And then also you have great growth across a number of products like you mentioned MasterCard up mid-20% range; CLC up, 9%; Pac Pride, 80%; Comdata, I think, like low to mid double digits. Could you help us understand how fast the close loop fuel products are growing to get us to the 9% constant macro growth rate? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I don't think we think about the world in terms of closed loop because in a bunch of markets we'd have products that are "both". But I guess what I would say is, yes, we've tried to call out some of the businesses that are growing so you guys can see how the consolidated number is at 9. I guess I'd answer it a bit different way that we have still a set of businesses, particularly the ones in Brazil and Russia that are still going backwards. And we have some other businesses we called out before like check that's inching forward now and our Fuelman business, which is an old U.S. business kind of inching forward. So we have 3 or 4 businesses that are either kind of flattish because they are mature or the economies are crummy like Brazil and Russia, which were supposed to be when we did those transactions. BRIC markets, that we're going to grow double digits. So I'd say that's the contributor that's causing the consolidated number to be 9. 
Operator: This concludes the time allocated for questions on today's call. This also concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines. We want to thank you for participating, and hope you have a pleasant day.

===== 2016 Q1  (2016-05-04 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the FleetCor Technologies, Inc. First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Eric Dey, Chief Financial Officer with FleetCor Technologies, Inc. Thank you. You may begin. 
Eric R. Dey: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. By now, everyone should have access to our first quarter press release. It can be found at www.fleetcor.com under the Investor Relations section.
 Throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than other companies' similarly titled non-GAAP information. Quantitative reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable information appears in today's press release and on our website, as previously described. Also, we are providing 2016 guidance on a non-GAAP basis.
 Finally, before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements. This includes forward-looking statements about our 2016 guidance, new products and fee initiatives and expectations regarding business development and acquisitions. They are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore, you should not put undue reliance on them. These results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K filed with the Security and Exchange Commission. Others are described in our annual report on Form 10-K. These documents are available on our website, as previously discussed, and at www.sec.gov.
 With that out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Eric, thanks, and thanks to each of you for joining the call today. Up front here, I plan to cover 3 subjects: first, I'll comment on our Q1 results; second, I'll discuss our 2016 guidance; and finally, I'll update you on our company's strategic progress.
 Okay. So on to the quarter. We're delighted to report Q1 revenue of $414 million versus $416 million last year, so essentially flat. We reported Q1 cash EPS of $1.53. That's versus $1.45 last year, so up 6%. So that earnings result is a bit better than our guidance.
 On a macro neutral basis, that is adjusted for fuel price, fuel spreads and FX, revenues actually grew 10%. That's excluding SVS. And cash EPS grew 20%. So growth of 10% on the top and 20% on the bottom on a constant macro basis. We called the macro environment right for the quarter. Fuel prices and FX came in virtually on our plan. Fuel spreads were a bit worse than planned because fuel prices started to rise in mid-March but basically as we planned.
 There were 5 primary drivers of growth in Q1. So first, the MasterCard business. A great quarter. Volume was up 17%, helped by Uber. And revenue was up 48% on a constant macro basis for the quarter. So that product continues to have legs.
 Second, Comdata was solid. Comdata trucking fuel card business up 11% in the quarter and corporate payments business up 13%, excluding health care. So a good Comdata quarter.
 Pac Pride, a business we acquired about 1.5 year ago, doubled revenue in the quarter versus last year. A good result.
 The Shell Europe outsourcing business was up 150% for the quarter, mostly due to the rollout of additional markets. So a lot of help from Shell.
 And then lastly, we enjoyed lower interest expense as we delevered and a lower tax rate than last year, both of those adding to our earnings growth.
 Sales. We had a really good sales result in Q1. Our new sales booking dollars, the way we look at new business was up 27% versus the prior year. Increases really across the board. New sales are the best indicator of market demand or market receptivity for our products. So it suggests our offerings continue to be quite relevant.
 So look, in summary, for the quarter, we're basically out of the blocks here where we expect expected to be. We're delighted to see Comdata in double-digit territory, happy to see the macro environment trending up at the end of the quarter and pleased with our underlying growth fundamentals staying around the 10% mark for the quarter.
 Okay. Let me transition now over to our 2016 guidance. We're revising full year guidance today to $6.53 in cash EPS at the midpoint. That reflects the $0.03 beat we had in the first quarter. We're keeping our rest of year guidance intact for now despite the fact that fuel prices and FX have improved in recent weeks. The trend is quite short. So we're not prepared to extend those current levels to the full year. We'll look to make adjustments as we see more data. Obviously, there's upside to the $6.53 full year cash EPS guidance, probably in the range of $0.20 to $0.25, if macro factors were to continue to hold where they are today and we complete the STP acquisition in Q3. So some upside there.
 Okay. Let me shift gears and provide a bit of an update on FleetCor's overall strategic progress. So first off, number one, our portfolio, that's the product lines and the geographies that we serve. So we signed STP, the Brazil toll company, deal in Q1. That put FleetCor into a new category, electronic toll payments. And the Shell Europe outsourcing deal has helped us enter 7 new European markets, bringing our total markets served to 12 of the world's top 20. So now actively in -- generating business in 12 of the world's top 20 markets. So as we continue to extend our market potential, that extends the company's opportunity to grow as we enter these new product categories and serve yet new geographies. We clearly like the diversification and the added ratability that it brings.
 Second, our build strategy organic growth. We continue to make investments in organic growth. Our 2016 plan calls for $15 million of additional sales and marketing spend, along with the addition of 250 salespeople. We're also going live testing outsourced telesales. We're doing that both in our Comdata corporate payments business and a couple of our European businesses, looking for new ways to scale sales faster.
 We're busy testing lots of new products. First off, BuilderPro, it's a purchasing card for the construction industry. It lets clients buy fuel and construction supplies in a controlled manner. We're reselling Kabbage lending products to our existing clients to further leverage our client relationships. We're live with our Comdata hotel card program. That's a rebranding of our CLC program but targeted to Comdata trucking clients who are big users of midpriced hotel rooms. And we're also bundling something called fuel tax compliance along with our new Comdata trucking card sales. And we're getting over half of the new accounts to take that bundle. So the summary is we're working hard to keep our products fresh everywhere.
 Third, partner strategy. We've reorganized our partner group to put even more pressure against our global partner business. That focus has resulted in a number of new partner wins over the last couple of years, including 2 new relationships in Canada. So although it's been slow, we remain very bullish on the long-term partner opportunity. We're actively chasing a couple of partner RFPs right now and expecting decisions sometime here in 2016. So still believe in the upside there.
 And fourth area, acquisitions. We announced the $1 billion acquisition of STP in March. We started our planning work for that business and hoping to get antitrust approval in Q3, along with continuing to work on a couple of additional acquisition targets.
 So overall, we're making good strategic progress. We're expanding our portfolio and the opportunities at which we play. We're investing in more sales. We're investing in more new products. We're winning new partners. We're signing up new deals. We're continuing the build, buy and partner strategy we outlined 5 years ago when we went public, and it's working.
 So with that, let me turn the call back over to Eric. He'll provide some additional detail on the quarter and our outlook. Eric? 
Eric R. Dey: For the first quarter of 2016, we reported revenue of $414.3 million, relatively flat to the $416.2 million in the first quarter of 2015. The revenue from our North American segment increased 1.6% to $303.5 million from $298.8 million in the first quarter of 2016. Revenue from our International segment was down 5.7% to $110.7 million from $117.4 million in the first quarter of 2016.
 For the first quarter of 2016, GAAP net income increased 16.8% to $110 million or $1.17 per diluted share from $94.2 million or $1 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2015.
 The other financial metrics that we routinely use are adjusted revenues and adjusted net income, which we sometimes also refer to as cash net income or cash EPS. Adjusted revenues equal our GAAP revenues less merchant commissions. We use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate the company's revenues, net of the commissions that are paid to merchants who participate in certain card programs. We prepare adjusted net income to eliminate the effects of noncash items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance. A reconciliation of adjusted revenues and adjusted net income to GAAP numbers are provided in Exhibit 1 of our press release.
 Adjusted revenues in the first quarter of 2016 of $386 million were relatively flat compared to $388.8 million in the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted net income for the first quarter of 2016 increased 6% to $144.3 million or $1.53 per diluted share compared to $135.9 million or $1.45 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2015.
 Included in the first quarter results was the impact of the macroeconomic environment, which continued to be unfavorable versus the prior year. When we talk about the macroeconomic environment, we are referring to the impact that market fuel spread margins, fuel prices and foreign exchange rates can have on our business. Changes in foreign exchange rates were unfavorable in most geographies for the quarter and overall, we believe, negatively impacted revenue during the quarter by approximately $13 million. Fuel prices and spreads were also unfavorable during the quarter and although we cannot precisely calculate the impact of these changes, we believe, negatively impacted revenues by approximately $25 million.
 In total, the impact of these changes negatively impacted our revenues by approximately $38 million in the first quarter and adjusted net income per diluted share by approximately $0.21. On a constant macro basis, revenues would have been up approximately 9% and adjusted net income per diluted share would have been up approximately 20%. 
 For the first quarter of 2016, transaction volumes increased 13% to 487 million transactions compared to 431.3 million transactions in the first quarter of 2015. North American segment transactions grew 13%, driven primarily by growth in the MasterCard and SVS businesses. Transaction volumes in our International segment grew 12% and were primary impacted by the addition of new Shell markets in 2015 and a small tuck-in acquisition in the first quarter of 2016.
 For discussion on revenue per transaction, we are going to exclude the impact of the SVS business, which had approximately 342 million transactions in the quarter at a very low revenue per transaction. Revenue per transaction for the first quarter of 2016, excluding the SVS business, decreased 10.6% to $2.56 from $2.87 in the first quarter of 2015. Revenue per transaction can vary based on the geography, the relevant merchant and customer relationship, the payment product utilized and the types of products or services purchased. The revenue mix is influenced by our acquisitions, organic growth in the business and fluctuations in the macroeconomic environment.
 Revenue per transaction, excluding SVS, decreased 8% in North American due primarily to the impact of lower fuel prices during the quarter and lower fuel spread margins versus prior year. And although we cannot precisely calculate the impact of these changes, we believe they negatively impacted our revenues by approximately $24 million in the first quarter. On a constant macro basis, revenue per transaction in North America segment would have been approximately $3.09 versus $3.07 in 2015.
 In the International segment, revenue per transaction decreased 16% due primarily to unfavorable foreign exchange rates in most of our geographies. Foreign exchange rates impacted revenues unfavorably by approximately $13 million in the quarter. On a constant macro basis and excluding the small tuck-in acquisition, which had transactions at a very low revenue per transaction, revenue per transaction in the International segment would have been approximately $2.72 versus $2.51 in 2015.
 Now let's shift over and discuss some other drivers of our first quarter performance. For our North American segment, most of our lines of business performed well, resulting in approximately 10% organic growth rate in the quarter at a constant fuel price spread and foreign exchange rate basis. Some of the positive drivers in North America revenue during the quarter were similar to the last several quarters, including the exceptional performance of our MasterCard product, which had revenue growth of approximately 48% over the first quarter of 2015, assuming constant fuel prices.
 The CLC Group, provider of our lodging card programs, had another solid quarter with 7% revenue growth over the first quarter of 2015. This revenue growth was driven primarily by increase in our CheckINN Direct product, which targets smaller accounts, partially offset by softness in some of our larger accounts that primarily do business in the oil and gas sector.
 Our Comdata business performed well in the quarter. The trucking business was up about 11% in the quarter, and growth in the corporate payment business was also up 13%, excluding health care.
 Our Pac Pride business is off to a great start, and we have already nearly doubled the revenue of the business since we acquired it in 2014.
 International segment revenue was down approximately 6% in the first quarter of 2016 versus the first quarter of 2015. This decrease was driven primarily by unfavorable foreign exchange rates in most geographies, which negatively impacted revenues by approximately $13 million in the quarter versus last year. On a constant currency and fuel price basis, organic growth was approximately 6% for the first quarter.
 Results in our International business were impacted by the continued conversion of the Shell's small business portfolio. We are now in a total of 7 markets with a plan to convert the remaining markets during the remainder of 2016. On the downside, the economies in Brazil and Russia continue to struggle and are impacting revenues in those markets.
 Now moving down the income statement. Total operating expenses for the first quarter were $238.3 million compared to $252.4 million in the first quarter of 2015, a decrease of 5.6%. As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses decreased to 57.5% of revenue compared to 60.6% in the first quarter of 2015. Included in operating expenses are merchant commissions, processing expenses, bad debt, selling and general administrative expense, depreciation and amortization expense and other operating net. Included in the first quarter 2016 operating expense were favorable impacts resulting from foreign exchange rates being down in most of our foreign businesses, which resulted in an approximately $10 million favorable adjustment to amortization and a $6 million adjustment in other expense lines.
 Also, stock-based compensation expense in the first quarter of 2016 was $15.9 million compared to $17.7 million in the first quarter of 2015.
 Credit losses were $6.8 million for the quarter compared to $8.1 million in the first quarter of 2015. The decrease in bad debt was primarily due to  lower bad debt in some of our U.S. businesses in the quarter.
 Interest expense decreased 17% to $16.2 million in the first quarter of 2016 from $19.6 million in the first quarter of 2015. The decrease in interest expense was due primarily to the impact of delevering from the first quarter of 2015 through the first quarter of 2016.
 Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2016 was 29.9% compared to 32.6% for the first quarter of 2015. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to certain favorable discrete items booked in the first quarter of 2016 of approximately $3 million and an overall lower tax rate related to tax planning initiatives that were implemented late in 2015. The 2016 tax benefit booked in the first quarter related to tax planning initiatives was approximately $1.2 million.
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $545 million in total cash, approximately $145 million of which are restricted and are primarily customer deposits.
 As of March 31, 2016, we had approximately $1,894,000,000 outstanding on our Term A loan, $247 million outstanding on our Term B loan and $90 million drawn on our revolver, leaving approximately $945 million of undrawn availability. We had approximately $551 million borrowed against our securitization facility.
 As of March 31, 2016, our leverage ratio was 2.35x EBITDA, which is well below our covenant level of 4x EBITDA. We intend to use our free cash flow to temporarily pay down the balance on our revolving credit facility and securitization facility and maintain liquidity for acquisitions and other corporate purposes.
 To remind everyone, on February 4, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase of up to $500 million of FleetCor's common stock during an 18-month period ending August 1, 2017. During the first quarter of 2016, the company did not repurchase any stock as our trading window did not open due to the impending announcement of the STP transaction. Our intention is to implement a 10b5-1 share buyback plan when the window opens in the next few weeks. There is no guarantee as to the number of shares that will be repurchased, and the stock repurchase program may be extended, suspended or discontinued at any time without notice at FleetCor's discretion. Any repurchases are expected to be funded by available cash flow from the business and undrawn revolver.
 And finally, we are not a capital-intensive business, and we spent only $12 million on CapEx during the first quarter of 2016.
 Now on to our outlook for the remainder of 2016. Before I begin our discussion on guidance, I want to update you on our latest thinking about the macroeconomic environment. Although foreign exchange rates and fuel prices are trending a little better than our 2016 assumptions we provided on the January call, we are keeping our prior macro guidance unchanged until more of a trend can be established. We don't know how the environment will actually play out in 2016. But if it stays anywhere where it is today or continues to improve, some of the headwind we have been experiencing may come back as a tailwind.
 For the balance of the year, we are keeping our prior macro guidance intact, and we are estimating that foreign exchange rates will negatively impact revenue by approximately $32 million for the next 3 quarters compared to the 2015 average for the same period. And the absolute price of fuel is expected to be a headwind to revenue of approximately $32 million for the last 3 quarters versus the 2015 average over the comparable period.
 In addition, we believe market spreads will be better than historic levels but contribute approximately $7 million less revenue than 2015 spreads for the balance of the year. In aggregate, we believe the macroeconomic environment creates an approximately $70 million in revenue headwind and approximately a $0.50 cash EPS headwind for the rest of the year versus the 2015 averages.
 That being said, we expect total revenues to be between $1,730,000,000 and $1,780,000,000; adjusted net income to be between $608 million and $628 million; and adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $6.43 and $6.63 or $6.53 at the midpoint.
 Some of the assumptions that we have made in preparing this guidance include the following: weighted fuel prices equal to $1.91 per gallon average for 2016 compared to $2.56 per gallon average in 2015, a reduction of approximately 25%; market spreads returning to more historical levels for the rest of 2016, down approximately $7 million versus 2015; foreign exchange rates equal to the 7-day average ending January 15, 2016; the SVS business is retained for all of 2016; continued weakness in the company's Russian and Brazilian businesses; a full year tax rate of 31.9%; fully diluted shares outstanding of 94.7 million shares; and no impact related to acquisitions or material new partnership agreements.
 We have also not included any impact related to the previously announced STP acquisitions. We may have upside to this guidance in the range of $0.20 to $0.25 in adjusted net income per diluted share if we close STP, as expected, in the third quarter and the macro stays where it is today.
 As we stated on the STP call in March, we expect that an STP closing in the third quarter could add approximately $0.10 in incremental adjusted net income per diluted share. Also, if the macro stays where it is today, we could expect incremental revenue of approximately $20 million to $25 million and adjusted net income per diluted share of approximately $0.10 to $0.15.
 For those of you that are looking for guidance for the second quarter, I want to remind everyone that our business has some seasonality and the macro will have an impact on the second quarter, as I previously discussed. For the second quarter, we are expecting adjusted net income per diluted share to be approximately the same as the first quarter.
 Finally to remind everyone, our volumes build throughout the year and our new asset initiatives gain momentum throughout the year, resulting in a much higher earnings per share in the third and fourth quarters. Traditionally, our third and fourth quarters' earnings tend to be quite similar. We have no plans to provide quarterly guidance going forward but ready to update our annual guidance each quarter.
 And with that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of James Schneider with Goldman Sachs. 
James Schneider: Good performance in the Comdata fleet business again, I think, 12% growth you called out versus 13% growth last quarter. That's an improvement after you acquired it, clearly. But as we go into the back half of the year, how would you expect that business to trend? Would we see a deceleration there down to the high single digits or 10% range? Or is that a little bit too aggressive? 
Ronald F. Clarke: James, it's Ron. I would say if you looked at our plan, we'll probably step it up a point or 2 as we have through the year. 
James Schneider: Okay. That's a fair enough. And then maybe you could just update us on the same-store sales trend that you saw in the quarter. I don't think you broke it out, but you did last quarter. Any improvement then in the verticals that you touched on last quarter that was driving headwinds? Or is it pretty much same old, same old there? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, it's a little better. I think our consolidated number for Q1 is kind of minus 1%. So still a bit of a headwind. But I'd say it's more pocketed. There are places that are kind of okay to good and then some other places like CLC with the railroads and Russia, Brazil that are still quite bad, 7%, 8% negative. So it's not kind of an average across the board. It's quite pocketed. 
James Schneider: And then just one last one, if I could. Can you maybe just comment on the overall pricing landscape with respect to your different customer segments? Do you feel like you're sort of maxed out there in terms of what you were able to achieve in terms of pricing actions? Or do you feel there's a little bit more in some areas you can do? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, James, there's always more. It's just the decision of, like we say, how -- where to push and how to push. I'd say we're pretty comfortable where we are, but I would say there's always more opportunity. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods. 
Steven Kwok: This is actually Steven Kwok filling in for Sanjay. Just the first question is around STP. What was the next steps that you need to take in order to close the deal? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Steven, it's Ron. So I'd say there's some set of kind of closing conditions, a handful of closing conditions with the primary ones being antitrust approval. So we have filed that a few weeks back and our quote in that process, our best estimate again is kind of early Q3. So I'd say that's probably the long pole. 
Steven Kwok: Got it. And then just if you could comment around like same-store sales trends. Have you seen any diverging trends within, whether it's the U.S. or the rest of the world? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I mean, that was the comment I made. I'd say again that kind of on a weighted consolidated basis, we were minus 1%. But if you looked across our 15 or 20 businesses or geographies, there are a number that were in the plus column, some that were kind of flat and then a few that I called out were still quite negative, Brazil, Russia, the CLC railroads, 7%, 8% softness. So a mixed bag on same-store. 
Steven Kwok: Got it. And then last question just around the M&A landscape. Any particular areas you are looking at? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I mean, I think we sound like a bit of a broken record. I'm actually looking at our deal pipeline page sitting here on the call. So I would repeat again that we have a number. So more than 2 things that are "active" in our pipeline beyond STP. And I'd say to looking at the list, it runs the gamut, we've got a couple, 2, 3 kind of tuck-ins, small things that are in markets we're in, a couple of things that get us into a new geography. So again, I'd say it's a range of different opportunities. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. 
David Togut: Could you comment on AllStar performance in the quarter? You've been rolling out a chip card with AllStar through Visa. I'm wondering if that's affecting same-store transactions at all. And/or are you seeing any incremental revenue per transaction as you upgrade from max right to chip card? 
Ronald F. Clarke: David, it's Ron. I'd say it's probably still on the disappointing side. Not much different than I think when we spoke last. I don't have it in from of me, but I'd say the U.K. was probably south of 5% organic for the quarter, and it's mostly just pace. I think it's the same comments in the last call that the pace of conversions, we have about half the book converted, and then getting people to use the card properly that gives us the advantaged economics as a bit of a learning and then again getting the incremental salespeople to sell more of that product. So it's the combination of the 2 or 3 things that will create lift are still getting worked. So I would hope and our plans here that thing will trend up as we move through the year. 
David Togut: Got it. And then staying on International. Could you comment on the big oil pipeline a bit, whether you're seeing any movement in that? And what are the some of the big oils looking for in Europe to make a decision to outsource? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I think we mentioned although this thing is glacial, there are actually a couple opportunities, partner opportunities that have moved from kind of RFI to RFP. And I would say that we think there would be at least a couple, 2 partner decisions that would happen in this year in 2016. So we'll obviously be back here. But I'd say that the good news like there were a couple over the last couple of years, it appears that at least a couple have moved far enough ahead that they're going to make a decision. 
David Togut: And would those be more on the SME portfolio like Shell? Or could you see some of the larger fleet business being outsourced? 
Ronald F. Clarke: There's actually a couple of flavors in the 2. There's one that's got a more traditional take the program, and there's another one that looks more like the Exxon and Shell model. 
David Togut: Got it. Just a quick final question on Uber. I think you were -- Eric called out Uber as a growth driver. Could you put some numbers around that so we can understand how substantial that is and what the outlook might be? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Eric, you might have the numbers. I'd say, David, the thing again is rocking, right? We introduced it not quite a year ago. And both the adoption of drivers and usage has been high. And then Uber has continued, because people like it, drivers like it, to extend the offer to more drivers. So the thing is literally building sequentially. I mean, it is -- I would say it's probably 1 of the top 3 or 4 largest clients that we have now in terms of volume in North America already. And it's not a year old. And obviously, as you know, I mean, although not agreed or whatever, the opportunity to take that thing beyond the U.S. is still another huge opportunity if Uber gives us a call for that. 
Eric R. Dey: David, this is Eric. Just to add on to that, although Uber does have a lot of gallons and it is progressing very, very nicely, it is a lower revenue per tran product, just so you're clear. So it's not as revenue intensive as some of the other products that we have. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Danyal Hussain with Morgan Stanley. 
Danyal Hussain: It sounds like macro is in line. So were there any surprises in the quarter on a fundamental basis versus your expectations? Or is growth broadly in line? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Danyal, it's Ron. I'd say of the key macros, again, fuel price and FX was kind of spot on our plan. We did a little bit of headwind, I think, call it, $4 million or $5 million lower than our plan on spreads because fuel prices ticked up kind of starting mid-March. So that obviously contracted spreads a bit. So I'd say that's the only macro thing in the quarter. And then I'd say again, if you looked at our plan versus the consolidated thing, I'd say most, virtually all, businesses kind of are where we expected. So I'd say in the past few years, this was about as ratable a period as we've had in terms of our expectations against the actuals. 
Danyal Hussain: Got it. And you called out being in now 12 of the top 20 fuel markets. Can you give some color or examples of what the other 8 are and if those countries even have fuel cards or what the sort of path might look like to penetrate those markets? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I mean, the first thing I'd say is to have started out the first 7 years in the company being in the U.S. and to be in 12 of the top 20, and said repeatedly, of those 12, 6 of them we're just barely in. So the first point is there's enormous runway in the 12 served. But of the 8 not served, I mean, the biggest block would be obviously Asia. So the first 3 to come to mind would be China, Japan, South Korea. So we're not in those 3. Obviously, 2 of those are huge. And then in Continental Europe, a couple that jumped off to me are Italy and Spain that we're not in. I think Turkey as well is a top 20 that we're not in. And then I guess the last one that comes to mind that's huge that we're not in is India, which, I think, is a lot farther away. So I would say that we are chasing hard a couple of European geographies that we're not in. And I'd say the Asia one's probably a bit more difficult. 
Danyal Hussain: Got it. And Eric, maybe you can just clarify the tax benefit in the quarter. It sounded like it was $3 million of total benefit and is it -- of which $1.2 million was planned and might recur over the course of the year. And maybe you can just give, I guess, some guidance on what the full year rate might look like. 
Eric R. Dey: Yes, I think you're correct the way you said it. We worked on a couple of tax projects last year, and those tax projects concluded toward the end of the year last year. We did have some carryover effect to a couple of the projects where we booked some favorability into the first quarter. That really pertained to last year. It was kind of a couple of -- or $3 million that we called out. In addition to that, the tax projects will have an ongoing favorable impact to our tax rate of about, call it, $1 million or so per quarter, which we called out as well. And that will be ongoing. The balance of the year tax rate, expect something in the 31.9% range. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Willi with Wells Fargo. 
Timothy Willi: A couple of questions. First, just going back to CLC. I think that 7% number is probably one of the lowest at least I can recall in a while. And I know you called out oil and sort of energy markets as a drag. Could you maybe -- if you were to separate that vertical or those industries, what would the rest of CLC look like on an underlying basis? Just approximation if you don't have it exactly. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Tim, it's a Ron. So the short story on CLC, which was run in kind of mid-teens, mid- to high teens, so this softness started, call it, Q3 last year. So kind of 3 quarters in, Q3, Q4, Q1. And basically again, CLC is a business with 2 portfolios. One, it's got 25, 30 big clients. It's been around a long time, do huge volumes that include railroads, trucking firms, some oil companies, et cetera. And then it's got thousands and thousands of SMBs that's got 10, 15 cards. So the problem is in the first group where that group is quite soft and causing about 8% softness versus Q1 the prior year. So effectively, if those accounts were doing the volumes they were a year ago, that business would be at 15% again organic for the quarter. So the other half of the book is growing high teens and revenue close to 20%, and the larger account book is obviously not growing much because it's negative 8% softness. 
Timothy Willi: Okay. And a follow-up on this and then I have one more. I can't remember is if this was asked on a prior call. But within those large enterprises, I'm thinking about the Comdata customer base, can you just refresh our memory if you talked about it before, the cross-sell opportunity, are they there or are a lot of those big Comdata customers already CLC customers? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, that's a great question. We actually -- I think I did mention this. We private-labeled or Comdata-labeled the CLC program starting in Q4. So we took the CLC thing. We created a way to use the Comdata cards at the hotels. We trained up the Comdata sales group, and they've been out selling to both big and small accounts. And the last review I had a couple of weeks ago, I think we've on-boarded 300 new accounts in the first, whatever, 90, 120 days. So yes, we've had trucking -- CLC had trucking clients before we own Comdata, but now we packaged the product for Comdata and targeted our salespeople back to the Comdata base. And so the early views are great. The clients like that we have something else to offer them that's got some value, and a bunch of them are taking us up on it. 
Timothy Willi: Great. And then I had my last one just going to sort of the corporate payment side at SVS. I know you referenced the growth rate ex health care. Just sort of curious, now that you've had that asset, I guess, for a little bit over a year now, 15 months, give or take, have any new specialized verticals emerged for that application in terms of growth opportunities or anything around the sales side, just generally speaking, around corporate payments? Or are you sort of making the investments and maybe we're on the cusp of some things happening? Or is it going to be more sort of just steady as she goes kind of performance there ex health care? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Are you on SVS or you're on corporate payments, Tim? 
Timothy Willi: I am on corporate payments, the corporate payments business. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, so the corporate payments business, again, is a bit of a tale of 2 cities. The health care thing continues to be soft. A couple of big accounts we called out a year ago. One of those has kind of gone for good, and the other one is kind of slowly coming back. We got a bit of it, but we'll see more as we exit the year. So that business is really down, that little subsegment. But the rest of the business is up crazy amounts. The construction business is up 20% to 25%. The reseller business is up 30%. So we are -- I think I mentioned we're pouring. I think we doubled the sales headcount in that business in the last 6 months in terms of people literally on the street today. So the "business without health care" is growing well. And I'd say the sales, which is the lead indicator for revenue, are quite good. So again, I think we like it a lot other than the stub we had in health care. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Jefferies. 
Ramsey El-Assal: The growth in your MasterCard offering has been -- was obviously incredibly impressive in the quarter and has been helped for a long time. Can you once again help us think through the drivers of that growth? Maybe have those drivers changed over time? And also just a little bit of color on the sustainability of the growth. I know you mentioned Uber was a contributor this time around. But should we expect this kind of healthy revenue growth in this product category to just continue as far as the eye can see? Or what are your thoughts there? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Ramsey, it's Ron. So yes, I would probably say no to 48%. I think we sounded a little bit like Google with that. But I'd say we're super bullish on that thing being high teens, low 20s grower for kind of as far as we can see because it's a product that just fits everybody, right? Every geography, every size, group. So it's really we dialed that product in to be a really attractive product. The drivers of it are sales. We poured sales in it. So the volume, I think, I quoted up 17%. Some of that Uber, some of that is just again the sales investment. It's mix again. We're pouring money into digital. So we're going down market a bit. And some of that volumes were getting obviously much better rate as the mix keeps getting smaller in that portfolio. And then lastly, we did pour some rate stuff in Q1 of '15 when we saw the fuel prices tank. And so we're at a point here where we have that rate kind of sitting in Q1 of '16 and it didn't sit all that much in Q1 of '15. And so I'd say that the 48% is a bit artificially high for those couple of reasons. But again, this is a long-term grower for us. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Great. That's super helpful. A couple of quick ones on Sem Parar. How did the company do in the quarter? 
Ronald F. Clarke: It's funny. We reviewed that. I'd say it was exactly on expectation. So as part of our acquisition and theses, the company had a budget, and we -- FleetCor built a model. And what they've shared with us is basically spot on what we thought, which was quite comforting. 
Ramsey El-Assal: And last one also on Sem Parar. Any changes in the financing terms on that transaction? If I'm not mistaken, it seems like spreads have gotten a little bit more favorable since you announced the deal. I'm not sure if that's the case or not, but any incremental view on financing costs there? 
Eric R. Dey: No, it's about the same. We're financing that transaction through our existing debt facilities. So rates are effectively fixed in that facility. So expect to see something at LIBOR kind of plus 175 from a rate standpoint for that deal. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Great. My name was terrifying for the operator, I'm sure. Yes, so a lot of good details as always, guys. Just the sales, the booking dollars, I think, Ron, you said up 27%. Where are you putting -- where are you seeing some of that good sales performance? Is it more international, domestic? Is it in the same areas or maybe some new areas? Just trying to understand that better. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Tien-tsin, it's literally almost across the board. I've got the page here in front of me. I mean, the U.S. numbers were up big, part of it is because we a good quarter a year ago. The Comdata bookings were way, way up, right, because we made big investments both in the trucking line of business and in the corporate payments business. Shockingly, even our Russia sales are way up as that thing has started to stabilized a little bit, the people stabilized, the sales are way up. So I'd say other than Brazil, most other areas, the CLC business had a rocking up 34% over the prior year. So it's -- I don't know, investors are not as focused because it doesn't make its way into the P&L. But for us, it's the single best indicator of health, right? Shop your stuff today and the people want it and so it's quite encouraging for us to be up that much. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Sure. I know it sets the stage for growth to come, which is why I want to ask on the international side, organic growth. I think, Eric, you said it was 6% with some of the new sales and sales and marketing going into different areas. Can we see that improve? Or is it really going to be more of a macro cyclical thing that drives it? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes, Tien-tsin, it's a little of both. I mean, obviously, the macro impacted a lot of our international segments pretty dramatically in the quarter and same as last year. The good news is we are building some sales momentum in some of those geographies that we're investing more money in. As Ron called out, Russia as an example. We're pouring more money into places like the U.K. and hope to see some better results as we look kind of for the rest of the year. And I would say if we had one spot where we need to improve, again, it's kind of Brazil where we're seeing a bigger macro impact. But all in all, the sales were kind of really good in the quarter, and those will eventually translate into revenue as we move along. 
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentleman, that's all the time we have for questions today. This does conclude today's teleconference. I'd like to [indiscernible]. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2015 Q4  (2016-02-04 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the FleetCor Technologies' Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Also as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Eric Dey, CFO. Thank you. You may now begin. 
Eric R. Dey: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. By now, everyone should have access to our fourth quarter press release. It can be found at www.fleetcor.com under the Investor Relations section. Throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than other companies' similarly titled non-GAAP information. Quantitative reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today's press release and on our website, as previously described. Also, we are providing 2016 guidance on a non-GAAP basis.
 Finally, before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements. This may include forward-looking statements about our 2016 guidance, new products and fee initiatives and expectations regarding business development and acquisitions. They are not guarantees of future performance and therefore, you should not put undue reliance on them. These results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release. Others are described in our annual report on Form 10-K. These documents are available on our website, as previously discussed, and at www.sec.gov.
 With our disclosures out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay. Eric, thanks. And good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining today. Up front here, I'll plan to cover 3 subjects: First, I'll comment on our Q4 results; second, I'll review 2015 full-year results and a bit on our progress; and finally, I'll discuss our 2016 outlook and guidance.
 Okay. So onto the quarter. We reported Q4 revenue of $431 million. That's up 14% and cash EPS of $1.70, up 22%, so 14% top line, 22% bottom line. Q4 presented quite a challenging macro environment for us. You could say we hit the trifecta of low fuel prices, weak FX and even unfavorable fuel spreads versus Q4 2014.
 Combined, these factors resulted in approximately a $56 million headwind to revenue in the quarter and a $0.36 headwind to cash EPS in the quarter.
 And if these 3 things were not enough, our same-store sales were a bit weak in the quarter as well due to the U.S. railroad and U.S. oil-related industries being quite soft, along with the ongoing weakness in both Russia and Brazil. So quite a bit of environmental challenge in Q4.
 If you were to look at FleetCor in the quarter on a like-for-like or constant basis, we actually had a very good quarter. Our organic adjusted revenue growth was approximately 10% for the quarter. Revenue fundamentals quite sound underneath all this macro noise. And again, with $0.36 of cash EPS headwind, instead of reporting 22% profit growth, we would have reported 48% profit growth in a constant environment. So look, the point again is quite healthy underneath all the noise.
 So in terms of themes for the quarter, let me start with Comdata. So Comdata contributed quite a bit of incremental revenue in Q4, given the anniversary date was mid-quarter. And inside of that, our Comdata trucking fuel card business was up 12%, so 12% for the quarter, which is really a terrific exit rate for that business.
 Our U.S. MasterCard business continued to perform exceptionally well in the quarter, up 43% on a constant fuel price. Pac Pride, one of our newest acquisitions, doubled revenue in the quarter on the strength of an extended network card. We got incremental revenue from the Shell Europe outsourcing initiative, entering 3 new European markets in the quarter. And then lastly, we did have some tax favorability, which resulted in a lower Q4 tax rate. Eric will expand on the details in his section.
 So look, all in all, a pretty good Q4 performance.
 Okay. Let me transition now over to full year 2015. So we reported revenue of $1.7 billion, up 42% and full year cash EPS of $6.30, up 22% versus 2014. So that makes 5 years in a row that FleetCor, since it went public in 2010, has reported 20% plus annual profit growth, so quite pleased with that.
 So in terms of 2015, to say that it was a crazy macro environment would be an understatement, and the fact that we printed 22% profit growth for the full year, that's quite encouraging.
 If you were to look at full year 2015 on a like-for-like basis, a constant basis, we would have reported $1.08 of incremental cash EPS. So instead of our reported number of $6.30, you're looking at a number of $7.38, which would be a 43% profit growth over 2014. You'd have the same story on the revenue side. Underneath all this macro headwind, our businesses continue to meet our organic adjusted revenue growth target of 10%, which, again, they did for 2015, excluding SVS. So look, that continues to position the company quite well going forward.
 So beyond the numbers for 2015, we did make a lot of strategic progress in the year. So first off, Comdata. We progressed in terms of integration. We installed 2 new executives to run the 2 main businesses. And obviously, we're off to a good start, executing against our growth plans. The trucking business, I mentioned a bit ago, up 12% in the quarter and corporate payments business up 13% in the quarter, excluding health care. So pleased with Comdata, first year.
 Our second area of progress in '15 was with our partners. We're delighted that we renewed our BP relationship for a second time. We also advanced proof of our European outsourcing capability by implementing 5 new European markets successfully for Shell. We're hopeful that, that builds further trust for other major oils.
 Many of our growth businesses kept on going in 2015. Our U.S. MasterCard business was up 38% on a constant fuel price for the full year. CLC up 13%, despite some big time railroad slowdowns in the second half of the year.
 Our Pac Pride business revenue up about 50% in 2015 and Efectivale, our Mexico business, up 14% in local currency. So again, a number of our growth businesses continuing to do well. In terms of stability, we're quite pleased with 3 of our businesses that are in difficult markets. So our Russia business flat in local currency, despite that economy down. Our Brazil business flat in local currency, with that market down. And our Czech business flat in local currency, which is a bit of a turnaround for that business. So although it may not seem it, good news in terms of 3 businesses holding their own against the prior year in pretty weak economies.
 And lastly, we're pleased that we did some new things in 2015. We launched our AllStar One card, which is our new U.K. chip card. We converted about half of all of our clients to that product by the end of '15, so good progress there. We got our European universal card finally live in Germany and continued to work out the bugs of that product. We launched our new Comdata Hotel card program for trucking clients, which uses the CLC hotel network. In the first month, we signed up about 100 clients, representing about $1 million of annualized revenue, so good start. And then finally, we launched Uber in the spring of 2015 and that has been really a great success. 
            So look, all in all, 2015, a very solid financial year, profits up over 20% and a decent amount of strategic progress accomplished.
 Okay, so last, let me transition over to our 2016 outlook. Today, we're providing 2016 guidance of $1.755 billion in revenue at the midpoint and $6.50 in cash EPS at the midpoint.
            The story of 2016 again looks like a macro environment story. Each of the key macro variables that affect us, fuel price, FX and interest rates are all in a worse place than they were for the full year or the average for 2015. And if you aggregate these environmental factors, we're estimating approximately $100 million revenue headwind in 2016 versus a constant '15 and approximately a $0.70 cash EPS headwind in '16 versus a constant '15. So again, a lot of challenge setting up here. If you were to look at our guidance this year on a constant or like-for-like basis, we're still planning adjusted revenue growth of 10% for full year 2016. And again, on a constant basis, cash EPS would be $7.20, not the $6.50 in a constant environment. So look, the good news in all of this is that we continue to power through a very negative environment for 2 years in a row and that, underneath all this macro noise, we want to reiterate that our growth fundamentals are quite sound.
 So with that, let me turn the call back over to Eric. He'll provide some additional information on the quarter, the year and our outlook. Eric? 
Eric R. Dey: Thank you, Ron. For the fourth quarter of 2015, we reported revenue of $430.6 million, an increase of 14% from the fourth quarter of 2014. The revenue from our North American segment increased 27.1% to $313.6 million from $246.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.
 Included in the fourth quarter results was the impact of Comdata, which was acquired on November 14, 2014. Revenue from our International segment decreased 10% to $117 million from $129.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.
 For the fourth quarter of 2015, GAAP net income decreased 52% to $52.8 million or $0.56 per diluted share from $109.5 million or $1.21 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2014.
 Included in GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2015 was a $40 million noncash impairment charge related to our minority investment in Masternaut and a $34 million increase in noncash stock compensation expense compared to 2014.
 The other financial metrics that we routinely use are adjusted revenues and adjusted net income, which are sometimes also referred to as cash net income or cash EPS. Adjusted revenues equal our GAAP revenues less merchant commissions. We use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate the company's revenues, net of the commissions that are paid to merchants, who participate in certain card programs. We prepare adjusted net income to eliminate the effects of noncash items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance. A reconciliation of adjusted revenues and adjusted net income to GAAP numbers are provided in Exhibit 1 of our press release.
 Adjusted revenues in the fourth quarter of 2015 increased 17% to $403.1 million compared to $343.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.
 Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2015 increased 27% to $160.2 million or $1.70 per diluted share compared to $125.8 million or $1.39 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2014.
 Elements of the macroeconomic environment had a significant impact on our results in the fourth quarter, specifically, market fuel spread margins, fuel prices and foreign exchange rates. In the aggregate, we estimated that these macroeconomic items negatively impacted our business in the fourth quarter of 2014 (sic)[2015]
 versus the fourth quarter of 2014 by approximately $56 million in adjusted revenue or approximately $0.36 in adjusted net income per diluted share.
 In addition, we are also seeing some same-store sales softness in the quarter. We estimate about 2% to 3% globally. We believe the softness is due primarily to the U.S. railroad and oil-related industries as you would expect, along with ongoing weakness in both Russia and Brazil.
 On a constant currency fuel price and market spread margin basis, we estimate that we would have reported approximately $2.06 in adjusted net income per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $1.39 in the fourth quarter of 2014 or a growth rate of approximately 48%.
 Changes in foreign exchange rates were unfavorable in all geographies for the quarter, and overall, we believe negatively impacted adjusted revenues during the quarter by approximately $20 million.
 Fuel prices and fuel spread margins also decreased during the quarter versus prior year. And although we cannot precisely calculate the impact of these changes, we believe they negatively impacted adjusted revenues by approximately $36 million.
 To better understand the organic growth for the quarter, we calculated revenues using constant currency, fuel price and market spread margins. Based on these criteria, we estimate that we would have reported an approximately 9% organic growth rate for the quarter, excluding the SVS business, and approximately 10% on a consolidated basis.
 For the fourth quarter of 2015, transaction volumes increased 50% to 568 million transactions compared to 380 million transactions in the fourth quarter of 2014.
 The increase in total transactions was due primarily to the acquisition of Comdata on November 14, 2014, and also organic growth in our businesses. Excluding the impact of Comdata, our transaction volumes were 95.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 91.8 million transactions in the fourth quarter of 2014 or a growth rate of approximately 3.9%.
 North America segment transactions grew 58%, driven primarily by the acquisition of Comdata and also organic growth in our U.S. businesses. Transaction volumes in our International segment were down approximately 5.8% to 45.8 million transactions. Transaction volumes in the International segment were impacted primarily by market softness in some of the international businesses.
 For a more meaningful discussion on revenue per transaction, we will exclude the impact of the SVS business, which had approximately 429 million transactions in the quarter at a very low revenue per transaction.
 Revenue per transaction for the fourth quarter of 2015, excluding the SVS business, decreased 15.2% to $2.79 from $3.29 in the fourth quarter of 2014.
 Revenue per transaction can vary based on the geography, the relevant merchant and customer relationship, the payment product utilized and the types of products and services purchased.
 The revenue mix was influenced by our acquisitions, organic growth in the business and fluctuations in the macroeconomic environment, as previously discussed.
 Revenue per transaction, excluding SVS, decreased approximately 23.1% in North America due primarily to lower fuel prices and fuel spreads during the quarter versus the prior year quarter. In the International segment, revenue per transaction decreased 4.5% due primarily to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates across all of our geographies. This unfavorable impact was partially offset by organic revenue growth in several lines of business.
 Now let's shift over and discuss some of the other drivers of our fourth quarter performance.
 For our North American segment, most of our lines of business performed well. On a constant currency, fuel spread and fuel price basis, we estimate that the organic growth rate in the quarter was approximately 12%, excluding the impact of the Comdata acquisition. Some of the positive drivers in the North America revenue during the quarter were similar to the last several quarters, including the exceptional performance of our MasterCard product, which had estimated revenue growth of approximately 43% over the fourth quarter of 2014 measured in constant fuel price. The growth in MasterCard was driven by increases in both transactions and revenue per transaction measured on a constant fuel price basis.
 CLC had another solid quarter with 8% revenue growth over the fourth quarter of 2014. This revenue growth was driven primarily by increases in our CheckINN Direct product, which targets smaller accounts. Our Comdata business, excluding SVS, performed well in the quarter and had an organic growth rate of approximately 8% on a constant fuel price basis versus prior year. And as I've mentioned in prior quarters, the Comdata organic growth rate in 2015 was impacted by lower RFID sales in our trucking business and higher opt-out rates in the health care segment. International segment revenue was down approximately 10% in the fourth quarter of 2015 versus the fourth quarter of 2014. This decrease was driven primarily by unfavorable foreign exchange rates in all geographies, which negatively impacted adjusted revenues by approximately $20 million in the quarter versus last year. On a constant currency and fuel price basis, organic growth was approximately 7% for the quarter.
 Some of the international highlights for the quarter include the continued conversion of the Shell small business portfolio. We are now in a total of 7 markets with a plan to convert the remainder of the markets in 2016. Our Mexico business continued to perform well and posted double-digit gains. And on the downside, economies in Brazil and Russia continue to struggle and are impacting volumes in those markets.
 Now moving down the income statement. Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $284.5 million compared to $204.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of 39%. As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses increased to 66.1% of revenue compared to 54.2% in the fourth quarter of 2014, included in operating expenses are merchant commissions, processing expenses, bad debt, selling and general and administrative expense, depreciation and amortization expense and other operating net.
 Included in the fourth quarter of 2015 operating expense were additional operating expenses and significant additional amortization expense related to the acquisition of Comdata. In addition, noncash-stock compensation included in general and administrative expense was $45.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to only $11.4 million in the fourth quarter last year.
 Excluding the impact of the additional noncash stock compensation expense, we estimate that operating expenses as a percentage of revenue would have been approximately 58%.
 Also to remind everyone, we booked approximately $26 million of deal-related expenses in the fourth quarter of 2014. Also included in operating expense for the fourth quarter of 2014 was an approximately $29 million gain in unusual items, reflecting a decline in amounts for contingent consideration and tax indemnification for the company's 2013 acquisitions of DB and VB in Brazil.
 Credit losses were $6.3 million for the quarter or approximately 3 basis points compared to $6.3 million or 13 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2014. The 10 basis point decrease in bad debt was due primarily to the inclusion of Comdata in the quarter, which had bad debt as a percentage of its billed revenue significantly below the Fleetcor average.
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 27% to $48 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 from $37.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase is primarily due to amortization of intangible assets related to the Comdata acquisition. Also, the company booked a loss of $3.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 related to our minority investment in Masternaut compared to a loss of $4.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.
 We regularly evaluate our investments, which are not carried at fair value for other than temporary impairment in accordance with GAAP. As part of the review, we determined that the performance improvement initiatives implemented in Masternaut will take longer to implement than we originally projected. As a result, we have recorded a $40 million noncash impairment charge in the equity investment line in the income statement.
 Interest expense increased 24.9% to $16.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 from $13.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase in interest expense was due primarily to additional borrowings to finance the Comdata acquisition.
 Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 38.4% compared to 21.9% for the fourth quarter of 2014. However, the noncash impairment charge resulted in a reduction in basis in Masternaut for book purposes, but not tax purposes. Although this temporary book/tax basis difference resulted in the company increasing its deferred tax asset related to its equity investment in Masternaut, the company also increased its valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset. Excluding this noncash item, our tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2015 would've been 26.2%.
 Also included in the fourth quarter was an approximate $6 million favorable adjustment, primarily related to the reversal of prior year uncertain tax positions due to the statute of limitations expiring, a reduction in Comdata state tax rate due to Comdata being included in the company's state tax structure and the impact of a reduction in the U.K. statutory tax rate in 2017 through 2020.
 The lower statutory rates in the U.K. resulted in a reduction to the company's net deferred tax liabilities related to its U.K. subsidiaries. Excluding the impacts of these unusual items, our income tax rate in the fourth quarter would have been approximately 30.6%.
 To remind everyone, the 21.9% tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2014 was due primarily to a $9.5 million reversal of a deferred tax liability established in conjunction with the DB acquisition in Brazil as a result of the completion of some entity consolidations.
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $614.6 million in total cash, approximately $167.5 million is restricted and are primarily customer deposits.
 As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $1.9 billion outstanding on our term A loan, $240 million outstanding on our term B loan and approximately $160 million drawn on our revolver, leaving approximately $875 million of undrawn availability.
 We also had approximately $614 million borrowed against our securitization facility.  As of December 31, 2015, our leverage ratio was 2.45x EBITDA, down from 2.49x in the third quarter, which is well below our covenant level of 4.25x EBITDA.
 And finally, we are not a capital intensive business and we spent only $12.3 million on CapEx during the fourth quarter of 2015.
 On February 4, 2016, our Board of Directors has authorized a repurchase of up to $500 million of FleetCor's common stock for an 18-month period ending August 1, 2017. The shares may be purchased from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or in other manners as permitted by federal securities laws and other legal requirements.
 The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases will be determined by FleetCor in its discretion and will be subject to economic and market conditions, stock price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. There is no guarantee as to the number of shares that will be repurchased. And the stock repurchase program may be extended, suspended or discontinued at any time without notice at FleetCor's discretion. The repurchase is expected to be funded by available cash flow from the business and working capital.
 Now onto our outlook for 2016. For 2016, we again have a number of macroeconomic headwinds affecting our business, primarily foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and spreads. We are estimating that foreign exchange rates will negatively impact revenue by approximately $40 million compared to the 2015 average, and the absolute price of fuel is expected to be a headwind to revenue of approximately $45 million versus the 2015 average. In addition, we believe market spreads will be better than historic levels, but contribute approximately $15 million less revenue than 2015 spreads. In aggregate, we believe the macroeconomic environment creates approximately a $100 million revenue headwind and approximately $0.70 cash EPS headwind versus the 2015 averages.
 That being said, we expect total revenues to be between $1,730,000,000 and $1,780,000,000; adjusted net income to be between $605 million and $625 million; adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $6.40 and $6.60 or $6.50 at the midpoint. We don't know how the environment will actually play out in 2016, but if it improves this year, some of the headwind may come back as a tailwind. 
 Some of the assumptions that we have made in preparing this guidance include the following: Weighted fuel price equal to $1.91 per gallon average for 2016 compared to $2.56 per gallon average in 2015, a reduction of approximately 25%; market spreads returning to more historical levels for 2016, but down approximately $15 million versus 2015. Foreign exchange rates equal to the 7-day average ended January 15, 2016. The SVS business is retained for 2016. Continued weakness in the company's Russian and Brazilian businesses, a full-year tax rate of 32.2%, fully diluted shares outstanding of 94.7 million shares and as always, no impact related to acquisitions or material new partnership agreements not already disclosed.
 For those of you that are looking for guidance for the quarter, I want to remind everyone that our business has some seasonality and that typically, the first quarter is the lowest in terms of both revenue and profit. First quarter seasonality is impacted by weather, holidays in the U.S., Christmas being celebrated in Russia in January and lower business levels in Brazil due to the summer break and the carnival celebration occurs in the first quarter.
 With that said, we are expecting our first quarter adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $1.47 and $1.53 or $1.50 at the midpoint. Additionally, our volumes build throughout the year and our new asset initiatives gain momentum throughout the year resulting in higher earnings per share in the second through fourth quarters.
 And with that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. 
James Schneider: I was wondering if you can maybe comment on Europe in general, particularly your progress with Shell and some of the proof points you demonstrated there. And then onto the broader question of the environment for more outsourcing deals in Europe. Now that, that proof point is established, where do you think the oil companies' heads are at, given where -- the progress you've made with Shell? And what do you think we can expect over the next 12 months? 
Ronald F. Clarke: It's a good question, Jim. Thank god there was a question, we didn't think there would be any. So we entered 2 new markets in Q4. So what are we now, Eric? 
Eric R. Dey: Seven. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Seven, Jim, in total. So another 4 or 5 this year. And it's going well so hopefully, it builds some confidence basically that we are reliable and deliver on what we say. So we're hopeful that their confidence will grow. There are, I've mentioned before, a couple of active RFIs over there, so there are people sawing the wood here. 
James Schneider: That's helpful. And then maybe as a follow-up, if you could just maybe comment more broadly on the M&A environment, what you're seeing out there in terms of prices of assets, whether more things are becoming available and whether you're more likely to take a look at something in more of a distressed emerging market versus something more like in the U.S., for example. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I'd characterize it as active, I'd say. We're probably as busy now as I can recall. I'd say prices are probably high but getting a little more realism in the last few months with the market trending down. But again, we look at things kind of on a forward year, Jim, a year-1 basis. And so that's more our focus than trailing. Yes, so we're busy and we're late stages on a few deals now. 
James Schneider: And just one quick follow-up, if I could. It appears that the equity market seems to be looking rather unfavorably on companies that are doing pretty high levels of leverage. So is that coloring your view in terms of the size of deal you want to do? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I think we're in the same place we've been. We said, I think, repeatedly, we want to run a company in and around 3x. And I think Eric just laid out we were what, 2.45x on a trailing basis. So we could spend $1 billion and basically still be 3x or under. So we're feeling good. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: I guess I had a question on the same-store sales numbers. Obviously, a pretty meaningful downshift per your comments. Could you just talk about the risk it could get worse and kind of what's baked into your guidance? 
Eric R. Dey: Sanjay, this is Eric. What I called out is if you look at our same-store sales globally, we saw softness in the 2% to 3% range. And that softness is kind of centered in a couple of areas. One, from a domestic perspective, it really is those accounts that do more business in the oil and gas area. As you would expect, a lot of businesses have cut back in that area and that's reflected in our volumes, with accounts that are servicing that sector. We've seen a little bit of negative momentum in the railroad sector in the United States, particularly related to our CLC business. So there's been some softness kind of in the fourth quarter. And then mainly internationally, it's in the economies you would think of. It's primarily Brazil, which has seen a pretty dramatic softening kind of in same-store sales, and then to a lesser degree, in Russia. And then we've got -- the remainder of our businesses are pretty good shape, either kind of flat or up a little bit. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: So in your guidance, are you assuming that conditions persist as is? 
Eric R. Dey: That's correct. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Okay. A second question just on SBS, understanding for guidance purposes, you guys are leaving it in. But is that how we should think about how you are thinking about that asset strategically? Or are there still options on the table? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I'd say we're leaving it in and we are still sawing wood on the alternative that I mentioned the last time. We had a bit of a snag on something that we've cleared, so I think we're closer, finally, to finishing. 
Sanjay Sakhrani: Okay. One final question, Eric, maybe you can help me with, the spreads piece where you've basically assumed a downshift. If gas prices stabilize from here on out, is it fair that there would be no impact going into next year? Or is there still an impact in terms of normalization of the spreads? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, we look at it from a year-over-year basis and spreads have been running at an abnormally high level. There's always a possibility they could continue to run at an abnormally high level. We just assumed that they kind of have gone back to more of a normal level in 2016. So if fuel prices do normalize, I mean, it's -- obviously, it's kind of unpredictable exactly where it's going to go. We think they're going to remain higher than the long-term historical average but kind of a little below where it ran in 2015. 
Eric R. Dey: But again, our guidance is assuming that we're getting pretty low and again, spreads widen when absolute fuel prices drop, and so they dropped a ton in the second half of '15. So we're assuming that we're mostly down and so spreads would be, we think, more normal. 
Operator: Our next question is from the line of David Togut from Evercore ISI. 
David Togut: Nice to see you hit the low teens exit rate on Comdata. I know you wanted to clear 10% in the fourth quarter, so very good to see that. I'm wondering if this is a sustainable growth rate for this business or is there room for some acceleration from where we are? 
Eric R. Dey: David, yes, I'd say we're staring at our '16 plans in front of us and the 2 main Comdata businesses are planned to be high double digits, so closing in on 20% for 2016. So I'd say that we've put some of the things in this year that we had hoped for, and we got some evidence of it exiting Q4, and we're planning good growth for both this year. So we're pretty pleased. 
David Togut: And then in connection with that, Ron, is there still room for incremental cost take out? Or are you at the run rate that you expect to sustain? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, we've -- that's a good question. We've taken some additional costs but we've kind of poured it back in, David, on sales. We've put another $3 million or $4 million incremental into corporate payments and sales and we've put another, I don't know, 20, 30 people additional in the plans in the trucking business. So some of the costs we did take out, we put in with good calories. I'd say the main thing that's left that's probably not this year but might be next year is IT. We've got some plans to convert some of the Comdata businesses onto our global platform and have a bit of a variable cost structure with the supplier there. So if we're successful in kind of moving some of that business off their platform, we will see a pretty substantial IT cost savings. But probably not this year, it's probably a '17 number. 
David Togut: Got it. And then, the 43% growth in direct MasterCard revenue was pretty extraordinary in this environment. How should we think about the growth rate in this product for 2016? 
Eric R. Dey: Again, I think we say this to you all the time, it's -- a lot of it's a function of how much we invest. We're investing another $20 million plus in sales in our '16 plan, so the volumes again continue to be great. The mix keeps getting better because we're getting down market with that product, so our rates are better on smaller accounts. And we did put some fees in because the clients are enjoying a much lower absolute bill right from us. So I think we continue to say, David, it's not opportunity limited, it's really investment and execution limited. 
David Togut: Got it. Quick final question. You're looking at capital allocation big picture, you've announced a $500 million buyback. I think the last time you bought back stock was beginning of '13. You've got potentially a big acquisition on the table. And then SBS, you're trying to sell. How do you look at this altogether? And can you give us a sense of how you evaluate buyback versus acquisition at current prices? 
Ronald F. Clarke: I mean, the first thing I'd say is we've gotten into a good place. We like, again, where the leverage is now post Comdata would be one. Two, we're a buyer, at this price, at this multiple, an 18x or 19x price on current year earnings feels low to us, below a 1 tag on a 20% plus grower. So we like this price as a buyer. And I'd say, three, the math that we do says we can do both, that we can basically buy back stock with our cash flow and fund, let's say, $1 billion this year and still be kind of around the 3x number. And so when we concluded that math, we said, at this price, we're going to do both. But I said this repeatedly, if we get into a place where there's a choice and we have a deal that we like, we're picking the deal. And the reason is because we always think we can do more with an asset over a longer cycle. So if forced to decide between the 2, that's what we'd pick. But fortunately, we're kind of not forced to decide, so our plan is to chase both. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Just wanted to clarify, I guess, the walk to the $7.20 on the constant macro. I guess that's 14% growth versus the $6.30. So what would it take to get to the 20-plus percent? Would you need some better same-store performance? Is that the key difference? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I think, Tien-tsin, we've said kind of the organic model is kind of 10% and 14% or 10% and 15% given the margins that the business has gotten to now. So to kind of fill the boat with the other 5-plus percent, we either get some kind of big partner deals or we buy. And so again, we've said before, if we're generating, what is it, $600 million in free cash flow? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes. 
Ronald F. Clarke: And again, you buy that at 10x trailing and you improve it like we do, that adds the incremental earnings to basically get us above 20%. So the goal over 1-, 2-, 3-year cycle is to do both things, keep growing the top at 10% and organically at 14% or 15% and use the cash flow to buy earnings that we can improve that keep the thing going above 20%. And I think the good news, despite all the would have, could have speech we gave about the macro, just to help you guys do the math, is the businesses are still growing 10%. So when we do the estimating for the last couple of years, we're still growing the collective set of businesses 10% on the top and we've built a plan for '16 that we'd like to do it again. And so I think we're comfortable that the organic machine is basically working, and we need to pull the trigger on deals that we like to deliver the growth that we promised. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Right. No, look, you're executing well. I know it's a tough macro, certainly stuff we haven't seen in a long time. 
Ronald F. Clarke: I know. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: But maybe a second build-up question just to high -- you talked about the high growth in the fourth quarter in 2015 if you adjust for the macro, all helpful. But how much of that high growth do you think is fueled by maybe actions you took because of a lower fuel environment, right, because you're trying to fight for growth as well. Is there a way to quantify that Eric and Ron? Do you follow my question? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes, I got it, Tien-tsin. I mean, certainly, there is a mix of the 2, right? I mean, if you look at kind of our transaction growth in the quarter, we grew transactions a shade under kind of 4%, that's causing some of the growth. And obviously, we are investing in those products that are higher than the line average revenue per transaction, so there's certainly a bunch of mix kind of in there as well as we normally have. And there certainly is some favorability associated with some of the pricing actions that we've taken around the world. I don't have an exact quantification of that, but there's certainly some of it in there. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Got you. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, and again, Tien-tsin, some of it would be feathered right during the year. So when you think about things we did, the planet fell apart about the same time last year, kind of Q4 and the beginning of '15. So I'd say that -- those set of actions were spread right during the year. So there's more in the exit rate than in the full year, so we wouldn't have much of an issue. And then b, we clearly have other things in the kitchen that we've worked on that create more growth in earnings like the Pac Pride thing I referenced. Our revenues are double, think about it, double in the quarter. And we bought that thing, what, 1.5 years ago? 
Eric R. Dey: 1.5 years ago, yes. 
Ronald F. Clarke: So there's a number of those things like the Comdata hotel card, there's things in every business that are kind of adding money to stay at the 10%. So I'd say that the outlook is pretty healthy, that we're kind of planning just a good tran [ph] growth, some good new product growth, some incremental sales investment and probably less rate action here in '16 than in prior years. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Got it. No, that's great to hear. Right, because Pac Pride and MasterCard was running hotter in the fourth than the full. I don't want to hog the call, but just one more. Just on the -- I don't know, is there a way to comment, I know there's a lot of press around the Brazil towing [ph] sort of asset. Is there anything you can say about that? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Not really, other than we're always looking, as you know, always, always looking. 
Operator: The next question is from Ashish Sabadra from Deutsche Bank. 
Ashish Sabadra: My question was around the international business. So you talked about the puts and takes there, Brazil and Russia still being challenging, but Mexico and U.K. are doing well. We saw the revenue growth improve there from 4% in third quarter to 7% in the fourth quarter. So can you help us understand what's driving that growth and how should I -- how should we think about the international growth on a constant currency basis in fiscal year '16? 
Eric R. Dey: Ashish, this is Eric. Yes, I mean the numbers kind of bounce around a little bit. We had a reasonably good quarter internationally. I mean all things considered, Ron called a couple of things out on the call. As an example, our U.K. business did perform reasonably well. Our Epyx business that we bought, now a couple years ago, we've implemented. We've added money into sales and marketing function there. We're starting to see some progress in that business. We've added a bunch of revenue in euroShell. We've added 3 or 4 new markets this year. Don't forget, Shell also awarded us kind of some cross-border business there, as well. So we're seeing a lot of incremental revenue associated with that kind of win. And then unfortunately, on the downside, it's a few things that kind of Ron called out. Brazil is softening but relatively flat, Czech Republic is flat and Russia surprisingly is relatively flat as well. So it's a bit of a mixed bag, some things are doing kind of well and a couple of things are kind of flat. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, let me just add on to that. I described it to you as kind of the international is a tale of 2 cities. So there's the trouble places like Brazil and Russia, and for us even, Czech, which are basically flat, as I said, in local currency and kind of out looking flat. And then the rest of the international like the U.K., the Europe, outsourcing thing, Mexico, Australia, those businesses are all up, some of them are way up. So I think it's the lift of the second set of things that are carrying the things that are kind of flat. 
Eric R. Dey: Right. And if you can turn those economies around for us, we'd be appreciative. 
Ashish Sabadra: No, that's absolutely -- no, that's good to know. And then on CLC, that did slow down in the fourth quarter and again, you called out some headwinds there. But as you think about cross-selling CLC into the Comdata and the initial success that you've had there, what are your thoughts on acceleration in that particular part of the business? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I'd say, the first comment, we're quite surprised. The railroad business has always been a pretty big piece of CLC from kind of way back in the day, a big piece of the volume. And I'd say it's been for years, like way before we bought it, rock solid, steady as she goes, up a few percent, bedrock kind of business. And it really took a hit, kind of starting in the second half, so it was again a big piece of the business. So that, I'd say, is a little surprising. I'd say going forward, we like the growth in the CheckINN Direct, which is obviously not railroad. And we haven't really factored in the Comdata lift because the program is so new, so we didn't put a lot into the plan. But I'd say that from when we started the planning process, it is way more exciting in terms of early returns than we would have thought. And that goes back to just such a large part of the room nights bought in CLC are in this trucking industry. So call us stupid, but it was natural to obviously go to our trucking clients and make those offers. So we'll keep you posted, but that could obviously provide some upside to CLC. 
Ashish Sabadra: No, that sounds good. And then one final question for me on the virtual card. I think you mentioned it could be -- the growth rate could accelerate in fiscal year '16, maybe getting close to 20%, that's great news. I was just wondering if you had any update on one of the providers that was expected to come back? Any update on that front or any update on the healthcare vertical? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, so I think it's probably close to a year ago now we called out the kind of the blip in the healthcare. Kind of 2 accounts quickly kind of went away, one was a big hospital chain and another one was a big account. And so we're kind of 1 of 2, the big hospital chain has stayed away, and the second account has come back. I think we've booked probably 10% or 15% already in our plan. Most of that will come back as we work our way through 2016. So we're expecting that account to kind of be back almost in full as we exit this year. 
Ashish Sabadra: Okay. No, that's very helpful. Actually if I can ask one more, the last one would be a follow-up to Tien-tsin's question. Would be like, when you think about deploying capital in Brazil, especially given the macro weakness and currency weakness, would that even be a consideration of you? I don't know if you can comment on it, but just I might as well ask. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean, look, we've been in Brazil for 3 or 4 years. And I think we've said it repeatedly, we are -- we're long on Brazil. It sets up very well for what we do, this workforce payments, it's got fuel cards and food cards and commuter cards and toll cards. It's got all kinds of workforce products and it's still kind of early days for a lot of those products, and a lot of those products are tax-advantaged. So we really like the country in terms of potential for our category. And so things were good when we got in 3 or 4 years ago and things are crummy now. And our guess is they'll be better a different day. So for the right kind of company, we'd still be long on Brazil. 
Operator: And our last question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Barclays. 
Darrin Peller: Look, I just want to come back to the expenses side and the margin side. I mean you're operating under a -- obviously, a pressured macro environment and yet you're still obviously growing well on a sort of constant macro standpoint. But just recognizing '16 is going to still have a lot of these headwinds, can you give us a little more color on how you operate your -- like what -- from an incremental margin standpoint, what parts of your business do you think are being impacted the most right now? Is there -- still the same capability to reinvest the way you want to reinvest across the business and achieve your goals on growth as well at the same time? And then really, what -- if there's any more opportunity to kind of cause us to revisit that topic one more time? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Darrin, it's Ron. I'd say that on the bad calorie side, we continue to take cost out. And obviously, as we scale and as we automate things, I'd say some of our cost lines actually decreased going into '16. And the good calories, the 2 things we try to spend money on are sales, which we're investing over $20 million incremental in our plan for '16; and then kind of discretionary IT to build stuff and convert stuff and so on. And so I'd say more than 100% of the expense increase in 2016 are these sets of good calorie things. And the quote, all the rest of the expenses would be flat to down, and even with the FX. Obviously, the FX has got -- I don't know what those number is, an $8 million to $10 million expense haircut just moving the FX across. 
Darrin Peller: Okay. All right, that's helpful. And just one quick follow-up on Europe as well. You mentioned the universal program kicking off, going live. Look, obviously, I think you mentioned that could be -- you've mentioned in the past that could be, down the road, an enormous opportunity comparable to what the U.S. has been longer term. Can you just give us a little bit of an update on your expectations on the progression of that over the next year or 2? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. It feels like the ground hog day speech, Darrin, we give on the major oils. It's has been way slower, I'd say, than we thought. And good news, bad news, way harder to get set up, to get through all the regs and the tax stuff and the IT and people. So the bad news is it's been more complicated, and thus we're slower kind of out of the block selling it and getting going. I think the good news is that, that's just timing, that our view still of the opportunity to have that kind of a unique offer that's obviously taken over the United States. I'd say, we're still real bullish on the long-term impact of that, and we're just going to stay patient and keep pushing and keep reporting back how we're doing with it. 
Operator: Thank you. This concludes tonight's conference. Thank you for your participation, and you may disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2015 Q3  (2015-11-04 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the FleetCor Technologies Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. 
  It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Eric Dey, CFO of FleetCor Technologies. Mr. Dey, you may begin. 
Eric R. Dey: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 
  By now, everyone should have access to our third quarter press release. It can be found at www.fleetcor.com under the Investor Relations section. 
  Throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share.  This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than other companies' similarly titled non-GAAP information.  Quantitative reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today's press release and on our website, as previously described.  Also, we are providing 2015 guidance on a non-GAAP basis. 
  Finally, before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements. This may include forward-looking statements about our 2015 guidance, new products and fee initiatives and expectations regarding business development and acquisitions.
  They are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore, you should not put undue reliance on them. These results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.  Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release.  Others  are described in our annual report on Form 10-K. These documents are available on our website, as previously discussed, and at www.sec.gov. 
  With our  disclosures out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay,  Eric. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. And as always, thanks for joining the call today. 
  Upfront here, I'm going to plan  to cover just 2 subjects. First, I'll provide a little color on Q3; and then second, I'll comment on our full year 2015 guidance. 
  Okay, so on to the quarter. We reported Q3 revenue of $451 million,  up 53%, and $1.67  in cash EPS, up 22%.  So 53% top line, 22% bottom line. Included in the $1.67 of reported cash EPS was approximately $0.06 to $0.07  net tax favorability, which implies $1.61 without the tax benefit.  As a reminder, we did guide to $1.61 for the quarter when we last reported. 
  Fundamentals were quite good in Q3. Organic revenue growth of 9% on a constant like-for-like basis, excluding SVS.  The environment was essentially neutral against our last reported guidance, with above average spreads effectively neutralizing low fuel  prices and weak FX. 
  Of course, when you look at the macro environment against the prior year, it was quite challenging, giving us an overall  negative impact estimated at $0.28 for the quarter. So that obviously would reduce our cash EPS profit  growth from a like-for-like rate of 42% to our reported EPS growth rate of 22%. So continues to be quite challenging. 
  The story of the quarter is really  summarized in 3 themes. So first off, our spread-based  businesses, which  would include CFN and Fuelman  for example, were up significantly in the quarter on wide spreads. And that helped neutralize our fuel price-sensitive businesses  like MasterCard and our U.S. partner portfolios, which were negatively impacted by lower fuel prices. 
  Second, our 2 largest Comdata businesses  performed quite well in the quarter. NAT,  which is our North America Trucking unit, saw its gallons expand 6% in the quarter, which is partially the result of the step-up  in new sales investment we've made. And the Comdata corporate payments grew  revenue 18% in the quarter, that's excluding health care, and also had a terrific sales quarter. Those implementations should really help volume in 2016. 
  And kind of the last theme. As always, some of our other businesses had good growth in Q3. Again, CLC was up 16% in the quarter.  NexTraq, which is our U.S. telematics business, up 12% in the quarter. And our Shell Europe outsourcing business was way up versus last year, as we expanded the number of Shell markets served to 5. 
  Also, in Q3, we had a number of other pretty significant accomplishments. So first off, we're delighted that we've extended our commercial card agreement with BP U.S. So this represents the second renewal of that relationship and are really happy to be able to continue servicing BP for years to come. 
  Second, we actually extended our Shell Europe relationship in the quarter. So Shell agreed to provide us with some additional small cross-border accounts, think accounts that go between countries to fuel. So this expansion increases the overall client count and the overall volume of that outsourcing assignment. 
  Third, we appointed 2  new executives to lead our 2 biggest Comdata businesses;  and both of those guys have, what we think, is the right experience to help accelerate growth there. 
  And lastly, Uber keeps growing. Uber's September volume was up 4x versus June, and our early estimates for 2016 are to see Uber volume more than double versus  this year. So some exciting things. 
  So look, in summary, Q3 was a very good quarter basically on our prior guidance and a lot of progress against our strategic initiatives. 
  Okay, let me move on to our full year 2015 guidance. We are maintaining our cash EPS guidance for full year 2015 at $6.22 at  the midpoint, and the math goes something like this.  Last time, we have guided to $1.61 in Q3 and $1.68 in Q4, totaling $6.22 full year 2015.  Today, we're reporting $1.67 in Q3, outlooking  $1.62 in Q4, so again, totaling $6.22 full year 2015. 
  The 2 unusual impacts to the second half guidance are  a happy $0.06 to $0.07 this quarter from the net tax favorability and a negative approximately $0.06 expected in Q4 from the continuing lower fuel prices and weak FX versus the last time  we reported. 
  So look, the operating fundamentals of the business are quite similar to when we spoke last time, with the exception of these 2 unusual items, a plus and a minus here in the second half. 
  So with that, let me turn the call back over to Eric. He'll provide some additional detail on the quarter and our full year outlook. Eric? 
Eric R. Dey: Thank you, Ron. 
  For the third quarter of 2015, we reported revenue of $451.5 million, an increase of 52.9% from the third quarter of 2014. 
  The revenue from our North American segment increased 114.2% to $334.9 million from $156.3 million in the third quarter of 2014.  Included in the third quarter results was the impact of Comdata, which was acquired on November 14, 2014. 
  Revenue from our International segment decreased 16.1% to $116.5 million from $138.9 million in the third quarter of 2014. 
  For the third quarter of  2015, GAAP net income increased 22.3% to $116.8 million or $1.24 per diluted share from $95.5 million or $1.11 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2014. 
  The other financial metrics that we routinely use are adjusted revenues and adjusted net income, which we sometimes also refer to as cash net income or cash EPS.  Adjusted revenues equal our GAAP revenues, less merchant commissions. We use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate the company's revenues, net of the commissions that are paid to merchants who participate in certain card programs. 
  We prepare adjusted net income to eliminate the effects of noncash items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance. 
  A reconciliation of adjusted revenues and adjusted net income to GAAP numbers are provided in Exhibit 1 of our press release. 
  Adjusted revenues in the third quarter of 2015 increased 55.3% to $419.8 million compared to $270.3 million in the third quarter of 2014. 
  Adjusted net income for the third quarter of 2015 increased 34% to $157.6 million or $1.67 per diluted share compared to $117.6 million or $1.37 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2014. 
  Elements of the macroeconomic environment had a significant impact on our results in the third quarter, specifically market fuel spread margins, fuel prices and foreign exchange rates. 
  In the aggregate, we estimated that these macroeconomic items negatively impacted our business in the third quarter of 2015 versus the third quarter of 2014 by approximately $47 million in adjusted revenue or approximately $0.28 in adjusted net income per diluted share. 
  On a constant currency fuel price and market spread margin basis, we would have reported approximately $1.95 in adjusted net income per diluted share in the third quarter of 2015 compared to $1.37 in the third quarter of 2014 or a growth rate of approximately 42%. 
  Changes in foreign exchange rates were unfavorable in all geographies for the quarter, and overall, we believe negatively impacted adjusted revenues during the quarter by approximately $27 million. 
  Fuel prices also decreased during the quarter versus prior year, which were partially offset by favorable fuel spread margins.  And although we cannot precisely calculate the impact of these changes, we believe they negatively impacted adjusted revenues by approximately $20 million. 
  To better understand the organic growth for the quarter, we calculated revenues using constant currency, fuel price and market spread margins. 
  Based on these criteria, we estimate that we would have reported an approximately 9% organic growth rate for the quarter, excluding the SVS business, and approximately 7% on a consolidated basis. 
  For the third quarter of 2015, transaction volumes increased 342% to 417.1 million transactions compared to 94.4 million transactions in the third quarter of 2014. The increase in total transactions was primarily due to the acquisition of Comdata on November 14, 2014, and also organic growth in our businesses. 
  Excluding the impact of Comdata, our transaction volumes were 98 million in the third quarter of 2015 compared to 94.4 million transactions last year or a growth rate of approximately  4%. 
  North America segment transactions grew 721%,  driven primarily by the acquisition of Comdata and also organic growth in our U.S. businesses.
   Transaction volumes in our International segment were down approximately 7% at 45.6 million transactions.  Transaction volumes in the International segment were impacted primarily by market softness in some of the international businesses. 
  For discussion on revenue per transaction, we will exclude the impact of the SVS business, which had approximately 274 million transactions in the quarter at a very low revenue per transaction. 
  Revenue per transaction for the third quarter of 2015, excluding the SVS business, decreased 11% to $2.78 from $3.13 in the third quarter of 2014. 
  Revenue per transaction can vary based on the geography, the relevant merchant and customer relationship, the payment product utilized and the types of products or services purchased.  The revenue mix was influenced by our acquisitions, organic growth in the business and fluctuations in the macroeconomic environment, as previously discussed.  
  Revenue per transaction, excluding SVS, decreased approximately 16% in North America, due primarily to lower fuel prices during the quarter versus the prior year quarter, partially offset by slightly higher spread margins during the quarter. 
  In the International segment, revenue per transaction decreased 9.6%, due primarily to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates across all of our geographies. This unfavorable impact was partially offset by organic revenue growth in several lines of business. 
  Now let's shift over and discuss some of the other drivers of third quarter performance. For our North American segment, most of our lines of business performed well.  On a constant currency, fuel spread and fuel price basis, we estimate that organic growth rate in the quarter was approximately 14%, excluding the impact of Comdata acquisition. 
  Some of the positive drivers in North America revenue during the quarter were similar to the last several quarters, including the exceptional performance of our MasterCard product, which had estimated revenue growth of approximately 33% over the third quarter of 2014, measured in constant fuel price.  The growth in MasterCard was driven by increases in both transactions and revenue per transaction measured on a constant fuel price basis. 
  CLC had another solid quarter with 16% revenue growth over the third quarter of 2014. This revenue growth was driven primarily by increases in our CheckINN Direct product, which target smaller accounts. 
  As I mentioned earlier, the macroeconomic environment was mixed. Slightly favorable fuel spread margins in the quarter versus the third quarter of 2014 partially offset the impact of lower fuel prices during the quarter.  In total, we believe these items negatively impacted adjusted revenues by approximately $20 million.  And finally, the third quarter also benefited from our acquisition of Comdata. 
  Our Comdata business, excluding SVS, performed well in the quarter and had an organic growth rate of approximately 8% on a constant fuel price basis versus prior year. 
  As I mentioned last year, the Comdata organic growth rate in 2015 was impacted by lower RFID sales in our trucking business and higher opt-out  rates in the health care segment. 
  Also, as I mentioned earlier, International segment revenue was down approximately 16% in the third quarter of 2015 versus the third quarter of 2014. This decrease was driven primarily by unfavorable foreign exchange rates in all geographies, which negatively impacted adjusted revenues by approximately $27 million in the quarter versus last year.  On a constant currency and fuel price basis, organic growth was approximately 4% for the third quarter. 
  Some of the international highlights for the quarter include the continued conversion of the Shell small business portfolio. We are now in a total of 5 European markets, Germany, Austria, Netherlands, France and Belgium, with the plan to  convert 2 additional new markets in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
  Our Mexico business continued to perform well and posted double-digit gains, and on the downside, the economies in Brazil and Russia continue  to struggle and are impacting volumes in those markets. 
  Now moving down the income statement. Total operating expenses for the third quarter were $263 million compared to $151.1 million in the third quarter of 2014, an increase of 74.1%. 
  As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses increased to 58.3% of revenue compared to 51.2% in the third quarter of 2014.
   Included in operating expenses are merchant commissions, processing expenses, bad debt, selling and general administrative expense, depreciation and amortization expense and other operating net.
   Included in the third quarter of 2015 operating expense were additional operating expenses and significant additional amortization expense related to the acquisition of Comdata.
   In addition, noncash stock compensation included in general and administrative  expense was $13.9 million in the third quarter of 2015 compared to $8 million in the third quarter last year. 
  Credit losses were $5.3 million for the quarter or approximately 3 basis points compared to $5.8 million or 12 basis points in the third quarter of 2014.  The 9 basis point decrease in bad debt was due primarily to the inclusion of Comdata in the quarter, which had bad debt as a percentage of its billed revenue significantly below the FleetCor  average and lower bad debt in our Russia business compared to last year. 
  Depreciation and amortization expense increased 88.7% to $48.5 million in the third quarter of 2015 from $25.7 million in the third quarter of 2014. The increase was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets related to the Comdata acquisition. 
  Also, the company booked a loss of $6.1 million in the third quarter of 2015 related to our minority investment in Masternaut compared to a loss of $2.2 million in the third quarter of 2014.  The additional loss is partially due to the impact of restructuring the operations of the business. 
  Interest expense increased 253% to $17.2 million in the third quarter of 2015 from $4.9 million in the third quarter of 2014. The increase in interest expense was due primarily to additional borrowings to finance the Comdata acquisition. 
  Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2015 was 29.4% compared to 30.1% for the third quarter of 2014. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due primarily to favorable net tax adjustments related to U.S. planning initiatives that were implemented during the third quarter. The net impact of those adjustments, which involve amending tax returns for several prior years, was approximately $0.06 to $0.07 in adjusted net income per diluted share. 
  We expect that the income from this planning initiative will have a favorable impact on tax rates in future years.  Partially offsetting the impact of this positive impact was the inclusion of the Comdata business, which operates primarily in the U.S., with a higher overall tax rate versus the average FleetCor  rate. 
  Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $551.8  million in total cash. Approximately $125.4 million is restricted and are primarily customer deposits. 
  As of September 30, 2015, we had approximately $1,944,000,000  outstanding on our Term A loan, $248 million outstanding on our Term B loan and approximately $235 million drawn on our revolver, leaving approximately $800 million of undrawn availability.  We also had approximately $665 million borrowed against our securitization facility. 
  As of September 30, 2015, our leverage ratio was 2.49x EBITDA,  down from 2.69x  in the second quarter, which is well below our covenant level of 4.25x EBITDA. 
   We intend to continue to use our free cash flow to temporarily pay down the balance on the revolving credit facility and securitization facility and maintain  liquidity for acquisitions and other corporate purposes.
   Finally, we are not a capital-intensive business and we spent only $13.3 million on CapEx during the third quarter of 2015. 
  Now onto our outlook for the remainder of 2015. Our fiscal 2015 guidance assumes that the impact of declining  fuel prices and foreign exchange rates will continue in the fourth quarter and provide an additional unfavorable impact of approximately $0.05 to $0.07 in adjusted net income per diluted share versus the guidance we provided on the second quarter earnings call. We expect that the negative impact of the macroeconomic environment will offset the impact of our approximate $0.06 beat in the third quarter versus  the guidance we previously provided. 
  As a result, we are maintaining the full year adjusted net income per diluted share guidance  provided on the second quarter's earnings call. 
  For fiscal 2015, our financial guidance and assumptions are as follows: total revenues between $1,680,000,000 and $1,720,000,000; adjusted net income between the $580 million and $590 million; and adjusted net income per diluted share between $6.18 and $6.26.
   The company's fiscal year guidance assumptions for 2015 are as follows: weighted average fuel price of approximately $2.45 for the fourth quarter in the U.S. compared to $3.30 per gallon average in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2014, down approximately 25%; market spreads lower in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014.  As a reminder, spread levels in the fourth quarter of 2014 were at record levels. 
  Foreign exchange rates equal to the October 1 through October 12 average, a negative impact to adjusted revenue of approximately $15 million to $18 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. 
  We are including the SVS business for the remainder of the year; fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately 94.3 million shares; a full year tax rate of approximately 31.5% to 32%; and as always, no impact related to acquisitions or material new partnership agreements not already disclosed. 
  Our adjusted net income per diluted share guidance at the midpoint of the range represents an approximately 21% growth rate over the $5.15 in adjusted net income per diluted share reported in 2014.
   And with that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Ramsey El-Assal from Jefferies. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Wanted to just -- and I may have missed this. But in the fourth quarter specifically, the beat is not flowing through, obviously, to the full year largely because of the macro headwinds, but there's no incremental caution in any part of your business. It's basically just the macro that is preventing the top  line this quarter from flowing through to the full year. 
Eric R. Dey: Correct. 
Ronald F. Clarke: That is the assumption, Ramsey 
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay, great. And it sounds also like some of the top line beat didn't necessarily flow all the way through to EPS. Obviously, there was the  tax benefit in there, but excluding that, you called out some higher expenses related to Comdata. I mean, are these -- will we see your sort of operating margins kind of revert to more normal levels going forward? Was most of the incremental expense in the quarter kind of fleeting in nature? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Ramsey, it's Ron. I'd say 2 things. One, we had $1 million or $2 million what we call kind of one-time, on-budget in expenses, deal-related things, bonus things,  things like that. And then two, we have a JV telematics and called Masternaut that  kind of performed worse for us. So I'd say  those are the 2 negatives basically underneath  revenue. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay, got it. And then lastly for me. On SVS, are you -- can you update us on your sort of your long-term plans for that subsidiary? I know you got the ADP JV structured there. I was wondering if there's any update in terms of divesting the asset, keeping it in the company longer term, or what are your thoughts there? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, we're still working on this other alternative  we mentioned in the last call. And I'd say, certainly by the time we talk next, we'll either  land that plane or not. I'd also say that the couple of interested buyers appear to continue to be interested. They continue to call. So I'd say our hope is to proceed on this basis  that we've been going, but I'd say we'd have a definitive answer next time around. 
Operator: Our next question today is coming from Sanjay Sakhrani  from KBW. 
Steven Kwok: This is actually Steven Kwok filling in for Sanjay.  I guess, first question is just around the health care vertical. One  of your public peers have been acquiring other companies within the space. I just wanted to see if you could provide some color around the competitive dynamics. And then additionally, I believe, last time, you called out that there was an account that you could potentially get back, and just wanted to get an update around that account. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, it's Ron. Let me take the second one first. We did call out, I think, in the first quarter  report that an account had  dropped off.  We've gotten confirmation that, that account plans to come back, which is good news. I'd  say it's still not clear to us when exactly we'll start to book more revenue, but we have been advised that they plan to come back online. 
Eric R. Dey: Which is good news. 
Ronald F. Clarke: And the second question was around WEX's health care. Was that the question? 
Steven Kwok: Yes, and just around the competitive nature of the health care segment. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Again, I'd say that we would not run into WEX generally in terms of the health care segment that we're  focused on. Again, the Evolution1  really does very different things than our line of business. I would say that competitively, we're bidding against other treasury banks fundamentally in the health care segment that we're attacking. 
Operator: Our next question today is coming from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. 
James Schneider: I guess, the first one I would have is, in terms of the revenue per transaction increase in Q3, was that all down to higher spreads, or was there also the impact of pricing and Comdata or some other part of business? 
Eric R. Dey: Jim, this is Eric. Well, first, the revenue per tran in the third quarter was actually down on a reported basis.  So I'm not exactly sure what you're looking for. If you exclude the impact of the macro environment and you exclude the acquisitions as an example last year, then revenue per tran was actually up. So the way we calculate it, again, excluding the macro and excluding Comdata,  revenue  per tran on a consolidated basis was around $3.41 compared to around $3.10 last year. So it was up. 
James Schneider: Yes, I was just talking about North America, excuse me. Okay. Maybe I'll take that one off-line, but as a follow-up, maybe you could provide a little bit of an update on kind of where the landscape stands with the M&A environment in Europe and whether you thinks that's kind of any closer to getting fruition outside of your Shell deal where obviously you performed very well? 
Ronald F. Clarke: So you, Jim, on partners, or you're on acquisitions? 
James Schneider: Both actually,  if you can provide an update on both ends of it. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. So on the first one, I think I feel like we're replaying a tape, but the answer is there are a couple of oil partners in Europe that are actively looking, RFI-ing,  if you will, processing and/or outsourcing agreements. So although we say we're hopeful in terms of time, our guess is that at least one or the other will make some kind of a decision in 2016. So we are, as you can imagine, in the couple of processes and hopeful that they'll make some decision. On the deal side, we remain busy. We're  in a much better place than, let's say, 6 months ago, our -- got leverage penciled out  about 2.5x. 
Eric R. Dey: 2.49. 
Ronald F. Clarke: We've got some people in Comdata. We've done most of the integration work we want to do there. So we've got 3 or 4 things that are active that we are on now, one of which I'd say is pretty late innings. So I'm hopeful that we will provide some news to you guys shortly here. 
James Schneider: That's helpful. And then just to clarify my comment before, what I was talking about revenue per transaction stepping up I meant from Q2 to Q3 in North America, so from $0.73 to $0.90. That's  what I was asking about. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I think both of those things that you said directionally are right, Jim. One, clearly, the per-tran grows  when you have a good spread quarter like we did in Q3; and your second comment is also  right that some of the price recovery things that we did earlier in the year have come kind of fruition. And so we're kind of getting all of the benefit or most of the benefit of those now as you run through Q3. So I'd say both of those statements are right. 
Operator: Our next question today is coming from Phil Stiller from Citi. 
Philip Stiller: I just wanted to ask about international business. So the transaction growth decelerated a bit. I think, Eric, you said the organic revenue growth was about 4% in the quarter. Just wondering how you guys were thinking about that on a go-forward  basis. I know some of your businesses  there are struggling with the economy, but just wondering how you guys think about that as we progress over the next few quarters? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes. I mean, certainly, there's a lot of puts and takes, Phil. We certainly are getting impacted by places like Brazil. Transaction counts in Brazil were actually down, I don't know, around 10% approximately. But yet our revenue in Brazil was actually flat in local currency, kind of year-over-year. And we're seeing a similar story in Russia where  the economy is causing transactions to effectively step back a little bit. But we're  seeing a lesser impact when we look at the revenue from the business in a constant currency basis. 
Philip Stiller: Okay. And I guess when you guys acquired the Comdata business, you talked about getting that to a 10% growth rate. It's certainly tracking towards that, but not there yet. But just wanted to get an update on your confidence getting to that level. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Phil.  It's Ron. I'd say that we've just provided a Q4 forecast update, and sitting inside that it's an expectation that both of the big businesses, the trucking business and the corporate payments business, will be at that or above that. So that's kind of in this quarter's forecast. So I'd say that other than that little surprise we had back in Q1, I think our message is that things are going better outside of the health care slowdown that we had. I think it's tracking to what we thought. And sales were up. I think I mentioned in my opening that the Q3 corporate payments was literally an all-time record sales quarter, which doesn't  give us any revenue in the quarter they sell it because it's  4 to 6 months implementation.  But when you're selling in a lot, you're going to get revenue a different day. So I'd say that both in the trucking business, where we've added  50 people, and in corporate payments, where we've added a bunch, we're seeing the early signs of the sales stepping up, which is really bodes well for next year. 
Philip Stiller: Good to hear. Last one, somewhat related topic.  Maybe we could get your comments on the EFS WEX transaction,  what that might mean for you guys strategically either  from a product -- competitive perspective or pricing, that'd  be great. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I'm not sure we would have much to say in terms of whether our view of the WEX owning  it does something or doesn't do something to the business. I'd say that we know the business well, Phil. We diligence the business pretty hard when it  was being sold. And  we obviously had a chance to buy that business.  And not to gloat, but we think we bought the better business, which we did purposely. So I'd say we'd wait and see. We're kind of happy with,  again, how our trucking business is competing and growing now, and we'll, I guess, stay tuned  to what they might do that would be different. 
Operator: Our next question today is coming from Ashish Sabadra  from Deutsche Bank. 
Ashish Sabadra: So on the North America, we saw the organic growth improve compared to the second quarter. Looks like CLC also showed improvement and then MasterCard universal  product is delivering pretty solid growth. Just wanted to see if there are any kind of events there that you would like to highlight, what's driving the improvement in North America? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes, Ashish. This is Eric. It's just more of  the same stuff. I mean, in all honesty, it really is  the MasterCard portfolio continues to perform well as we called out on the call growing around 30% organically on a constant fuel price basis. And CLC continues to do well, and we had some small partner wins prior year. We're seeing some more  revenue from those things as we get into this year. So it's just really a combination of all those things that just continued into the third quarter. So really, it was -- as Ron indicated, it was a pretty good quarter for us. 
Ashish Sabadra: That's great. That's great. I was wondering if you can just provide what the Comdata  revenue was in the quarter. 
Eric R. Dey: Ashish, we don't disclose that specifically. I mean, that's one of our businesses.  We got lots of businesses around the world, so we don't want to talk about individual businesses. 
Ashish Sabadra: No worries. And then quickly on the expense -- a follow-up on the expense side. So Ron mentioned a couple of expense items. So when I was looking on the individual  line item, I saw the processing expenses were a bit high in  third quarter. Any particular call-outs there? 
Eric R. Dey: No, it's just more, again, business as usual. We are -- we do have Comdata this year. We didn't have Comdata last year. So again, all of those expenses, the increase in the expense is really related to owning that business this year versus last. With the exception of that, there really is no unusual item in the quarter versus last year other than the couple  million, again, that Ron called out, but those were in a number of different lines versus just one. 
Operator: Our next question today is coming from David Togut  from Evercore ISI. 
David Togut: The 33% direct MasterCard growth was very strong. Could you break down  the underlying unit growth at constant  macro factors versus  any pricing increases you implemented? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, David.  It's Ron. It was high teens for the quarter. 
David Togut: High-teens  unit volume growth? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Correct. 
David Togut: Great. And then where do you stand with that product? I think  before you've said you're in the early innings. Do you still think you have a long runway for that product? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Well, I mean, I just call out the growth rate, but I think we said when we introduced that product, whatever, 5 years ago, that finally our company got a product that can work in every geography and basically for every size account. And so it's taken us  a long time to build up the sales and distribution system to kind of chase that whole market. So I'd say that, yes, we've done an early look at our 2016 plans. And I'd say we are bullish again next year on the thing. So plenty of runway still. 
David Togut: Great. And then just shifting gears to Shell. You called out an expansion of that relationship to pick up cross-border. Can you dimension for us how big that incremental revenue might be on an annual basis and then where you might stand with the expansion of that relationship further, perhaps, into the larger fleet portion of the fuel card portfolio at Shell? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. So the first part, I'd frame it kind of 10% to 20%. So again, to be specific, if you went into, let's say, Germany, Shell transferred x number of accounts and y number of leaders to us and then have decided, "Hey, look, there's some other small accounts there that go cross-border. We might as well give those to FleetCor." So that'll add, call it, 10% or 20% kind of volume and revenue to the original  assignment. And I'd say on the second one, Shell is from the show-me state,  they're going to want to see us finish these other markets. I think Eric mentioned in his comments, our plan is  to put 2 more markets live to bringing the thing to 7 and then finishing that up in the first quarter. So they a, they want us to, I'm sure, complete, David, the initial assignment; b, show some progress in selling in these markets. And to the extent that we do those 2 things well, my sense is they would be inclined to do more with us. But I'd say it's probably into the middle of next year would be my guess. 
David Togut: Got it. And then staying on Europe, you've announced earlier the rollout of a universal  fuel card for Europe along the same sort of geographic footprint as Shell. Where do you stand with the rollout of that? And when might that be material to revenue? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I'd say that is proven not quite as slow and difficult as Europe outsourcing agreements. But the patchwork  of markets and the taxation, we've done a lot of rework in the kitchen, I'd say, on the product, trying to get the thing right. We have another launch, I think, towards the end of this month that we think finally has it right. And the same in sales. We have been trying to split the sales commitment we have to Shell versus this universal product and kind of tend to Shell first. So I'd say that we're progressing, but I'd say slower than we've hoped. I mean, with that said, I think you're an advocate  like we are, we still think that, just like the U.S., that, that product -- if we can get it dialed in right has just enormous potential because it would be a one-of-a-kind  fundamentally on that continent. There is no other control card that works everywhere that we are aware of. And so difficult kind of getting out of the test kitchen, but I'd say we remain incredibly excited about the thing over the midterm. 
David Togut: Would that product be interchange-based pricing or would you go a different route, given the interchange caps coming next month in Europe? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, it would be both. Again,  I think the commercial piece, the way we're doing it would be fundamentally protected,  but we have some other as normal ideas of how to get paid on that product. So I'd say the chase for us is customers, David. Our game is to figure out how to build a distribution pipe to sign up accounts, and we know how to make money. So I think the answer is we're chasing accounts first. 
David Togut: Got it. Quick last question on telematics. You've said in the last 6 to 9 months you're evaluating what you do strategically in that business. What are your latest thoughts? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, that's actually a pretty good question. I'd say that a couple of things. One, I'd say that the business, as we gotten to  know it better, is actually a better business than I think we thought. We bought this business that's actually here in town in Atlanta. I think, I don't have it in  front of me, but I think the profits will be up about 4x this year versus the year we bought it. And I think I mentioned the  growth rate is double digit, and the early plan we have for next year is double digit. So the first comment is I think we like the -- at least the U.S. telematics business in category a bit more maybe than  we thought. And I'd say we're probably slightly less optimistic about the FleetCor benefit. So we've spent about a year trying to cross-sell and use our clients and salespeople, fuel card people, to try to boost telematics, and it's working. But I'd say, David, call it 1/3 or 1/2 of what we expected it could add. So it's obviously  still helping the business, but not helping it as much. So we actually had a review  this with the board, and I'd say our conclusion as is that we're in less of a rush now. We like the space a little more than maybe we thought, and it's working but not quite as much. So I'd say we're going to kind of hang in at least another year and get a sense of whether we like it a little or a lot. 
Operator: Our next question is coming from Tim Willi from Wells Fargo. 
Timothy Willi: Two questions. First on International, with the decline in the transaction growth that you attributed  to Russia and Brazil, just within those 2 regions. As you went through the quarter and, obviously, through October, had the trajectory in the year-over-year transaction metrics flattened out? Or did you see it continue to sort of worsen  as you went through the quarter, just to get a feel for where we might be with those 2 regions? 
Eric R. Dey: Tim,  this is Eric. I would say, if you look back and look at the United States back when we were in recession a number of years ago, I would say there's  a lot of similarities to what we're seeing in both Russia and Brazil. Their economies have kind of slowed down. They've got negative GDP growth and that is kind of impacted  transaction volumes really to a very similar degree to what we saw in the United States back in, like, 2008 and 2009. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Tim.  It's Ron. Let me maybe just add something to what Eric said. I mean, the economy, obviously,  the GDP in those 2 countries is not good. But we're remembering workforce payments. So if you take Brazil, a big part of our business there is food cards and a big part of our business is transporter,  commuter cards, which are tax-advantaged products for employees. And so not only does the economy shrink, there's less employment, but there's less formal employment. So remember, our products require employers to formally have the guy on the payroll to make these products work. And so our analysis is showing that not only are we kind of dropping in a bit with the general economy, but the formal employment thing is actually kind of heading back the other way as people, employers struggle. And  so the softness that Eric refers to in those 2 particular places is quite large in our lines of business. And we're selling a lot. I mean, the thing that's so weird about it is, we've created a bunch of new products, particularly in Brazil, and we're starting to sell  a decent amount of them, but the softness is  so great. We're barely getting back to where we started, and so that's the challenge there. 
Timothy Willi: Okay, great. Appreciate that. And then second question I have is just around the corporate payment. You talked about nice very strong quarter of sales. I guess now that you had that business almost a year  officially and obviously knew it prior to the actual acquisition announcement, any thoughts or -- a, around the selling process to get where you're at, where you had a great quarter just what was learned,  is there a new approach? Or is there some stuff you've done around the product and the platform that's aided  those efforts outside of just adding bodies? And then if I could just add on to that, around that business  overall, what  are your thoughts  around what you hear from the networks about maybe providing you some tailwinds around corporate payments? They talk  about it periodically, but you're a bit closer to it at the ground level. Anything  interesting going on there that might present tailwind for that business over the next several years? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, so let me, Tim, go to the first one first. I'd say not so much on are we doing a lot to the product. I'd say that Comdata had a very good corporate payments product when we bought the company, which is one of our motives. I'd say what we've done is a lot around the targeting, so who to sell it to, and a lot around the sales force investment and marketing investment to try to sell more. So I'd say that the success in the quarter is really around marketing and selling more than some big product enhancement. And around  the networks, I'd say, obviously, Visa has got a real interest even though we're with MasterCard, and MasterCard's incredibly helpful in pushing and providing leads and talking that up right as a way to get more card-based  payments. And so they've been a very, very good partner  to Comdata  in terms of helping us grow. 
Operator: Our next call is coming Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: I guess, I'll ask on the -- like Tim asked, but for the United States. How healthy are the fleets in general? Any  change in  same-store or just activity? 
Eric R. Dey: Tien-tsin, this is Eric. Yes, I would say,  when you look at it at a consolidated basis, so you look at all of our products, our same-store sales are actually up a little bit, probably up  around 1%. But when you break it down specifically and look at some individual businesses,  like specifically, maybe, Fuelman, which is our small to midsize customer product, which is more geographically focused, you would see a little more kind of same-store sales impact in those markets, because that product is kind of centered more in Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma. So you're seeing some impact there from kind of oil and gas, as an example, and maybe even some smaller trucking clients. But then when you shift over and look at businesses  like Comdata, Comdata same-store sales are actually up a little bit. So again, I think it kind of varies by product. But when you look at our business at a consolidated level, I'd say we're flat to up a little bit. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: That's good to know. And then just on the acquisition front, it sounds like you do have one that's getting close to the finish here. But just how has valuation been trending?  Because it seems like there's more activity around corporate payments. You've seen, obviously, some larger  deals as well. So where are we on the valuation side with M&A? Has it changed your appetite in any way? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Tien-tsin, it's Ron. I think it probably has drifted up a bit with the cost of capital still. And so I'd say for us, we say this all the time, we really look at the year one plans for these deals, and we don't buy things that don't look  like a decent price to us kind of 1 year out. So that's really the benchmark. So I'd say to you that if we can't find a transaction where we like that multiple over the next 12 months,  we generally don't go ahead. So we've obviously looked  at some fair number of things since Comdata and have not pulled the trigger. But as I mentioned, we do have active  things and one of them is pretty late. So that's always the call of for as is whether the guy wants the team dime trailing, our question is just what it is forward. And if we like the year 1 in the mid-term forward rate, we buy the thing. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Okay. No, I know you're disciplined. Just last one, I'll jump off. Just on the Comdata synergy front, with the -- on the cost side, how is that tracking versus plan? 
Eric R. Dey: I would say we're pretty much where we had expected to be. So most of the cost savings and the revenue synergies that we thought we are going to obtain are kind of in the run rate, Tien-tsin. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I'd add, Tien-tsin. The only add to Eric's is I'd say there is a little more room in the IT. I think we mentioned this when we did the transaction that there were some stuff we did at the close. There'd be some  stuff kind of along the way and the longer pole would be IT. So as we've started to look at our budgets for 2016, I'd say there's still probably a little bit of wind left in lower IT. 
Operator: That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.

===== 2015 Q2  (2015-08-05 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the FleetCor Technologies, Inc. Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]
 At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Eric Dey, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead. 
Eric R. Dey: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. By now, everyone should have access to our second quarter press release. It can be found at www.fleetcor.com under the Investor Relations section. 
 Throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than other companies' similarly titled non-GAAP information. 
 Quantitative reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today's press release and on our website as previously described. 
 Also, we are providing 2015 guidance on a non-GAAP basis. 
 Finally, before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements. This includes forward-looking statements about our 2015 guidance, new products and fee initiatives, and expectations regarding business development and acquisitions. They are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore you should not put undue reliance on them. These results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Others described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. These documents are available on our website as previously discussed and at www.sec.gov.  
 With our standard disclosures out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay, Eric. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone, and appreciate you joining the call today. Upfront here, I'm going to plan to cover 3 subjects: First, I'll comment on Q2; second, I'll provide a bit of an update on SVS; and then third, I'll talk about the second half and our raise in full year 2015 guidance. 
 Okay. So onto Q2. We reported Q2 revenue of $405 million, up 48%, and cash EPS of $148 million, up 16%. So 48% top line, 16% bottom line. 
 The quarter finished a few cents better than our expectations, but that was primarily because we got a little help from higher fuel prices in the quarter, at least higher than our internal plan. But when you look at the macroenvironment versus the prior year, it's actually quite negative. We estimate that unfavorable FX and lower fuel prices negatively impacted our Q2 cash EPS by approximately $0.28 a share. I'm not a big fan of could have, would have, should have stuff, but our cash EPS would have been $1.76 versus the $1.48 we reported, up 39% on a constant like-for-like basis. 
 Let's look at the 4 drivers of our growth in Q2. So first off, our high-growth businesses continue to perform well. Our direct MasterCard business grew 30%. That's on a constant fuel price. Our CLC business was up 13%, and our Mexico business was up 14% in local currency. So good performance across those 3 businesses. 
 Two, our new oil partner wins delivered some incremental revenue in the quarter. First off, our Chevron Asia and Caltex Australia new processing relationships began to generate some revenue. Our Husky and Ultramar relationships in Canada continued to build and add volume and revenue. And our Shell Europe outsourcing program was extended in the 3 additional countries in the quarter, bringing our total country count to 5. So some good progress with new oil partners. 
 Third, a couple of our newer acquisitions performed well in the quarter. Epyx, our maintenance business in the U.K., was up over 30%; and Pac Pride, our card lock business that we acquired last summer, was up 26%. So our new acquisitions doing well. 
 And then the fourth driver of Q2 performance was obviously the addition of Comdata, which continues to make good progress against our 10% organic revenue growth target. 
 So look, overall, our Q2 fundamentals were quite good. Consolidated organic revenue growth, pre-Comdata, at about 10% on a constant like-for-like environmental basis. So again, right around our internal target. 
 We also continued to make new incremental sales investments in the quarter. Since the beginning of the year, we've added 125 net new sales reps globally. That included some big increases in Brazil, Australia, the U.K. and Comdata. So we're continuing to invest in growth. 
 Okay. Let me transition over to SVS. As many of you know, we've been exploring the sale of SVS since earlier this year. We're still in discussions with a few interested buyers, but a new alternative has recently surfaced that we decided to explore. So as a result, we're going to run the process longer and keep SVS in our guidance for the balance of 2015. We'll certainly keep you updated as we progress and as we finalize our decision. 
 So lastly, let me transition over to our views on the second half and our full year 2015 guidance. So we're expecting continued acceleration in earnings in the second half. Our guidance is out looking cash EPS to be up 10% sequentially versus the first half. A number of things, number of initiatives are expected to contribute to the second half performance. 
 So first, further buildup of the Uber program. That thing is off to a terrific start. About 75% of the eligible drivers solicited have signed up for the car ph] program and about 40% have actually activated or started using the card. So great start there. 
 We're finally converting some of our U.K. customers onto our new AllStar 1 chip-and-pin card. So as you may recall, that offers universal acceptance across the entire U.K. and discounts at about 20% of fueling sites. So a product really with the best of both worlds, convenient with discounts and with great fraud protection. So we're excited about that. 
 We've installed some new rate initiatives in Comdata's trucking business, which we'll benefit from in the second half. Our plan is to roll out 2 additional countries in the Shell Europe outsourcing program, which should bring our total country count to 7. And we'll continue the roll of our Pac Pride extended network card, which allows our Pac Pride customers to basically go beyond the Pac Pride sites and create more out-of-network transactions. So a number of these initiatives will help performance in the second half. 
 So lastly, let me cover our thoughts on 2015 guidance. We're raising full year 2015 cash EPS at the midpoint to $6.22 today, so that's up from $6.10 in our last call. So a way to think about the bridge, $6.10 last time and this quarter Q2 printed $1.48, which is kind of $0.02 to $0.03 better than we guided to. Our outlook is for $0.06 of incremental negative FX headwind for the second half. That's on top of what we had already planned. And then again, our plan to retain SVS for Q3 and Q4 will add circa $0.15. So when you add that up it gets to this new guidance of $6.22. 
 So if we're fortunate enough to deliver the $6.22 guidance that would result in a 21% cash EPS increase over last year's $5.15 reported cash EPS. 
 So given all the difficulties in the macroenvironment, we couldn't be more delighted to outlook 5 consecutive years of 20% plus earnings growth since FleetCor went public. So not too bad. 
 So with that, let me turn the call back over to Eric. He'll provide some additional detail on the quarter and on our outlook. Eric? 
Eric R. Dey: [Technical Difficulty]
 For the second quarter of 2015, we reported revenue of $404.6 million, an increase of 48% from the second quarter of 2014. The revenue from our North American segment increased 104.9% to $284.6 million from $138.9 million in the second quarter of 2014. 
 Included in the second quarter results was the impact of Comdata, which was acquired on November 14, 2014. Revenue from our International segment decreased 10.9% to $120 million from $134.6 million in the second quarter of 2014. 
 For the second quarter of 2015, GAAP net income increased 11.4% and $98.7 million or $1.05 per diluted share from $88.5 million or $1.03 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2014. 
 The other financial metrics that we routinely use are adjusted revenues and adjusted net income, which we sometimes also refer to as cash net income or cash EPS. 
 Adjusted revenues equal our GAAP revenues, less merchant commissions. We use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate the company's revenues, net of the commissions that are paid to merchants who participate in certain card programs. A reconciliation of adjusted revenues and adjusted net income to GAAP numbers are provided in Exhibit 1 of our press release. 
 Adjusted revenues in the second quarter of 2015 increased 51% to $382.9 million compared to $253.2 million in the second quarter of 2014. Adjusted net income for the second quarter of 2015 increased 28% to $138.9 million or $1.48 per diluted share compared to $108.9 million or $1.27 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2014. 
 Elements of the macroeconomic environment had a significant impact on our results in the second quarter, specifically market fuel spread margins, fuel prices and foreign exchange rates. In the aggregate, we estimated that these macroeconomic items negatively impacted our business in the second quarter of 2015 versus the second quarter of 2014 by approximately $47 million in adjusted revenue or approximately $0.28 in adjusted net income per diluted share. 
 On a constant currency fuel price and market spread margin basis, we would have reported approximately $1.76 in adjusted net income per diluted share in the second quarter of 2015 compared to $1.27 in the second quarter of 2014 or a growth rate of approximately 39%. 
 Changes in foreign exchange rates were unfavorable in all geographies for the quarter. And overall, we believe negatively impacted adjusted revenues during the quarter by approximately $24 million. Fuel prices also decreased during the quarter versus prior year, which were partially offset by favorable fuel spread margins. And although we cannot precisely calculate the impact of these changes, we believe they negatively impacted adjusted revenues by approximately $23 million. 
 To better understand the organic growth for the quarter, we calculated revenues using constant currency, fuel price and market spread margins. Based on these criteria, we would have reported an approximately 10% organic growth rate for the quarter, excluding the Comdata business, and approximately 8% on a consolidated basis. 
 For the second quarter of 2015, transaction volumes increased 382% to 435.1 million transactions compared to 90.2 million transactions in the second quarter of 2014. The increase in total transactions was primarily due to the acquisition of Comdata on November 14 and also organic growth in our businesses. 
 Excluding the impact of Comdata, our transaction volumes were 94.6 million in the second quarter of 2015 compared to 90.2 million transactions last year or a growth rate of 5%. 
 North America segment transactions grew 812%, driven primarily by the acquisition of Comdata and also organic growth in our U.S. businesses. 
 Transaction volumes in our International segment fell slightly and were down approximately 3.9% to 45.7 million transactions. Transaction volumes in the International segment were impacted primarily by market softness in Russia and Brazil. 
 For a discussion on revenue per transaction, we will exclude the impact of the SVS business, which had approximately 296 million transactions in the quarter at a very low revenue per transaction. 
 Revenue per transaction for the second quarter of 2015, excluding the SVS business, decreased 11.5% to $2.68 from $3.03 in the second quarter of 2014. Revenue per transaction can vary based on the geography, the relevant merchant and customer relationship, the payment product utilized and the types of products or services purchased. The revenue mix was influenced by our acquisitions, organic growth in the business and fluctuations in the macroeconomic environment, as previously discussed. 
 Revenue per transaction decreased 16.6% in North America, due primarily to lower fuel prices during the quarter versus the prior year quarter, partially offset by slightly higher spread margins during the quarter. 
 In the International segment, revenue per transaction decreased 7.2%, due primarily to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates across all of our geographies. This unfavorable impact was partially offset by organic revenue growth in several lines of business. 
 Now let's shift over and discuss some of the other drivers of second quarter performance. For our North American segment, most of our lines of business performed well. On a constant currency, fuel spread and fuel price basis, we reported approximately an 11% organic growth rate in the quarter, excluding the impact of the Comdata acquisition. Some of the positive drivers in the North America revenue during the quarter were similar to the last several quarters, including the exceptional performance of our MasterCard product, which had revenue growth of approximately 30% over the second quarter of 2014 measured in constant fuel price. 
 The increase in revenue was driven primarily by increases in both transactions and revenue per transaction on a constant fuel price basis. 
 The CLC Group, provider of our lodging card programs, had another solid quarter, with 13% revenue growth over the second quarter of 2014. This revenue growth was driven primarily by increases in our CheckINN Direct product, which targets smaller accounts. 
 As I mentioned earlier, the macroeconomic environment was mixed. Slightly favorable fuel spread margins in the quarter versus the second quarter of 2014 positively impacted adjusted revenues for the quarter but was more than offset by the impact of lower fuel prices during the quarter. 
 In total, we believe lower fuel prices negatively impacted adjusted revenues by approximately $23 million. 
 And finally, the second quarter also benefited from our acquisition of Comdata, which closed in November of 2014. Our Comdata business, excluding SVS, performed well in the quarter and had an organic growth rate of approximately 7% on a constant fuel price basis versus prior year. However, as we discussed on last quarter's call, lower RFID sales in our trucking business and higher opt-out rates in the health care segment impacted the organic growth rate in the quarter, and is included in our balance of the year forecast. 
 Organic growth in the International segment was approximately 9% for the quarter measured in constant currency. However, as I mentioned earlier, unfavorable foreign exchange rates in all geographies negatively impacted adjusted revenues by approximately $24 million in the quarter versus last year. 
 Most of our international businesses posted good organic growth rates on a constant currency basis. Some of the highlights for the quarter include the continued successful conversion of the Shell small business portfolio. We are now in a total of 5 European markets: Germany, Austria, Netherlands, France and Belgium, with more to come in the second half of the year. 
 Epyx, our maintenance business in the U.K., was up over 30% in the quarter and constant currency. Our Mexico business performed well and posted double-digit gains. And although Russia volumes remain soft, total revenue was still up about 4% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year quarter. 
 Now moving down the income statement. Total operating expenses for the second quarter were $235.5 million compared to $139 million in the second quarter of 2014, an increase of 69.4%. As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses increased to 58.2% of revenue compared to 50.8% in the second quarter of 2014. 
 Included in our operating expenses are merchant commissions, processing expenses, bad debt, selling and general administrative expense, depreciation and amortization expense and other operating net. Included in the second quarter of 2015 operating expense were additional operating expenses and significant additional amortization expense related to the acquisition of Comdata. 
 In addition, non-cash stock compensation included in general and administrative expense was $13.5 million in the second quarter of 2015 compared to only $7.7 million in the second quarter last year. 
 Credit losses were $4.9 million for the quarter or approximately 4 basis points compared to $6.7 million or 14 basis points in the second quarter of 2014. The 10-basis-point decrease in bad debt was due primarily to the inclusion of Comdata in the quarter, which had bad debt as a percentage of its billed revenue significantly below the FleetCor average and lower bad debt in our Russia business compared to last year. 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 100% to $48.8 million in the second quarter of 2015 from $24.4 million in the second quarter of 2014. The increase is primarily due to amortization of intangible assets related to the Comdata acquisition. 
 Interest expense increased 241% to $18.1 million in the second quarter of 2015 from $5.3 million in the second quarter of 2014. The increase in interest expense was due primarily to additional borrowings to finance the Comdata acquisition. 
 Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2015 was 32.1% compared to 30.8% for the second quarter of 2014. The increase in the effective tax rate was due primarily to the inclusion of the Comdata business, which operates primarily in the U.S. with a higher overall tax rate versus the average FleetCor rate. 
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $514 million in total cash. Approximately $129 million is restricted and are primarily customer deposits. 
 As of June 30, 2015, we had approximately $1,970,000,000 outstanding on our Term A loan, $249 million outstanding on our Term B loan and $381 million drawn in our revolver, leaving $654 million of undrawn availability. 
 We also had approximately $764 million borrowed against our securitization facility. 
 As of June 30, 2015, our leverage ratio was 2.69x EBITDA, down from 2.86x in the first quarter, which is well below our covenant level of 4.25x EBITDA. We intend to continue to use our free cash flow to temporarily pay down the balance on our revolving credit facility and securitization facility and maintain liquidity for acquisitions and other corporate purposes. 
 And finally, we are not a capital-intensive business and we spent only $8.1 million on CapEx during the second quarter of 2015. 
 Now onto our outlook for the remainder of 2015. We are raising our guidance to reflect our second quarter beat [ph] in adjusted net income per diluted share and the inclusion of the SVS business for the remainder of the year. However, we also continued to be cautious about the macroeconomic environment for the remainder of the year, including foreign exchange rates. 
 If they stay where they are today, we will have an incremental $0.05 to $0.06 headwind in adjusted net income per diluted share for the rest of the year. 
 As a result, for fiscal 2015, we are updating our financial guidance as follows: Total revenues between $1,690,000,000 and $1,730,000,000, up from the previous guidance range of between $1,600,000,000 and $1,650,000,000, adjusted net income between the $580 million and $590 million, up from the previous guidance range of between $565 million and $585 million; adjusted net income per diluted share between $6.17 and $6.27, up from the previous guidance range of between $6 and $6.20. 
 The company's fiscal year guidance assumptions for 2015 are as follows: Weighted average fuel price of $2.80 for the balance of the year in the U.S. compared to $3.62 per gallon average in the U.S. in the second half of 2014, down approximately 23%. 
 Market spreads lower in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 compared to the third and fourth quarters of 2014. And as a reminder, spread levels in the third and fourth quarters of 2014 were at record levels. 
 Foreign exchange rates equal to the 7-day average ending July 13, resulting in a negative impact to adjusted revenue of approximately $12 million and approximately $0.05 or $0.06 in adjusted net income per diluted share compared to previous guidance. 
 We are exploring other alternatives for the SVS business and we believe it will take to the end of the year before we reach a final conclusion. As a result, we are including the SVS business in our guidance for the remainder of the year. 
 We're assuming fully diluted shares outstanding of 94.3 million shares. And as always, no impact related to acquisitions or material new partnership agreements not already disclosed. 
 Our adjusted net income per diluted share guidance at the midpoint of the range represents an approximately 20% growth rate over the $5.15 in adjusted net income per diluted share reported in 2014. 
 And although we do not anticipate providing quarterly guidance on an ongoing basis, we believe it is prudent to do so given the impact of the several items just discussed that impact the rest of the year. 
 For the third quarter, we are expecting adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $1.58 and $1.64 in adjusted net income per diluted share. 
 And with that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from David Togut of Evercore ISI. 
David Togut: Could you quantify the growth in Comdata earnings that you expect for 2015 as a whole? 
Eric R. Dey: David, we really haven't disclosed that information anywhere. I think we have provided some relative range in the past. I think what we've said is we want to exit kind of 2015 in that kind of 20% trajectory. Our objective is to invest more money in sales and marketing and take that business from what was a kind of historical 6% organic grower and kind of get it into that 10% range. So we are in the process of investing more money in sales and marketing, and we tend to kind of build that sales engine throughout the year. And we hope to kind of exit in a much better place as we get into 2016. 
Ronald F. Clarke: David, it's Ron. I probably guided, call it mid-teens. We had planned kind of 10% and 20%. And although we don't have that number handy, we back off of a tad on the corporate payments things. So that would be our estimate, kind of mid-to high teens. 
David Togut: Got it. And then on the corporate payments, could you give a more granularity in terms of what you're seeing with the opt-outs on the health care side and virtual, and then also just a little more on the RFID rollout, which you called out in Q1 as well. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I think the good news is it stabilized. So kind of the surprise we got, that we mentioned in the last call in the first quarter, it's kind of not much new. So I'd say that the health care piece is basically stabilized. And I'd say we've got a 50% chance of getting that account back that I called out. So I'd say that's the update. 
David Togut: Got it. And then you called out 125 salespeople added year-to-date. Could you give us a sense of what businesses you added them and any perspective you have on the OTR business at Comdata, particularly given the 3% decline in WEX's same-store sales in OTR? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. So the -- I think I've mentioned it in the opening, David, but we went into kind of the emerging markets, at least emerging for us, which will be Brazil, Mexico and Australia, and we put some fair number into Comdata -- in the both businesses in Comdata. So those 4 areas got the majority of the 125. And that was a follow-up on OTR, was that the second part of the question? 
David Togut: That's right, given what we heard from WEX on their call. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, that revenue was up on a pro forma basis. It's funny. Yesterday, I was reviewing something and we're looking at that exiting in Q4 well above 10%. So in the forecast that we've given, I've got good news to report that, that forecast that we have, had that line of business over Q3 and Q4 growing double-digit, which was the goal we had. So I'd say we're on track to get that done this year. 
David Togut: That's very encouraging. You mentioned Uber, 75% adoption rate. Can you dimension for us what Uber might mean from a revenue and earnings perspective once you have a full year of that contract under your belt? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Not so much because of the confidentiality with them, but I would say that the client Uber and us were delighted. I mean, to go out to 100 people with an offer and get 75 to take it and get 40 to actually use it in the first 60 to 90 days, I think, speaks to the promotion that they've done and the interest in the thing. So it is way, way ahead, David, of what we thought it would be over the last 2 or 3 months. And we're standing by for their call to try to take it to additional places. So it's off to a great start. 
David Togut: That's great to hear. Just a quick final question. Where do you stand with some of these big oil companies in Europe with respect to outsourcing, particularly as oil prices continue to decline? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I'd say not much new to report. I think we -- it sounds like we could just tape record the prior session that I think of at least 2 or 3 of them are still kind of waiting to see how we do with Shell, and how WEX does with Exxon. But I think I mentioned in the last call that we are in conversations with a couple of big ones that are evaluating go in the same way. And my guess is they'll make some decision later this year or next as they get a chance to see more. So I think again, we still view it as kind of really big opportunity with a million dollar question being when, when will they pull the trigger? 
Operator: The next question comes from Phil Stiller of Citi. 
Philip Stiller: You guys introducing new products in Europe over the last couple of quarters in the U.K. and Germany. Maybe you could talk about how those products are being received thus far? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Phil, it's Ron. I'd say still early days on the universal card in Germany, which is we think a big, big opportunity. I'd say we're still in the kitchen testing, trying to get the product right, kind of get level 3 and that capability into the version 1.0. And second, we're trying to get the sales team and the message buffed up so that we can get some traction. The good news is the stuff is working. We've obviously got pilot clients running on the product and we've got people selling it. So I'd say that so far, so good. And on the U.K., I think the reception has been terrific, and we expect to convert a very sizable part of our base in the second half over this new AllStar 1 product. They really like it. They've been waiting quite a while because it was quite complicated, changing the platform to Visa from proprietary and chip-and-pin and adding a discount network to it and getting all that to work on one card on a system we put in 1.5 years ago, was a 10 in terms of difficulty, but we've got it all working and all rolling now and it's -- the thing we like is it's not only good for customers because they get more benefits, but it's good for us because we get improved economics. So that'll roll, as I said, in the second half. 
Philip Stiller: Okay. That sounds encouraging. Can you provide an update on Shell? So you're in 5 countries, and I think you have a few more rolling out. Like how would you grade your progress thus far? And I guess, how does that play into what David asked about in terms of further discussions with other companies? 
Ronald F. Clarke: That's a funny one because I grade all of our execution progress and staff meetings. And that one, if you said in the meeting is an A. So the couple of guys running that is our Europe guy and our CIO because it's pretty technical. And they not only have gotten to the conversion schedule a 5 to date and 2 more, 7 this year, but we've gotten to the revenue plan in terms of the timing. So I'd say of all the new things we do, that's been about as good as anything we've done. And I'd say that we communicated or I did, that, that project would deliver, I believe $20 million to $30 million of new incremental annualized revenue. And I'd say we're highly confident it'll exit this year into '16 inside of that range. So A, A to A minus on that project. 
Philip Stiller: Okay, good. Last question and I'll turn it over. Just M&A pipeline, obviously the balance sheet improved, given the cash flow you produced since Comdata. Any update on the pipeline? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I guess we could say that we got a number of deals that are active. A couple of those are getting to be pretty late innings. As you said, I think our comfort level, I don't remember -- recall Eric's number 2 7, I think, with the ratio, Phil. But we're projecting that thing to be under 2 5 as we exit the year and, b, we got capacity back for management absorbing the things. So I'd say that it feels good to be doing something now. And second, I want to call out earlier that the newest things we've done is Epyx and Pac Pride, we haven't lost our touch, right? They're up 26% and 30%. So when we buy stuff, we seem to do something with it. 
Operator: The next question comes from James Schneider of Goldman Sachs. 
James Schneider: Following up on the theme of the earlier questions. With respect to Shell and the proof points that you think other oil companies in Europe look to, what are some of the key metrics? Is it just productivity per account or is it growth in accounts? Or what are the metrics or dimensions that you think that the other oil companies are looking to in that proof? And I guess, maybe you can give us any kind of internal metrics you might be using to grade that beyond the letter grades? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, James. It's Ron, again. I think that's a good question. I'd say the 2 primary metrics would be around reliability and satisfaction. So the first one is, "Hey, I moved a big part of my portfolio over to you, Mr. Outsourcer. How are you doing with it?" Are they happy, the cards work and the call is being answered, the bill is accurate, all the mechanics of running a program reliably and in a satisfactory way. And then 2, I'd say volume in sales. They hired us to try to build these files, so are we selling or are we producing new business. Because a lot of the other pieces of their decision were already in the contract, like the economics and some of the other things. So they already know those as part of the contract. So I'd say those will be the 2 primary gates for other people to want to study. 
James Schneider: Yes, that's helpful. And then just as a follow-up. Specifically on Comdata, I know that growing the small fleet business within Comdata in OTR was kind of always a big priority for you. Can you maybe talk about where you are in terms of those initiatives, what you've done to grow that business and where do you think you might be as we go into 2016 in terms of driving some kind of absolute amount of revenue from that? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, again, I think -- I've said that last time and I'd say it again. I think the best surprise -- the happiest surprise for us in the Comdata deal is the -- what we call the North America Trucking business, that the -- not only its progress, as I outlooked, it will be double-digit Q3, Q4 off a pro forma. But I think, as I said before, the set of ideas that we have now to grow that thing are longer. We weren't quite as smart in diligence. And so I'll give 1 example beyond the salespeople. So we studied our CLC business a quarter or so ago and saw a large concentration of trucking companies in there. So went to the Comdata trucking clients and found a massive demand if we could put the hotel purchasing capability onto the Comdata fuel purchasing card, kind of make that into 1 card. So that be an example of something that is, we think, super interesting to that client base that was not in our plans, that we expect to have out in the second half. So there's 2 or 3 of those kinds of things that are kind of big new ideas that leverage this leading position Comdata has, that we like a lot. 
Operator: The next question comes from Darrin Peller of Barclays. 
Darrin Peller: Look, I know it might be a little bit of a repeat, but if you could help explain some of the drivers underneath the 8% organic growth. I know you went through some of the revenue per transaction items, but some of it was without Comdata or SVS. And I guess, just building -- the building blocks up to that 8% just given all the moving parts again and the revenue growth rates, I think that's just be helpful really, what's driving that? And then just the bigger picture question after. 
Eric R. Dey: Yes. Darrin, this is Eric. I think we try to answer those on the call and I think they're similar to the last quarter, last several quarters. And that is, in the United States, as an example, we've been very successful growing our MasterCard business and we continue to grow that very successfully and it was up another 30% in the quarter. Similarly, CLC continues to do very well and that was up kind of 13%. Even the Comdata business, if you look at it, first, call it excluding the SVS business was up about 6% or 7% organically, and probably about 6% or 5% or 6% organically with the SVS business because that was relatively flat in the quarter. So overall, the U.S. businesses grew. Again, excluding Comdata for a second, grew organically in the 11% range. But again, driven primarily by the same couple of businesses that they have in the past. And then internationally, the organic growth was around 9% and again, driven by specifically a couple of things that we called out. Shell Europe is doing very well, we're into 5 different countries. We closed on this Epyx deal a while ago. We're seeing a lot of success and in doing some of the things we do around those new businesses, and that business was up call it around 30%, again, helping to drive some of that. Our Mexico business was up double-digit as an example. And even Russia, as bad as that economy is doing, you even look at that on a constant currency basis, that business was even up still kind of around 4%. So a lot of things kind of just -- we're kind of chugging along and doing okay, but I think the things that have always performed well continue to perform well. 
Darrin Peller: That's helpful. I think it's just the -- you hear about transaction growth rates, like international being down 4% and you kind of wonder a little bit if seems like it's really a compilation of just all the other -- all these other drivers. 
Eric R. Dey: Yes. I mean, the transaction growth were down internationally, I mean, because there's a couple economies that are soft. You look at Russia as an example. And we've got a product in Russia that has a lot of transactions but lower revenue per tran. So our transaction volumes are actually down in that particular business, but they're actually up in the business that we're investing more sales and marketing dollars in and it's a much higher revenue per tran business. So it's a trade-off kind of bad calories for good calories there. And similarly, in Brazil, although you know what's going on there, the economy is very soft and our transaction volumes have been impacted kind of there as well, but we've also been doing a lot of the things we do to help improve those businesses. And we're seeing improvements in kind of revenue per tran in the businesses that we have although transaction volumes have been down. 
Darrin Peller: That's helpful. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Darrin, it's Ron. Let me just give you maybe just a different, maybe simpler cut. Hey, we've got these 20 businesses and we tell you we're growing 10% on a constant environment pre-Comdata. Another way to think about it is, from a portfolio perspective, 1/3 of our businesses are growing super, 15%, 20% plus and we call them out, MasterCard, CLC, virtual card, Comdata, Epyx, the new deal, Mexico, oil partners that we didn't have before. So we tend to call out things to try to help you guys see, "Oh, my God", so 1/3 or more of this company is growing big and they're calling it out. A lot of us say there's another 1/3 that's kind of growing low to mid-single-digits. Telematics, Brazil because of the economy, whatever. And I think the other big turnaround which we didn't call out is, we had some stuff that was going the wrong way, right? Czech, Russia, some other portfolios that now basically have gotten back to neutral. So it's a lot easier to grow a business when you don't have 2 or 3 businesses basically going the other way. But I mean, the way we think about it in the company is it's a portfolio of businesses and the goal is to kind of get all of them, we've called out the Comdata thing up to this minimum 10% and we've got some set of high fliers that we called out, some that aren't quite there yet and others that have lot longer way to go and that's the work that we're on. 
Darrin Peller: All right. That's really helpful, Ron. Look, I mean, just one follow-up for you, Ron, I guess. With regard to the sort of added additional pillars that might help the story out in acquisition terms or even organic, but I think more acquisition terms, you mentioned you're kind of late stage on some. I mean, obviously you also have some different things shifting around with SVS now. So I'm just curious, I mean, what are the types of things you're looking at right now in terms of both whether it's industries or it's size? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, again, I think the primary thing, Darrin, that we want to communicate as always is we're looking at stuff we know. So the main thing, I think, for any investors that read this or hear this is, we're not going way far afield and trying to buy stuff that we don't understand or more importantly, that we can't make better. So I'd say everything that's working into the later stages that we're looking at is something that we know and can make work. With that, I'd say we're always chasing obviously geography, trying to get positioned in places that are big or attractive. And then second obviously is to get positions with products that are in this high performance, right kind of category. And so I'd say that we were fortunate enough in our pipeline to have a few deals that fit that screen. And so the question is can we get them out the other side now? But I'd say we're in a good place and I think as I said earlier is that the leverage ratio and the capacity are in a much better place now for us to pull the trigger. 
Darrin Peller: Yes. So that $750 million capital outlay per year average, I think you had discussed that maybe in the last couple of comment around potential deals, that's still about right, the right way to think about it? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I think it will be bumping. We could come and announce something bigger than that or some series of smaller things. I think again, the structural model thing that we're trying to do is design a company that can grow 10 and 15 organically and that we can add more than 5% on the bottom. And so our math says if we simply invest the free cash flow, which is circa what, Eric? 600, 700, 800 year, over the 3 years, Darrin, that makes the math work and can we can keep deliver in the 20% plus, so that's the basis for the target. 
Operator: The last question comes from Smitti of Morgan Stanley. 
Smittipon Srethapramote: So it looks like your processing costs came down quite a bit sequentially. Can you talk about the factors that led to the decline in that line item? 
Eric R. Dey: Smitti, this is Eric. A lot of that had to do with the inclusion of the Comdata business. I don't have the specific items in front of me that were in there. But bad debt as an example of actually in processing if you're looking at the specific line in the P&L and bad debt for Comdata run substantially lower than it does for the FleetCor average. So if you recall, we averaged, what, 4 basis points this quarter and historically, we're probably in the 12, 13, 14 basis point range, so things like that are actually more favorable. But again, the Comdata business as a whole and the makeup of that business is just a little bit different than the legacy FleetCor business was. So that's all that's driving that. There wasn't anything unusual going on there. 
Smittipon Srethapramote: And just to follow up on just the growth rate within a particular division, in CLC. I think you called out, you guys called out that CLC grew at 13% last quarter, which is -- seems to be a deceleration from the growth rates that we've heard about in the past. Can you just talk about the potential for growth in that business over a longer term and is there a potential to accelerate the growth rate in the coming quarters? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, it's me. It's Ron, again. I'd say the explanation there is similar to last quarter. So there's nothing different than that, business has gotten bigger, obviously quite a bit bigger because it's been growing 20% plus. And I think I mentioned in the last call that as part of the '15 plan, we put another 50% sales investment in that business to get better aligned with the base, the size of the business. And basically, we were a little late doing that. And so that group of sales -- new sales producers haven't started to produce enough yet to grow that base to 20%. But I'd say that stay tuned for their progress in the second half and then stay tuned for things, like, again taking that product and bringing it to a new market like Comdata's trucking market. So we continue to love that business and are just finding the right way to invest more in it. 
Operator: The next question comes from Meghna Ladha of Susquehanna Financial. 
Meghna Ladha: Quick question, Eric, on guidance. What's the revenue contribution from SVS in the second half? And can you quantify the benefit from higher fuel price assumption? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes. To answer your first question, we're not going to provide that specific of guidance regarding SVS. As you know, we're trying to do some things with that business, so getting very specific with some of that information is not helpful to us in this process. So we're going to -- we're not going to disclose that. Regarding the -- what was the second part of your question again, I'm sorry? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Fuel price. 
Eric R. Dey: Fuel price. Yes, our assumption was that fuel prices are going to average kind of $2.80 over the balance of the year. And our assumption is kind of consistent with the way we always kind of think about and then provide guidance historically, meaning we don't try to speculate where fuel prices are going. So effectively, we put a stake in the ground and wherever that price is at the time we do our forecast, we assume that, that price is going to stay where it is over the balance of the year. That $2.80 price is up very slightly from the assumption that we had in Q1. So we're not looking for any sort of meaningful additional contribution related to higher fuel prices or that change in assumption, I would say. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, it's Ron. Let me just add to that again, I don't know if you guys track this, but we did get a little help in Q2, as I mentioned, from fuel price being up a bit, but it's backtracked again. So if you look at kind of the first quarter, which we -- the first month of Q3, it's receded again another $0.10 or $0.15 back. So it's kind of back more where we expected it to be in the second quarter, which is why we've kind of stay put with the guidance. 
Meghna Ladha: Got it. So the $0.12 guidance that you raised for the EPS, it reflects Q2 beat [ph] SVS ex-FX, correct? 
Ronald F. Clarke: You got it. That's the math. 
Meghna Ladha: Okay. And then how should we think about the margins in the second half now that you will be retaining the SVS business through the year -- through the rest of the year? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes. I would just assume that the margins we have in the second quarter kind of continued through the balance of the year, I mean, they're not going to be dramatically off of that, up or down. 
Ronald F. Clarke: But they will be a little bit better in the second half because of the revenue growth on that. 
Meghna Ladha: Okay. Just a quick question, a clarification rather. So one of the -- the WEX, they saw weakness in domestic same-store sales in the OTR space, I may have heard this either correct or wrong, please correct me if I'm wrong, but do you still expect 10% organic growth in the OTR space and you are not seeing any weakness in same-store sales here? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, the answer is in the Comdata Trucking business, we had kind of neutral same-store volumes, which means the trucking companies were able to add enough additional drivers to compensate for some of the fuel efficiencies. So that was basically a push. But the incremental growth is coming from more sales in the second half, more price and then again, some of these new products. So it's not coming from same-store sales, but again, we're not getting hurt from that. 
Meghna Ladha: Got it. And did you quantify the contribution from Comdata in this quarter? 
Eric R. Dey: From a revenue -- we did not. But from a revenue perspective, it contributed approximately $139 million in revenue in the quarter. 
Operator: This concludes the time allocated for questions on today's call. This also concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines. Thank you for participating, and have a pleasant day.

===== 2015 Q1  (2015-04-30 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the FleetCor Technologies Inc. First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Eric Dey, CFO. Thank you. Please begin. 
Eric R. Dey: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. By now, everyone should have access to our first quarter press release. It can be found at www.fleetcor.com under the Investor Relations section.
 Throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than other companies' similarly titled non-GAAP information.
 Quantitative reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today's press release and on our website as previously described. Also, we are providing 2015 guidance on a non-GAAP basis.
 Finally, before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements. This includes forward-looking statements about our 2015 guidance, new products and fee initiatives, and expectations regarding business development and acquisitions. They are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore you should not put undue reliance on them.
 These results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Others are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. These documents are available on our website as previously discussed and at www.sec.gov.
 With our standard disclosures out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay, Eric, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call today. Upfront here, I'll plan to cover 3 subjects: first, I'll comment on Q1; second, I'll provide a general update on Comdata, our Shell Europe outsourcing program, along with some of our new product introductions; and then lastly, I'll discuss our 2015 guidance.
 Okay, so onto Q1. We reported earlier on Q1 revenue of $416 million, up 64% and cash EPS of $1.45, up 29%. So 64% top line, 29% bottom line.
 We built our plan for the quarter on a number of assumptions: fuel price; fuel spread; FX assumptions. And fortunately, we call the environment right, and although FX was a bit worse than planned, fuel prices were a bit better than planned and spreads were basically on plan. So in aggregate, the environment's impact at least versus our plan was effectively neutral for the quarter.
 When you look at the macroenvironment's impact versus the prior year, it's quite a different story and it's very negative. So fuel prices in the U.S. were down about $1 per gallon versus last year. FX was obviously very weak. We did get a little bit of an offset from positive fuel spreads. But that collection of factors created a cash EPS headwind of about $0.16 in the quarter. So if you thought about our business in a constant environment, like-for-like environment to last year, we'd be reporting a fleet cash EPS of $1.61 or $0.16 higher, which would produce a 44% profit growth, so pretty big environmental impact.
 Okay, let me transition to the drivers for the quarter. There were basically 3. So first, our biggest businesses performed well. Our North America fuel car business was up 17% in the quarter, obviously helped by wide spreads. Our U.K. businesses grew 10% in local currency and CLC grew 17% in the quarter, so big businesses doing well. Second, some of our newer businesses -- newer clients came fully online. Our Canadian private label clients, Ultramar and Husky, are basically fully online. And our Shell Germany and Shell Austria, new contract is basically fully live. So we got help from both of those. And then third, we had a full quarter of Comdata, which made a massive contribution to our Q1 results. And inside of that overall performance, Comdata's corporate payments line of business grew 32%, 32% year-over-year, so terrific start there. Our Q1 fundamentals were quite strong. Our organic revenue growth was approximately 9% in the quarter on a constant fuel price, constant currency and constant spread basis, so solid. So look, given the environment that we're operating in, we are delighted to report 29% EPS profit growth for the quarter.
 Let me now transition over to just a few general updates, starting out with our Comdata. So Comdata had basically an on-plan first quarter per our expectations. We've completed most of our cost and price synergy work, and we're now well underway in our growth planning work. We're also well underway stepping up our sales hiring in both of those businesses adding sales people. We do want to point out that we expect some rest of the year headwind at Comdata, first is our internal plan, one area is higher than planned opt-out rates in our healthcare business, so in our virtual card business; and second, we're experiencing slower adoption of Comdata's RFID point-of-sale solutions for truck stops, and that will likely impact our second half plan. So a couple of areas in Comdata that we expect to run behind plan going forward.
 As regards SVS, the gift card company, we're finally reaching the end of our sale process. The audit work for 2013 and 2014 took a bit longer than planned, but that is now behind us. So we're now evaluating final bids for SVS and expect to have a resolution by the end of Q2. The Shell Europe outsourcing contract, we've made really good progress there. As I mentioned, Germany, the biggest market, is now fully operational. The revenue is tracking to plan and the same can be said for the second Shell market, Austria. We're planning to convert 3 new Shell markets literally next week: France, Belgium and the Netherlands. And again, that's consistent with our internal timing. So off to a very good start and getting into new markets in Continental Europe could be in 5 new markets by the end of May.
 Lastly, we want to report that we're going live with some exciting new products at FleetCor, products that are central to our long-term growth prospects. We can report that we are officially live with our new universal MasterCard product in Germany. So we've got a small dedicated sales team testing demand for that product right now. Second, we've gone live with our new electronic toll product in Brazil, and we're beginning to cross-sell this new capability to our CTF trucking clients. And lastly, we're expecting to go live with our Pac Pride extended network card program, here in the U.S. This product gives us the opportunity to literally double our Pac Pride business over time. So quite exciting to be going live with a number of new products.
 Okay, lastly, let me transition over now to our full year guidance. We are maintaining our rest of the year guidance at $4.65 in cash EPS at the midpoint, but we are raising today our full year guidance $0.05 to 6 10 to reflect our Q1 beat. We're obviously remaining cautious on the rest of the year, holding that intact, and we're doing that for a few reasons: one, as I mentioned, we're expecting some downward pressure against our Comdata plan from the higher healthcare opt-outs and the slower adoption of the RFID solution; two, Russia and particularly the Russia partner business, our small independent retail clients are -- they're really hurting from the Russia slowdown; and then third, we're looking at April's unfavorable FX rates, and I mean by that unfavorable versus our 2015 full year plan. So when we estimate that April's rates would create about an $0.08 incremental headwind for us to the rest of the year.
 Fortunately, we've got some offsets that have us keeping our rest-of-year guidance intact. We expect the rest of our businesses to perform at our plan or even a bit better based on their start. And as I mentioned, we expect to hold on to SVS, at least for Q2, which was unplanned. So these few puts and takes, we're maintaining our rest-of-year guidance as is, but again raising full year cash EPS estimates to 6 10 at the midpoint.
 So with that, let me turn the call back over to Eric. He'll provide some additional detail on the quarter and on our outlook. Eric? 
Eric R. Dey: Thank you, Ron. For the first quarter of 2015, we reported revenue of $416.2 million, an increase of 64% from the first quarter of 2014. The revenue from our North American segment increased 136% to $298.8 million from $126.4 million in the first quarter of 2014. Included in the first quarter results was the impact of Comdata, which was acquired on November 14, 2014. Revenue from our International segment decreased $10.2 million or 8% to $117.4 million from $127.5 million in the first quarter of 2014. For the first quarter of 2015, GAAP net income increased 25% to $94.2 million or $1 per diluted share from $75.1 million or $0.88 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2014.
 The other financial metrics that we routinely use are adjusted revenues and adjusted net income, which we sometimes also refer to as cash net income or cash EPS. Adjusted revenues equal our GAAP revenues less merchant commissions. We use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate the company's revenues, net of the commissions that are paid to merchants who participate in certain car programs.
 A reconciliation of adjusted revenues and adjusted net income to GAAP numbers are provided in Exhibit 1 of our press release. Adjusted revenues in the first quarter of 2015 increased 65% to $388.8 million compared to $236.3 million in the first quarter of 2014. Adjusted net income for the first quarter of 2015 increased 41% to $135.9 million or $1.45 per diluted share compared to $96.1 million or $1.12 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2014.
 Elements of the macroeconomic environment had a significant impact on our results in the first quarter, specifically market fuel spread margins, fuel prices and foreign exchange rates. In the aggregate, we estimate that these macroeconomic items negatively impacted our business in the first quarter of 2015 versus the first quarter of 2014 by approximately $30 million in adjusted revenue or $0.16 in adjusted net income per diluted share. Changes in foreign exchange rates were unfavorable in all geographies for the quarter. And overall, we believe negatively impacted adjusted revenue during the quarter by approximately $19 million. Fuel prices decreased during the quarter, and although we cannot precisely calculate the impact of these changes, we believe they negatively impacted adjusted revenues by approximately $26 million.
 Partially offsetting these negative impacts were fuel spread margins, which continue to be very favorable versus prior year levels and resulted in a favorable impact to adjusted revenues in the first quarter. And although we cannot precisely calculate the impact of these changes, we believe it positively impacted our adjusted revenues by approximately $16 million in the first quarter.
 To better understand the organic growth for the quarter, we calculated revenues using constant currency, fuel price and market spread margins. Based on these criteria, we would have reported approximately an 11% organic growth rate for the quarter, excluding the Comdata business and 9% on a consolidated basis.
 For the first quarter of 2015, transaction volumes increased 392% to 431.3 million transactions compared to 87.6 million transactions in the first quarter of 2014.
 North American segment transactions grew 851%, driven primarily by the acquisition of Comdata on November 14, and also from organic growth in our U.S. businesses. Transaction volumes in our International segment were approximately flat at 46.8 million transactions.
 For discussion on revenue per transaction, we're going to exclude the impact of the SVS business, which had approximately 301 million transactions in the quarter at a very low revenue per transaction.
 Revenue per transaction for the first quarter of 2015, excluding the SVS business, decreased 1% to $2.87 from $2.90 in the first quarter of 2014.
 Revenue per transaction can vary based on the geography, the relevant merchant and customer relationship, the payment product utilized and the types of products or services purchased.
 The revenue mix was influenced by our acquisitions, organic growth in the business and fluctuations in the macroeconomic environment as previously discussed. Revenue per transaction decreased 1.8% in North America due primarily to lower fuel prices during the quarter versus the prior year quarter, partially offset by higher spread margins and the mixed impact of the Comdata acquisition, excluding SVS, which has revenue per transaction products lower than the historical FleetCor average.
 In the international segment, revenue per transaction decreased 7.2%, due primarily to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates across all of our geographies and lower fuel prices. This unfavorable impact was partially offset by organic revenue growth in several lines of business.
 Now let's shift over and discuss some of the other drivers of our first quarter performance. For our North American segment, most of our lines of business performed well. On a constant currency, fuel spread and fuel price basis, we reported approximately 14% organic growth rate in the quarter, excluding the impact of the Comdata acquisition.
 Some of the positive drivers in North America revenue during the quarter were similar to the last several quarters, including the exceptional performance of our MasterCard product, which had revenue growth of approximately 40% over the first quarter of 2014 measured in constant fuel price. The increase in revenue was driven primarily by increases in both transactions and revenue per transaction on a constant fuel price basis.
 The CLC Group, provider of our lodging card programs, had another solid quarter, with 17% revenue growth over the first quarter of 2014. This revenue growth was driven primarily by increases in our CheckINN Direct product, which targets smaller accounts. As I mentioned earlier, the macroeconomic environment was mixed. Very favorable fuel spread margins in the quarter versus the first quarter of 2014 positively impacted our adjusted revenue for the quarter by approximately $16 million, which was more than offset by the impact of lower fuel prices during the quarter of approximately $26 million in adjusted revenue.
 And finally, the first quarter also benefited from our acquisition of Comdata.
 Organic growth in the International segment was approximately 9% for the first quarter measured in constant currency and fuel price. However, as I mentioned earlier, unfavorable foreign exchange rates in all geographies negatively impacted adjusted revenues by approximately $19 million in the quarter. Results in our International business were impacted by: strong organic growth in our U.K. business, which posted double-digit revenue growth over last year in local currency; the rollout of Shell Germany and Austria; strong organic growth in our Mexico business, which also posted double-digit revenue growth over the prior year in constant currency; and Russia volumes remain soft; and foreign exchange rates continue to be unfavorable. However, on a constant currency basis, our Russia business is approximately flat compared to the prior year quarter.
 Now moving down the income statement. Total operating expenses for the first quarter were $252.4 million compared to $139.8 million in the first quarter of 2014, an increase of 80.6%.
 As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses increased to 60.6% of revenue compared to 55% in the first quarter of 2014. Included in operating expenses are merchant commissions, processing expenses, bad debt, selling and general administrative expense, depreciation and amortization expense and other operating net, including in the first quarter of 2015 operating expense where normal operating expenses related to the Comdata for the quarter and significant additional amortization expense related to the acquisition of Comdata.
 Credit losses were $8.1 million for the quarter or approximately 13 basis points compared to $5.6 million or 12 basis points in the first quarter of 2014. The slight increase in bad debt was primarily due to the inclusion of Comdata operations in the quarter.
 Depreciation and amortization increased 96.9% to $48.1 million in the first quarter of 2015 from $24.4 million in the first quarter of 2014. The increase was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets related to the Comdata acquisition.
 Interest expense increased 258% to $19.6 million in the first quarter of 2015 from $5.5 million in the first quarter of 2014. The increase in interest expense was due primarily to additional borrowings to finance the Comdata acquisition.
 Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2015 was 32.6% compared to 30.5% for the first quarter of 2014. The increase in the effective tax rate was due primarily to the inclusion of the Comdata business, which operates primarily in the U.S., with a higher overall tax rate versus the average FleetCor rate.
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $509 million in total cash, approximately $129.6 million of which is restricted and are primarily customer deposits.
 As of March 31, 2015, we had approximately $1,995,000,000 outstanding on our Term A loan, $249 million outstanding on our Term B loan and $556 million drawn on our revolver, leaving $479 million of undrawn availability. We also had approximately $679 million borrowed against our securitization facility.
 As of March 31, 2015, our leverage ratio was 2.86x EBITDA, which is well below our covenant level of 4.25x EBITDA. We intend to continue to use our free cash flow to temporarily pay down the balance on our revolving credit facility and securitization facility and maintain liquidity for acquisitions and other corporate purposes.
 Finally, we are not a capital-intensive business, and we spent only $8.1 million on CapEx during the first quarter of 2015.
 Now onto our outlook for the remainder of 2015. We are raising our guidance to reflect our strong first quarter results, but continue to be cautious about the remainder of the year for a few reasons. We are expecting downward pressure in our Comdata business from higher healthcare opt-out rates and slower POS sales in our merchant business than expected. Also, we are expecting our Russia partner business to be soft as our small independent retail clients are really hurting from the Russian economic slowdown. And we are also assuming the April's unfavorable foreign exchange rates versus our internal plan assumptions will create an incremental $0.08 headwind the rest of the year. Fortunately, we have a couple of offsets to keep our rest-of-year guidance intact. We expect the rest of our businesses to perform at plan or a little better based on their start, and we expect to keep SVS for another quarter, which was unplanned.
 As a result, for fiscal 2015, we are updating our financial guidance for 2015 to be as follows: total revenues between $1,600,000,000 and $1,650,000,000, no change from the prior guidance; adjusted net income between $565 million and $585 million, up from the previous guidance range of between $560 million and $580 million; adjusted net income per diluted share between $6 and $6.20, up from the previous guidance range of between $5.95 and $6.15. The company's fiscal year guidance assumptions for 2015 are as follows: weighted fuel price up slightly to $2.59 average for the balance of the year in the U.S. compared to $2.58 in the prior guidance, and compared to $3.56 per gallon average in the U.S. in 2014, down approximately 30%.
 Market spread assumptions remain approximately the same as the prior guidance. Foreign exchange rates equal to the average of April 1 to 13, resulting in a negative impact to adjusted revenue of approximately $20 million and a negative impact to adjusted net income of approximately $0.08 in adjusted net income per diluted share compared to previous guidance.
 SVS business is retained for the entire second quarter of 2015. Although we now anticipate owning the SVS business for the second quarter, the SVS business does have some seasonality, and second quarter is traditionally the lowest quarter in terms of revenue and profit.
 Full year tax rate of 31.8% versus 32.1% in the previous guidance. Fully diluted shares outstanding of 94.3 million shares. And as always, no impact related to acquisitions or material new partnership agreements not already disclosed.
 Our adjusted net income per diluted share guidance at the midpoint of the range represents an approximately 18% growth rate over the $5.15 in adjusted income per diluted share reported in 2014. We expect that in the aggregate, foreign exchange rates, market spread margins and fuel prices create an approximate headwind of $160 million to $170 million in revenues or approximately $1 in adjusted net income per diluted share headwind compared to 2014 averages.
 On a constant currency, fuel price and market spread basis, our 2015 guidance would be approximately $7 in adjusted net income per diluted share for a growth rate of approximately 36% over the $5.15 adjusted net income per diluted share reported in 2014.
 We don't know how the environment will actually play out in 2015, but if it improves, either later this year or next, some of this headwind may actually come back as a tailwind.
 Although we do not anticipate providing quarterly guidance on an ongoing basis, we believe it is prudent to do so, given the impact of several items just discussed. For the second quarter, we are expecting adjusted net income per diluted share to be approximately the same as the first quarter. We are expecting our second quarter adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $1.44 and $1.46. Some of the items that are impacting the second quarter compared to the first quarter include the following: owning the SVS business for the entire second quarter. However, as I mentioned earlier, SVS has some seasonality, and we expect SVS to contribute approximately $0.04 less in adjusted net income per diluted share in the second quarter versus the first quarter. We are expecting FX rates to be unfavorable in the second quarter versus the first quarter and have an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.02 in adjusted net income per diluted share versus the first quarter, and spread should be at more normal levels and have less of an impact on revenue in the second quarter versus the first quarter.
 And finally, our volume is built throughout the year and our new asset initiatives gained momentum throughout the year, resulting in a much higher earnings per share in the third and fourth quarters.
 We have no plans to provide quarterly guidance going forward, but rather to update our annual guidance each quarter.
 And with that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore. 
David Togut: Ron, you mentioned a couple of factors at Comdata that were a little below plan, the -- I guess, higher-than-expected health care opt-out and slower-than-expected POS rollout. As you take a step back and look at Comdata relative to your initial plan from an earnings accretion perspective, how do you stand today versus at the time, I guess the last earnings conference call, let's say from a 1- and a 2-year accretion perspective? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Dave, I'd say we're probably in about the same place. We built an internal plan that had Comdata earnings in the high 20s. And our best guess now is that thing is still going to land about 20% for the year. So we had said, when we did the transaction that we wanted to grow EBITDA in that business 20% plus through the midterm and I think year 1 will be that. 
David Togut: Got it. And then I was pleased to hear that you're rolling out direct MasterCard. I thought you're actually going with Visa in Europe. Was that -- was there a last-minute change there? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, if you remember there's 2 different things. We actually are going with an extended card in the U.K. with Visa. And on the continent, we're actually going with MasterCard. So there are 2 different programs with 2 different networks. But it is finally live in Europe. We've been in the kitchen a long time with that product, so to have a quote in the market and start testing, it's great news. 
David Togut: How do you assess the revenue potential of the direct MasterCard on the European continent versus what you've seen in the U.S? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Again, on paper, David, it's a giant number, right? Again, the majority of Europe fuel card penetration, again, is on private label, oil company cards. There are not many independent universal products in any of the countries, and so the potential is enormous. The question is what's going to be the share. Our customers are on private label programs. In Germany, you're going to want a universal card. And so the answer in the U.S., as we told you is yes, almost all new accounts opt for the universal cards, but it's too early to call for Europe. 
David Togut: Understood. And then on CLC, you called out 17% revenue growth there. That had been running in the 20s, I believe, low to mid-20s. Any significant change there that would drive that? 
Ronald F. Clarke: No, just -- like always, the base is getting a little bit bigger. And we pumped some additional sales people into that business kind of a little later than we thought. So we're hoping, we'll kind of get back to that 20% as we work our way through the year. So it's really just the absolute size of the business getting bigger. 
David Togut: Got it. And then just a quick final question for me, on its earnings call, WEX called out some market share gains in Q1 in the OTR market. What are you seeing in the OTR market at Comdata? Are you preserving your share? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, again, the property that WEX bought was called Fleet One, which targets fundamentally smaller, David, smaller fleets, think 10, 20, 30 vehicle fleets. And the majority of Comdata's business is, it's very large. I think they have 18 or 19 of the top 25 fleets. So the answer is, we're kind of in different segments, and then b, I'd say it's stable. We've had very little attrition last year and, in fact, over the last few years, very little attrition on that business. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Jefferies. 
Ramsey El-Assal: I had a bit of a follow-up on one of David's questions. What does it mean exactly opt-out in the virtual card in Comdata's virtual card business? What's the context in which customers are opting out? 
Ronald F. Clarke: So the way to think about it, Ramsey, is the providers of health care, so think hospitals, docs, dentists, right, that actually receive the payments ultimately. So let's say, Comdata signs up with TPA who is paying Ramsey's doctor's office, he pays all 300 docs that he has, and then you basically call him and say, "Hey, I don't want to get paid with a virtual card." So an individual provider will basically tell his TPA, "Hey, I don't want to get paid that way. I don't want to get paid by check. I wanted get paid by ACH or wire," or whatever the guy says. And so basically, we plan and our business plans some opt-out rate, right, because, obviously, some people that go on this don't want to be on it and it's running higher than that plan that we build. 
Ramsey El-Assal: That makes sense. That helps. And can you break out the revenue and earnings contribution from SVS in Q1 and Q2? Just trying to get a better idea of sort of how it fits in. I know it's not a huge contributor to the bottom line. 
Eric R. Dey: Yes. Ramsey, this is Eric. And in Q1, just to give you some round numbers, I don't have the exact numbers in front of me, SVS contributed approximately $40 million, $42 million in revenue and $0.08 to $0.09 in cash EPS. And in Q2, again, there is a lot of seasonality to the business. And Q2 is traditionally the lowest quarter in terms of both revenue and profit by a pretty wide margin. So Q2 was more in the $30 million revenue range and around kind of, call it, $0.05 in cash EPS. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Because, obviously, Ramsey, the cost structure is pretty fixed in that business, so when revenue flexes down, obviously profits flex faster. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. And on that business, you mentioned that you're evaluating final bids. Does that mean that the divestiture here is kind of imminent? Or is there still a chance you might hold on to the asset? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I'd say we're -- you got to always see, obviously, the final documents and understand where we are. So we're getting to the end. We're obviously in final documentation with the party. So I'd say we're still going to make a decision, but we'll be making a call in the next 30 to 60 days. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. And then just last one from me. Are there any partnership or decent-size partnership or contract renewals that are coming up? Or are we in a good part of the cycle right now with that? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I'd say, in terms of new business, there's a couple of things that we're working on. I think we've said it historically, it's a long boil. So it's hard to say when, but we are in conversations with a couple of big people about helping them with their business. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. But no existing large contracts that are coming up for renewal? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Correct, nothing imminent. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Smittipon Srethapramote with Morgan Stanley. 
Danyal Hussain: This is Danyal Hussain calling for Smitty. Just another follow-up on the virtual card opt-outs. Is this at all related to the change in control? Or is this just your typical attrition? And just in light of that, it seems like you're still seeing very robust growth rate. You had 32% corporate payments growth. So is that you're seeing growth above and beyond what you have expected elsewhere like in construction, or is that mostly in line? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, the short answer is the second thing you said, right, it's not related to our involvement. And yes, you're right. Although we're calling out the opt-out rates running higher, what you said is right. The business still delivered 30% plus, and the full year forecast is in that kind of a range. So I don't want to give the view that it's not a terrific business because it's one of the core reasons we bought it. It's just not quite as super terrific as we thought. So it's just going to inch back a bit from our plan. 
Danyal Hussain: Got it. And then just following up on the direct MasterCard product. I know there were some differences, I think, in functionality, just given level 3 data isn't prevalent in Europe. So can you just talk about how that functionality compares to maybe what you have in the U.S? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, there are -- I think the major difference again is the taxes, the VAT treatment in Europe. So we -- we've launched kind of version 1.0 that has, call it, 80% of the capability, and we hope to be out with kind of version 2.0, call it, another quarter that gets -- it gets us almost all the way there. So we are working to kind of equal the U.S. functionality. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. 
Ashish Sabadra: Quickly on MasterCard. If I heard that number right, it was the growth 40%. That seems like an acceleration from the mid-20s that you've seen in the past few quarters. So I was just wondering if you could provide more color on that front? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes. Ashish, this is Eric. Yes. I mean, when we called out that 40% or when I called it out, that is normalized, assuming the same fuel price in 2015 as we had in 2014. So it's on an apples-to-apples basis. That product has been growing kind of in the mid-20s. I guess, if you go back and you look at the last several quarters, our growth rate has accelerated a little bit in the quarter. Again, it does bounce around kind of from quarter-to-quarter. So we saw growth in both transaction volumes and gallons during the quarter, and we also saw growth in revenue per transaction as well, which is kind of contributing to that increase. But it does bounce around a little bit from quarter-to-quarter. 
Ashish Sabadra: That's great. Just quickly on the international front. It looks like the organic growth was pretty good there, 9%, but the transactions actually declined in the quarters year-on-year. So I was wondering if you can just provide some color on the transaction growth in international? And when do we see that trough and improving going forward? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes. I mean, if you go back and you look at the international business, I think Ron actually made some comments around this. I mean, certainly, there are some businesses that have softened a little bit. You look at our Russia business as an example, which is kind of flat to kind of down from prior year. We've also seen economies soften in places like Brazil, which have impacted transaction volumes. But we have other places where transaction volumes are actually performing well. I mean, the U.K. as an example, the rollout of euro shell into the couple of markets that we're already into. And when you add it all up, it kind of adds to around flat transaction growth. But again, I think it's more than anything else. It's just softened economy in a couple of places that's kind of driving the number. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Phil Stiller with Citi. 
Philip Stiller: Ron, I think on the last earnings call you talked about accelerating some price recovery initiatives in the first quarter. Maybe you could talk about how that went, what the customer response was, and if there's any additional work to be done for the rest of the year? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I'd say, Phil, it's worked out pretty well, not perfectly, but I'd say, call it, 90% of what we had planned. I think the reaction has been good. We spent a fair amount of time testing our way kind of in the first quarter. So I'd say there's not much left for us to understand. Now we'll start to pick up some of the benefits of that kind of in Q2, 3 and 4. So, so far so good. 
Philip Stiller: Great. In terms of Comdata, so obviously there's a couple of headwinds to deal with that you still said the earnings growth should be north of 20%. I'm just trying to understand, I guess, how much of that is from revenue growth versus synergies. So now that we consider a couple of the revenue headwinds, how much should the revenues in that business should be up this year? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Again, I think we called out when we did the deal, 10% and 20%. Right. There's a lot of operating leverage in that business below the line, so we built an internal plan that had total Comdata without SVS, call it, in the low teens on the top, and as I said earlier, kind of mid to high 20s on the bottom. And despite the opt-out thing that I called out, it'll still be, we think, 10-plus on the top and 20-plus on the bottom this year. 
Philip Stiller: Okay, good to hear. Last question, I guess, on the acquisition pipeline. Balance sheet's starting to look better. How does the deals look in the pipeline? 
Ronald F. Clarke: They look the same, Phil. We are working on a series of things, some early, some kind of in the middle. And actually, we just had a board meeting last week to review our liquidity, and we've got plenty of liquidity there in our line that we can draw on to do transactions. And second, we're coming out a bit the other side of a lot of Comdata work. It's about, what, 9 months, I guess, since we signed. So I'd say we are eager if we can -- we could find the thing that we like. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of James Schneider with Goldman Sachs. 
James Schneider: I was wondering if you could maybe address the opportunities that you're seeing from European oil companies and any sense of the timing for when you could see more RFPs come to bid? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, James. It's Ron. I don't think much has changed on that front. The same likely suspects are evaluating. Some are in RFI mode. Some are in RFP mode. And I'd say, as I mentioned, we're grinding along trying to brief them and get them comfortable. As I've said in some of the prior calls, I think all of them want to see how we and WEX do with Shell and Exxon and make sure we do a good job, have the right proof, the right kind of confidence. So I'd say again that there's big clients with big portfolios that are evaluating the thing, and we'll see when they'll finally pull the trigger. 
James Schneider: That's helpful. And then on the virtual cards, could you maybe update us on your efforts to expand either different verticals beyond the kind of construction healthcare verticals you're in now? And maybe any talk about how the sales and marketing investments you're making in those 2 verticals are playing out? 
Ronald F. Clarke: That's a great question. We've identified a couple of others. I'm not going to call out what they are, but 2 additional verticals beyond the 2 that you named. It fit our screen in terms of the kind of clients, the kind of merchant that work the economics, the characteristics that make those attractive. And then second, we completed a big growth piece of work that we commissioned a couple of months ago and have started investing. We put millions into the budget, I think I've mentioned before, to step up spending in a bunch of areas. And so for example in construction, we've got a good position, but it's tiny against the potential. So we're doubling down on that vertical and also in the direct to the horizontal area. So we are eager to build up that business, and we're spending money right now to do it. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Lipton with Autonomous Research. 
Matt Lipton: Just the first on Brazil. I'm not sure it's been mentioned on the call. It's the number of other fintech companies this quarter have talked about -- that do business in Brazil have talked about becoming more cautious in the environment there. And you have unique products in Brazil. So I guess any update, either Ron or Eric, would just be helpful on Brazil first? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I think that call-out, Matt, is right. I think the thing went from a darling when we get in; whatever, 3, 4, 5 years ago to less so today, and obviously, that affects employment-related products right in the conversion of formal employment. So we would concur with other people that the environment is not the greatest. But for us, going from having, call it, a couple of products, including kind of a paper toll product to having the market-leading food card, the market-leading fuel card and now an electronic toll product, I'd say that the opportunity -- and again, we're pouring a lot of money in the opportunity for us to grow these new lines, despite kind of a flat economy, we still think is terrific. So the core business we have isn't going anywhere too fast because of those reasons, but we think the new lines of business will. 
Matt Lipton: Just a quick follow-up there. When -- have you just launched the new lines in the electronic products, or have those been in the market for a while? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean, if you kind of run through the 3 products that we did a deal, we get a food card product which we started marketing in a big way in the fall, so call that 6 or 8 months; the new fuel card product went live, call it, a couple of months ago; and literally, as we're speaking here, the electronic toll product. So everything is, call it, 6 months new. 
Matt Lipton: Okay, that's great. And then just a follow-up on M&A. On the last call, obviously, you talked about Comdata being what was holding up the corp dev team's plate. I think during the quarter you made some comments that, that was pushed down to the operating units. I mean, is SVS big enough that it's also a hurdle for the corporate development team to work on deals, or can those things happen in tandem? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, they obviously can happen in tandem. We've got a bank that's helping us on the SVS work, which has given our guys some leverage. And again, we continue to work the relationships that we have, and we are actively looking at a set of things now. So we're back and busy on it. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. 
Glenn Greene: Just a couple of questions. Could you give us a sense for what the Comdata revenue and margin contribution was in the quarter? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes. Glenn, this is Eric. In total, the Comdata revenue was approximately $145 million. From a margin contribution perspective, I don't have that number specifically. We have taken that business and kind of merged certain segments of the business with some of other FleetCor businesses, so it's kind of hard to dissect that. But as a general rule, when we bought that business, the margin profile was a little bit lower than FleetCor's. And obviously, our objective is to, through revenue synergies and cost synergies, obviously, to increase the profitability of that business and make it more in line with the FleetCor average. But to-date, it is a little below the FleetCor average. 
Glenn Greene: Okay. And that $145 million, is there a way to frame that growth? Was is in that 10% range or a little bit lower than that and you're going to sort of build to that 10% range over time? 
Eric R. Dey: It's the latter. We grew that business. If you exclude the SVS business, I think that grew organically around 7% in the quarter. And obviously, it's our stated objective effectively to get to that business to grow more in the 10% organic range. And again, we've just started with the integration process and are starting to invest more money in sales and marketing, and it takes time to actually build up that capability. So we should see, hopefully, those numbers increase as we get towards the end of the year and into next year. 
Glenn Greene: Just remind me, the corporate... 
Operator: Mr. Greene, we lost your line.
 [Technical Difficulty] 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Willi with Wells Fargo. 
Timothy Willi: First, I had one set of housekeeping questions, Eric, then a question for Ron on the virtual card. But I just want to make sure I have organic growth rates correct. You gave them out several times. I just want to make sure. You said North American fleet constant fuel price was 14% organic. Is that correct? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Correct. 
Eric R. Dey: That is correct. 
Timothy Willi: Okay. And the 9% constant currency, constant fuel for international getting to 11% in aggregate for the corporation. Is that all correct? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Pre-Comdata. 
Eric R. Dey: Pre-Comdata. The 9%, post-Comdata. 
Timothy Willi: Okay, 11% pre, 9% post. Got you. Okay. Great. Very helpful. Going next to the virtual card, and I get a follow-up. I think it was Matt's question. Ron, going back to sort of the opt-out and that question, obviously, that's a product that costs the recipient of the payments probably 2-plus percent and they  balk at that because they know they're going to get their ACH filed for their checks. I guess, when you think about the profitability of that business versus the growth and driving the market particularly as you go to different verticals and more horizontal, is -- or what part of the game plan potentially be to sacrifice some of those economics either through rebates for people to accept it and/or to channel partners to get out there and push the product a lot more? Are you willing to try to protect the economics as they look now and just take it at whatever pace the market allows you? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I think, Tim, it's probably too early to call. I think you're on a good point. Obviously, there are some merchants who reject the payment method out right and then others who take it and then choose to opt out. And to your point, if you made a different proposal, like a Comdata direct that didn't have the same interchange or requiring rates you might get those people back. But I think, again, the thing is still roaring. It's early days. There's tons of markets. There's tons of merchants taking it. There's a lot of benefits versus taking pay for even ACH in terms of the recon and stuff. And so I'd say our early view is there's enough interest in the benefits of this thing and it's growing fast enough that we're going to kind of leaving it at as it is for now and take a look a different day. 
Timothy Willi: And if I could just follow-up, obviously, you guys have shown to be very diligent about innovating and creating product on top of the fleet platforms and other stuff you bought into as you've gotten to know this business. You see lots of opportunities around this -- the core of the product for product innovation, whether it's software or data or what have you that would maybe help drive acceptance further? 
Ronald F. Clarke: That's a really, really good question. We're actually in the middle of that project right now. We've gone back and underwritten a huge study on both the AR and the AP side to try to understand whether we need a more holistic offering for AP people. And then your point, is there a different set of services we could provide on the supplier, on the merchant side to make them happier? And so we've got, as you can imagine, a number of ideas, and so we're kind of working through that. But the answer is, yes, we will clearly broaden the things we do for both sides of the wheel there over time. 
Operator: Thank you. That is all the questions that we have in queue at this time. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And thank you for your participation.

===== 2014 Q4  (2015-02-05 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the FleetCor Technologies Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. And a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Eric Dey, Chief Financial Officer for FleetCor Technologies. Thank you. Mr. Dey, you may begin. 
Eric R. Dey: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. By now, everyone should have access to our fourth quarter press release. It can be found at www.fleetcor.com under the Investor Relations section.
 Throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than other companies’ similarly titled non-GAAP information.
 Quantitative reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today's press release and on our website as previously described. Also, we are providing 2015 guidance on a non-GAAP basis.
 Finally, before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements. This includes forward-looking statements about our 2015 guidance, new products and fee initiatives, and expectations regarding business development and acquisitions. They are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore, you should not put undue reliance on them.
 These results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Others are described in our Annual Report on Form 8-K (sic) [ Form 10-K ]. These documents are available on our website as previously described and at www.sec.gov.
 With that out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay, Eric, thanks. Good afternoon, and as always, we appreciate you joining today. Upfront here, I'm going to plan to cover 3 subjects: first, I'll comment on the quarter on Q4; second, I'll review some of our highlights from 2014; and then finally, I'll discuss our 2015 outlook.
 Okay, so onto the quarter. We reported Q4 results that were very strong and actually beat against our internal forecast. We reported revenue of $377 million, up 47% and cash EPS of $1.39, up 29%. So 47% top line, 29% bottom line. 
 So a good way to think about the quarter is in 3 distinct pieces, which we described in Q4 Exhibit #4, which accompanies our press release. So in that, component number one, the base or the core FleetCor business reported $1.45 in cash EPS for the quarter. Component 2, Comdata, which we owned for about 6 weeks in the quarter, contributed $70 million revenue but actually minus $0.06 in cash EPS. 
 As you may recall, we had expected Comdata to be about a cash EPS push, but higher integration, bonus, severance and advisory fees caused a bit of a negative return here.
 Then lastly, component 3, where a set of unusual adjustments that were quite positive to GAAP earnings in the aggregate but had no impact, 0 impact on our cash EPS. Eric will cover these unusual items in some detail in the section. 
 So let me go back and talk a bit about the base or the core, FleetCor business in the quarter, which is really the story of a pretty wild macro environment. So in the quarter, and particularly in December, we saw U.S. fuel prices plunge, FX weaken even more, but market spreads actually expand to really unprecedented levels.
 The net effect of these 3 factors, though, created only about a $3 million revenue positive contribution and call it $0.02 of positive cash EPS. So the happy from broader market spreads was offset by lower fuel price and weaker FX. 
 The other drivers of Q4 were: one, our MasterCard product, again, up 24% in the quarter despite $0.30 lower fuel prices. We implemented a couple of our newest oil partners, Husky and Ultramar. 
 Our CLC business was up 22%. Our U.K. business was up 16%. We got a contribution from Shell Germany, which is our new full outsourcing arrangement with Shell. It's now fully operational, contributed a few million in the quarter. And then, of course, Comdata added, again, about $70 million in the quarter. 
 So in summary, the quarter was driven by spreads being better than weak FX and low fuel price. Our big business is doing well, some of our new wins coming online and then, the addition of Comdata. 
 Lastly, and you may find this a bit surprising, our Russia business was actually up 9% in local currency despite everything going on there. 
 Okay, let me now transition over to full year 2014, in which we reported revenue of $1.2 billion, up 34% and cash EPS of $5.15, up 27%. So 34% top line, 27% bottom line for the full year.
 In terms of highlights for 2014. Here's just a few. One, we entered Germany, the fifth largest economy in the world, through our new outsourcing arrangement with Shell, went live on time in September and on budget. Two, we on-boarded some new oil partner wins in North America and progressed the implementation of our new Caltex Australia and Chevron International relationships. Three, we added a group of new executive talent, mostly in market leaders in Brazil, Germany, Canada and the U.K. 
 We completed 3 acquisitions in 2014, including the Comdata deal, our largest in history. And then finally, our stock FLT continued to perform quite well, up about 26% for 2014. 
 So look, 27% profit growth, a number of new wins, we entered Continental Europe, we added some new executive talent and we completed the Comdata deal. 
 So all in all, a very good 2014. 
 All right. So let me transition now over to our outlook for 2015. So today, we're providing guidance of $1,625,000,000 in revenue at the midpoint and $6.05 in cash EPS at the midpoint. 
 The $6.05 cash EPS reflects about 17% growth rate over 2014's $5.15. The story of 2015 is really a macro environment story. So in the $6.05 cash EPS guidance today, we're making the following environmental assumptions: one, that FX will continue to be weak all year and remain at the kind of mid-January levels; two, that U.S. fuel prices will average $2.58 a gallon, which is approximately 30% below our 2014 averages; and finally, that market spreads will be better than historic levels but worse than 2014 and produce about $20 million less in revenue for us. 
 So in aggregate, when you take these 3 factors together, they create approximately $160 million revenue headwind for us. And approximately $1 of cash EPS headwind versus 2014. So quite significant. 
 So if we bridge you back to the $6.35 cash EPS guidance we provided on October 30, at that time, we were expecting the 2,000 environment to create approximately a $0.20 headwind to our 2015 plans. But in the months since October 30, fuel prices, FX and even our market spread assumptions have dramatically worsened, which has added about $0.80 of incremental cash EPS headwind to our 2015 plan.
 But we decided to reduce guidance about $0.30 from $6.35 in October to $6.05 today, and our plan is to power through the additional $0.50 headwind by doing a few things: one, accelerating Comdata's cost and price synergies; two, implementing some price recovery initiatives; and three, fortunately relying on some better exit rates or better fundamentals in our base business. 
 Look, obviously, we don't know how the environment will actually play out this year. But if it turns favorable either later this year or next, we could get back some of this dollar and cash EPS headwind. 
 So lastly, let me comment just a bit on Comdata. We're expecting Comdata to make a meaningful contribution this year in 2015, and our plan is to grow Comdata earnings about 20% over 2014 pro forma, and that assumes that we'll own SVS for only one quarter. 
 So look, it's hard to plan a business like ours that faces this amount of environmental shock. But the good news is that we would have guided to a much higher, much higher 2015 EPS estimate had the environment stayed constant. And second, our assumptions are calling for sustained low fuel prices and weak FX, which could obviously go in a better direction over time. 
 So with that, let me turn the call back over to Eric, so that he can provide some more information on the quarter, the year and our outlook. Eric? 
Eric R. Dey: Thank you, Ron. For the fourth quarter of 2014, we reported revenue of $376.7 million, an increase of 47% from the fourth quarter of 2013. Comdata, which was acquired on November 14, 2014, contributed approximately 27 percentage points of the revenue growth or $70 million to the fourth quarter of 2014 results.
 The revenue from our North American segment increased 97% to $246.7 million from $125.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Revenue from our International segment was approximately flat at $130 million in the fourth quarter of both 2014 and 2013, due primarily to unfavorable foreign exchange rates in the quarter.
 For the fourth quarter of 2014, GAAP net income increased 61% to $109.5 million or $1.21 per diluted share from $68.1 million or $0.80 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2013. Included in GAAP net income in the fourth quarter of 2014 was an estimated loss of approximately $19 million related to the Comdata acquisition, including all deal-related expenses of approximately $26 million, and approximately $29 million in gain from unusual items reflecting adjustments to purchase accounting entries for contingent consideration and tax indemnifications for the company's 2013 acquisitions of DB and VB in Brazil. 
 The other financial metrics that we routinely use are adjusted revenues and adjusted net income, which we sometimes also refer to as cash net income or cash EPS. Adjusted revenues equal our GAAP revenues less merchant commissions. We use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate the company's revenues, net of the commissions that are paid to merchants who participate in certain card programs. 
 A reconciliation of adjusted revenues and adjusted net income to GAAP numbers are provided in Exhibit 1 of our press release. Adjusted revenues in the fourth quarter of 2014 increased 44% to $343.4 million compared to $237.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Comdata contributed approximately 29 percentage points of the adjusted revenue growth or $70 million to the fourth quarter of 2014 results. 
 Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2014 increased 37% to $125.8 million or $1.39 per diluted share compared to $92.1 million or $1.08 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2013. Included in adjusted net income per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2014 was an estimated loss of approximately $0.06 per diluted share related to the Comdata acquisition, including all deal-related expenses.
 For the fourth quarter of 2014, transaction volumes increased 321% to 379.1 million transactions compared to 90.1 million transactions in the fourth quarter of 2013.
 North American segment transactions grew 682%, driven primarily by the acquisition of Comdata on November 14 and organic growth in our U.S. businesses. Transaction volumes in our International segment grew 2% and were primarily impacted by organic growth in the business. 
 For a discussion on revenue per transaction, we are going to exclude the impact of the SVS business, which had approximately 270 million transactions in the quarter at a very low revenue per transaction. 
 Revenue per transaction for the fourth quarter of 2014, excluding the SVS business, increased 17% to $3.31 from $2.84 in the fourth quarter of 2013.
 Revenue per transaction can vary based on the geography, the relevant merchant and customer relationship, the payment product utilized and the types of products or services purchased. 
 The revenue mix is influenced by our acquisitions, organic growth in the business and fluctuations in the macroeconomic environment. When we talk about the macroeconomic environment, we are referring to the impact that market fuel spread margins, fuel prices, foreign exchange rates and the economy in general can have on our business. 
 Fuel spread margins for the quarter were at record levels in the U.S., which resulted in a favorable impact to revenues in the fourth quarter. And although we cannot precisely calculate the impact of these changes, we believe it positively impacted our revenues in the North American segment by approximately $24 million in the quarter. 
 Changes in foreign exchange rates were unfavorable in all geographies for the quarter and overall, we believe negatively impacted revenue during the quarter by approximately $11 million. 
 And finally, fuel prices decreased during the quarter, and although we cannot precisely calculate the impact of these changes, we believe negatively impacted revenues by approximately $10 million. 
 So in total, the macroeconomic environment was very mixed, but overall, had an approximately $3 million favorable impact to FleetCor's consolidated revenues. 
 Revenue per transaction, excluding SVS, for the fourth quarter was up in the North America segment and down slightly in the International segment. 
 Revenue per transaction increased 29% in North America, due primarily to the higher fuel spread margins during the quarter, the positive mix impact of signing up customers who use higher revenue per transaction products than the average, organic growth in many of our higher margin products and the Comdata acquisition, excluding SVS, completed in the fourth quarter. 
 These positive factors were partially offset by the impact of lower fuel prices in the quarter. 
 In the International segment, revenue per transaction decreased 2% due primarily to unfavorable foreign exchange rates in all of our geographies. This unfavorable impact was partially offset by organic revenue growth in several lines of business, particularly in the U.K. 
 Now let's shift over and discuss some of the other drivers of our fourth quarter performance. For our North American segment, most of our lines of business performed well, resulting in approximately 41% organic growth rate in the quarter, excluding the impact of the Comdata acquisition. 
 Some of the positive drivers in North America revenues during the quarter were similar to the last several quarters, including the exceptional performance of our MasterCard product, which had revenue growth of approximately 24% over the fourth quarter of 2013, which included the approximate $0.30 drop in fuel prices versus prior year, driven primarily by increases in volume. 
 The CLC Group, provider of our lodging card programs, had another solid quarter, with 22% revenue growth over the fourth quarter of 2013. This revenue growth was driven primarily by increases in our CheckINN Direct product, which targets smaller accounts. 
 As I mentioned earlier, record fuel spread margins in the quarter positively impacted our revenue for the quarter by approximately $24 million, partially offset by the impact of lower fuel prices during the quarter of approximately $10 million. 
 And finally, the fourth quarter also benefited from our acquisition of Comdata, which closed in November of 2014 and contributed approximately $70 million in revenue for the quarter. 
 Results in our International business were impacted by strong organic growth in our U.K. business, which posted double-digit revenue growth over last year in local currency and the rollout of Shell Germany, which went live in August. 
 As of now, the economy in Russia remains soft, and foreign exchange rates continue to be unfavorable. However, in spite of these headwinds, our business in Russia continues to be up from the prior year in local currency. 
 Organic growth in the International segment was approximately 8% for the fourth quarter in constant currency; however, as I mentioned earlier, unfavorable foreign exchange rates in all geographies negatively impacted revenues by approximately $11 million in the quarter.
 Now moving down the income statement. Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $204.1 million compared to $149.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, an increase of 37%. 
 As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses decreased to 54.2% of revenue compared to 58.5% in the fourth quarter of 2013. Included in operating expenses are merchant commissions, processing expenses, bad debt, selling and general administrative expense, depreciation and amortization expense and other operating net. 
 Included in the fourth quarter operating expense were normal operating expenses related to Comdata for the period of time that we owned the business in 2014. In addition, Comdata recorded deal-related expenses of approximately $26 million, including legal fees, accounting, tax and various advisers and severance, et cetera. 
 Also included in operating expenses for the quarter was approximately a $29 million gain in unusual items, reflecting adjustments to purchase accounting entries for contingent consideration and tax indemnification for the company's 2013 acquisitions of DB and VB in Brazil. So quite a few moving parts for the quarter. 
 Credit losses were $6.3 million for the quarter or 13 basis points compared to $4.8 million or 10 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2013. The slight increase in bad debt was primarily due to the inclusion of Comdata operations for part of the quarter in 2014. 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 56% to $37.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 from $24.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. The increase was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets related to the Comdata acquisition. 
 Interest expense increased 140% to $13.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 from $5.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. The increase in interest expense was due primarily to additional borrowing to finance the Comdata acquisition. 
 Also, the company booked $15.8 million for loss on extinguishment of debt related to the new financing for the Comdata acquisition. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2014 was 21.9% compared to 31.9% for the fourth quarter of 2013. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due primarily to a $9.5 million reversal of a deferred tax liability established in conjunction with the DB acquisition in Brazil and as a result of the completion of some entity consolidation. Also, the fourth quarter of 2013 includes an unfavorable income tax adjustment related to changes in the tax law in Mexico, which required the company to record $1.5 million of additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2013. 
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $612 million in total cash, approximately $135 million of which is restricted and are primarily customer deposits. 
 On October 24, we signed documents to enter into a new $3.355 billion credit facility, consisting of a Term A loan of $2,020,000,000, a revolving credit facility of $1,035,000,000 and a Term B loan of $300 million. 
 These new bank facilities are used to refinance our existing Term A loan and revolving credit facility and help finance the Comdata acquisition. 
 At year-end, we had approximately $2,020,000,000 outstanding on our Term A loan, $250 million outstanding on our Term B loan and $648 million drawn on our revolver, leaving $387 million of undrawn availability. 
 Also, on November 14, we entered into a new 3-year $1.2 billion AR securitization facility in conjunction with the Comdata acquisition. 
 At December 31, we had approximately $675 million borrowed against the facility. As of December 31, 2014, our leverage ratio was 3.05x EBITDA. The 3.05x EBITDA is well below our covenant level of 4.25x EBITDA. We intend to use our free cash flow to temporary pay down the balance on our revolving credit facility and securitization facility and maintain liquidity for acquisitions and other corporate purposes. 
 Finally, we are not a capital-intensive business, and we spent only $8.1 million on CapEx during the fourth quarter of 2014, including approximately $2 million on Comdata. 
 Now onto our outlook for 2015. For 2015, we have a number of macroeconomic headwinds affecting our business, primarily foreign exchange rates and fuel prices. We are estimating that foreign exchange rates will negatively impact revenue by approximately $65 million compared to the 2014 average, and the absolute price of fuel is expected to be a headwind of revenue of approximately $75 million versus 2014 average. 
 In addition, we believe market spreads will be better than historic levels, but contribute approximately $20 million less revenue than 2014 spreads. 
 In aggregate, these 3 environmental factors create approximately $160 million revenue headwind and approximately $1 cash EPS headwind versus the 2014 averages.
 That being said, we expect total revenues to be between $1.6 billion and $1,650,000,000; adjusted net income to be between $560 million and $580 million; and adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $5.95 and $6.15 or $6.05 at the midpoint. 
 Our adjusted net income per diluted share guidance at the midpoint of the range represents a 17% growth rate over the $5.15 per diluted share reported in 2014, despite the macroeconomic headwinds mentioned above. 
 Also in Ron's remarks, he provided the bridge from our preliminary guidance of $6.35 and adjusted net income per diluted share that we provided on our third quarter conference call on October 30 versus our current guidance. 
 At that time, we were expecting the 2015 macro environment to create approximately a $0.20 headwind to our 2015 guidance. But since that time, fuel prices, foreign exchange rates and market spread assumptions have continued to worsen, adding an incremental $0.80 headwind to our 2015 plan. 
 However, despite this, we have reduced our guidance by only $0.30 from $6.35 to $6.05 at the midpoint and expect to offset the additional $0.50 by accelerating Comdata's cost and price synergies, implementing some price recovery initiatives and relying on better 2014 exit rates or better fundamentals in the business. 
 As Ron said earlier, we don't know how the environment will actually play out in 2015, but if it improves, either later this year or next, some of the $1 headwind may come back as a tailwind. 
 Some of the assumptions that we have made in preparing this guidance include the following: weighted fuel prices equal to $2.58 per gallon average for 2015 compared to $3.56 per gallon average in 2014; market spreads slightly better than average levels in the first quarter of 2015, neutral in the second quarter and worse in the third and particularly fourth quarters; foreign exchange rates equal to the 7-day average ended January 13, 2015. We are including the SVS business in the first quarter guidance as we expect to own the business for the entire quarter.
 We expect continued weakness in the company's Russian business, a full year tax rate of 32.1%, fully diluted shares outstanding of 94.3 million shares and no impact related to acquisitions or material new partnership agreements not already disclosed. 
 For those of you that are looking for guidance for the first quarter, I want to remind everyone that our business has some seasonality and that typically, the first quarter is the lowest in terms of both revenue and profit. First quarter seasonality is impacted by weather, holidays in the U.S., Christmas being celebrated in Russia in January and lower business levels in Brazil, where most businesses are on summer break in the first quarter and the Carnival celebration in the first quarter as well. 
 Also, as we previously disclosed, we are exploring the possible sale of the SVS business that we acquired with Comdata. In any event, we expect to own the business in the first quarter and are including the SVS business in the first quarter guidance. With that said, we are expecting our first quarter adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $1.38 and $1.42. 
 Our first quarter guidance at the midpoint represents a 25% increase versus prior year. For the second quarter, we are expecting adjusted net income per diluted share to be similar to the first quarter, and the second quarter excludes any impact related to SVS. Additionally, our volume is built throughout the year and our new asset initiatives gained momentum throughout the year, resulting in a much higher earnings per share in the third and fourth quarters. 
 We also have no plans to provide quarterly guidance going forward, but rather to update our annual guidance each quarter. 
 And with that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from David Togut of Evercore ISI. 
David Togut: Thank you for providing the helpful detail on macro factors. You said that your plan would have been $7 in cash EPS, excluding the 3 macro factors you called out, which would have been about a 36% gain in cash EPS for 2015. Can you talk about the underlying assumptions behind the $7, just so we can understand where the business would have been on a constant currency basis and holding fuel price and fuel spread impacts flat year-over-year? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Dave. It's Ron. So in constant currency, the plan is basically organic revenue growth was targeted at 10% for this year, for '15. And then second, we have, as you can imagine, some initiatives, both revenue and cost synergies, both in the Comdata deal and some of our previous assets. So those will be the 2 core drivers, basically, of the growth. 
David Togut: And you called out 20% expected growth in Comdata earnings for this year. What would that have added up to just on an accretion basis on a per share metric? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, we're not going to provide the exact number, but what I would say is that thing is penciling out to be a bit better than the numbers we quoted back in the fall. I think we gave you $0.50 to $0.60, if I recall, and I'd say it's coming in a little bit stronger, Dave, than that. And remember, the reason why is that the Comdata has obviously 0 FX impact because it's all here. And then b, there's kind of only one line of business that has any kind of significant fuel price impact. So it's not affected nearly as much as the core FleetCor business. 
David Togut: I see. And then... 
Ronald F. Clarke: We bought that. It's a good thing to buy in this macro environment. 
David Togut: It certainly helps. If I -- If we look at international, you had over 60% growth in earnings internationally. Was there any benefit from higher spreads from AllStar in the quarter? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, there's almost no spread impact. There's only one business there, which we call TSEC, that has any spread impact and it was de minimis, call it $1 million. 
David Togut: Got it. And then in this environment, Ron, with oil prices down so much, are you seeing an increased propensity to outsource by the big oil companies? 
Ronald F. Clarke: You know I think there's more talk, David. Obviously, they're looking for all kinds of ways to reduce costs. We've actually gotten some calls, as you can imagine, the last 30 days. But I'd say it's still early days. 
David Togut: Understood. And then just shifting gears to possible Visa Europe card, which you've talked about in the past. Any update there now that it seems that the European regulators will exclude commercial cards from regulations? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, which is obviously a little bit of "good environmental news." So the update there, again, we have 2 different products. So in the U.K., we have a deal with Visa and that product, which we call our AllStar Premiere card, is actually in market. I think we have 2,000 to 3,000 cards actually live, working. So we've got that kind of in a controlled environment to make sure it works well. And then second is our more generic universal card, which -- what we've launched in Germany, and that thing is in kind of its final field test now. And we expect to put clients literally live on that product next month in Germany. 
David Togut: And then do you have a specific plan to roll that out throughout Europe as you roll out the Shell business? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. The plan, just to remind, is to go into another 5 or 6 markets later this spring, kind of May, June. And so if we have success with the universal card in Germany, the idea would be to follow along and launch it in those other markets. 
David Togut: Just a quick final question for me. Do you have growth assumptions for 2015 for direct MasterCard and CLC? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. And they're both, as you can imagine, high, both high double-digits again for 2015. 
Operator: And next question comes from Philip Stiller of Citi. 
Philip Stiller: Appreciate all the detail and the guidance. So I guess one thing I was wondering about was the assumptions around SVS. Perhaps, if you could give us some detail in terms of revenue or earnings contribution for the time of ownership that you're assuming? And then if there's any assumptions in the guidance about use of proceeds if you do end up selling the business? 
Eric R. Dey: Hey Phil, this is Eric. I would say, first and foremost, from a contribution perspective, I mean, it wasn't a lot. It's a smaller, obviously, piece of the business from a profit respective. So it was low single-digit cents in cash net income for the quarter. And what's the second part of that your question again, Phil? 
Philip Stiller: Any details in revenue, and then if you're making assumptions about paying down debt with any percent you might get? 
Eric R. Dey: From a revenue perspective, we didn't provide any specific detail on one product or one particular line of business. So we're really not going to comment on that specifically. And regarding sale, if we do sell the business, what we would do with the proceeds. We do not have any of that built into our guidance. So obviously, if we took cash proceeds and paid down debt, that would have an incremental benefit to our P&L. 
Philip Stiller: Okay, great. And something you guys might be able to provide a little bit more detail in terms of Comdata synergies. I know it's obviously a big target of yours. Just wondering if you could tell us what you're assuming in the guidance. And then, Ron, I think maybe you said the Comdata earnings would grow 20% beyond '15. So I just want to make sure we're not pushing stuff into this year and the growth beyond this year is not 20%. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, we've accelerated. So we basically have gotten the cost synergies locked. There's of bunch redundant things we chase, so that's in the sort of $10 million to $15 million range. But I think I told you this, we've elected in our plan to basically reinvest those dollars into sales and marketing because we want to try to grow the businesses. So from the cost synergy side, we've got that money, but we've kind of turned around and poured it back in the growth. And I'd say, we've made good progress on the revenue synergy side and again, we've accelerated a bit of that into this year because of these headwinds. And that's quite a bit bigger than the cost synergies, so it is -- I'd say, it's pretty significant. And in terms of yes, earnings, so the number 20% that we quote is basically excluding SVS. We take kind of the pro forma from '14 without SVS, look at our plan for '15, net things up in earnings; pretax, above 20%. And yes, our 3-year model is to grow that thing 20%-plus, '15, '16 and '17, which again was a key for us to do that trade so that asset could grow at the FleetCor line average target, which again is 20%. 
Philip Stiller: Good to hear. Last question, and then I'll turn it over. You mentioned price realization. Just wondering, I guess, is this something that's kind of a nice byproduct of the lower fuel price environment that perhaps allows you to push that further this year? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, look, I think whenever an end client's total bill drops by 30%, to someone spending $100,000 a month on fuel and the thing goes down to $70,000 to get a couple of bucks for what we do, I think, is easier. But I wouldn't say it's super easy. Everybody's pinching pennies. And so we've been very, very thoughtful as part of that pieces of where Comdata maybe has opportunities that didn't take advantage of, and that's where we have gone. We're trying be very, very careful in protecting those -- the relationships and the volume, but basically, kind of taking money where we can. So again, a lot of that is really already in place, sitting here the 1st of February. So I'd say, our confidence is pretty high there. 
Operator: And next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal of Jefferies. 
Ramsey El-Assal: A bit of a follow-up question. You mentioned that  one of the levers, obviously, that might be able to work to offset some of the macro headwind is price. Can you be any more specific about sort of which parts of your business contain the larger pricing opportunities? Anything about specific segments or geographies or products? Or is it more of a uniform statement across-the-board? Or how should we think about that? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Ramsey, that's a good question. I would say that we obviously looked everywhere, right, when we saw these headwinds at the end of last year. I'd say that probably some fair amount of it is planned here where the fuel price impact is greater. But I'd say, of the total number that we're chasing, 40% of it is International, maybe 60% is here. And obviously, we looked at all kinds of things. We look at floors, on merchant contracts, when prices drop, we look at rebate levels we give people -- we look at interest rate levels. So we look across every lever, everywhere and decide which things impact kind of customers least to make sure we kind of spread the thing around, and we're obviously testing our way into a bunch of those things to make sure there's not a big impact. But I'd say, again, it's ground that we've covered before and I think, again, we've got pretty good confidence in it. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. Switching gears on SVS. Is there a probability we should assign to you guys hanging on to this asset on a more permanent basis? Or are you really still quite set on divesting it, just taking your time trying to find the right opportunity? Or how should we think about SVS long term? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, again, I'd say, the honest answer is we don't know. I'll give you a bit of not of an update that we think there's more interest in the asset than maybe we had thought. And so I'd say that it's probably more likely than not that we would sell that asset. But I'd say it's still too early to call. Ask me in 60 days. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay, last one for me is just about the M&A pipeline in '15. I mean, granted it's not on an organic basis but it could also theoretically contribute to closing some of the gap from numbers from the macro environment. What is the -- how would -- how should we gauge the kind of quality of your M&A pipeline here and your appetite to kind of to do deals while you're digesting Comdata? Are you moving on parallel tracks? Or is this something that we should kind of not expect as much of this year than prior cycles? 
Ronald F. Clarke: No, no. Our appetite is high. Again, we did a lot of that work as we signed last summer and we've got into the target that we had kind of 3x and obviously, we're delevering from here. We've got, Eric, what? $400 million, $500 million in liquidity in the current lines that we have today? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes, that's correct. 
Ronald F. Clarke: So I -- and we've transitioned, Ramsey, most of the Comdata integration work to our ops people, if you will, not our deal team. So I'd say that our plan and the objective for me and that deal team is to put $1.5 billion to $2 billion to work over 3 years. And I'd say that this is the game we're in. We like assets and getting assets and doing things. And so sitting here today in front of me, we've got 3 or 4 conversations on the deal side and looking at, call it, 3 or 4 conversations on the partner side now that we're in. I'd say, I characterize them as generally earlier innings. I wouldn't say any of these are kind of Q1, but I would say that our expectations is we're going to try to do something on both partners and deals in this year. We've got the liquidity, we've got the management. And so if one of these things looks right, then we'll go forward. 
Operator: And next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: So just a follow-up to Ramsey's question. The strong dollar, Ron, does that entice you to be more aggressive in bidding on International assets? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, we like that, Tien-tsin. Yes, for sure. 
Eric R. Dey: Spending money is good. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Yes, so that does open things up. But it sounds like the pipeline hasn't changed too much. Is that a fair statement? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, it's always, Tien-tsin, if you're looking at what we look at, right, there's things coming in and some that's frozen out as fuel prices collapse, so sellers decide to hold, new things come in. So I'd say that even though we say to you guys, "Hey, we're looking at some number of things," don't -- obviously don't assume it's the same 3 or 4 things today that we were looking at last summer when you would have asked. But we've got people out. Like I've said, we've got relationships everywhere, so we're active in contacting people and trying to get people into conversations all the time. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Okay. That's good to know. And then I heard that Russian came in up 9%, but International growth looked like it was slowed a little bit to 2%, as I see this right here. So what's -- was that a surprise relative to plan? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, it's FX, Tien-tsin. So again, if you look at our Russia business in the quarter, frankly, we -- I was a bit shocked just to see that business was, with everything going on, up 9% local currency. It's not in front of me, but I think the thing was still up something for the full year in local currency. But I think the currency is down, Eric, close to what, 50%? 3-year? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes, typically... 
Ronald F. Clarke: So when you convert the thing, it's obviously way down, Tien-tsin, for both the quarter and the year. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: How about just overall transaction growth for International? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes, transaction growth, Tien-tsin, in the quarter and internationally was a couple of percent and obviously, it was lot higher than that on a full year basis, around 18%. So it's going to vary by geography as you would imagine. So some parts of the world are a little stronger than others. The U.K. is performing fairly well and then there's other parts of the world that have been a little softer, like Brazil. I think we've called that out on a couple of other calls. The economy there has softened, which has certainly impacted volumes. The Czech Republic is a little bit soft as well. But again, that's just the way it goes. Some businesses are doing -- are very strong and some are impacted by economies in some other geographies. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Tien-tsin, I'd just add, which is a little bit funny. When we're kind of closing out our budget with our board at the end of the year, and the world was moving, right, moving the wrong way, the that's kind of fascinating is we were able to take up our numbers a bit because the fundamentals, both volume and rate, sans the fuel price and the FX, are actually better and we're exiting, as I said in my comments, better than we thought. So if you can wave away all the smoke here, I'd say things are actually healthier here at FleetCor than they've been. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: All right, great. That's good to hear. Just one more if you don't mind. Just the tax rate, I guess, is going up. You didn't call that out as a headwind, but it looks like it's $0.17 drag to our numbers. So tax rate is going up to 32%, is that a sustainable level? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes, Tien-tsin, I mean, it really isn't changing a whole lot from 2014. We had kind of $9.5 million tax favorability that we recognized in the quarter related to some purchase accounting true-ups in Brazil. So it's a one-time noncash favorability. We had to book the tax expense. Excluding that, taxes came in more in the 30%, 31% range. And the difference between where we ended the year and next year is purely due to Comdata, which is mostly in the United States. And, as you know, it's a much higher tax rate than we would expect internationally. 
Operator: The next question comes from Darrin Peller of Barclays. 
Darrin Peller: Just a quick -- very quickly to follow up on all the discussion around deals. I mean, I think in the past, you've been saying now $750 million potential capital use per year for acquisitions. Is that still on track despite sort of all the noise in the environment? And then just a couple of more operating questions. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Darrin, it's Ron. Kind of the goal we have in the company is we think about spending our free cash flow. I don't have it in front of me, but I think the number's around $600 million this year. And if you look at our model, that thing, obviously, is growing 20%. So that's the right zip code, kind of $600 million, $700 million, $800 million, call it, $1.5 billion to $2 billion over 3 years. And I think the appetite question was a good one earlier. It's what we do, right? A big part of the game of the company is finding assets that we know and working them. And so I'd say, that we're still eager to do that. 
Darrin Peller: Great. Just -- like, I mean, just to help deconstruct this extra $0.50 embedded in your guidance basically, given that you're really only moving it by 30 despite $0.80 headwind. Again, you broke down pricing potential exit run rate being stronger and then synergies from Comdata. I guess I'm just trying to figure out, is this basically -- usually, you guys still maintain and leave some conservatism from synergy potential from deals. I mean, would this kind of use it all up in a way, is what I'm kind of getting at, or is there still more opportunity in Comdata than what maybe you're even potentially including here that could come? And then maybe just help us deconstruct if there's -- how much of this is from pricing? Or just overall core strength in the business versus Comdata would be really helpful. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I think that's a good question. I'd say that we've spent an awful lot of time studying the Comdata business and had a whole set of ideas of how to improve profit performance. And I'd say that the major difference is just pace. So when you look at the kind of the 3-year plan, we had kind of staged, "Hey, we're going to do 1, 2, 3 in '15 and we're going to do 4, 5, 6." And I'd say because of these headwinds, we elected to accelerate a few of the things that we had thought about initially, sooner. So I'd say that there's still a bunch of things that we haven't pulled the trigger on there because we kind of -- we're looking at it over a 3-year plan. So I'd say that the one is about pace. And then on the rest of the question, I'd say, think about it as, call it, 1/3 of the clawback is through fundamentals and exit rates, and kind of the other 2/3 is Comdata and kind of price recovery. And I think my comment earlier is we study everywhere globally, tweak prices and not do a lot with the clients. So again, I think we've picked what we think is smart and balanced and, of course, we could always push harder. But we pick what we've analyzed. I could have pushed and kept guidance the same. But I think we're trying to run the company to make profit growth 20% every year, not just this year. And so I think we took what we think makes some sense. 
Darrin Peller: And that's really helpful. Just one last question. Moving away from Comdata, the -- it looked like International margins were strong. So just a quick comment on the sort of synergies remaining internationally from some of those deals will be helpful. And the I'll just turn it back to the queue. 
Eric R. Dey: Darrin, this is Eric. Yes, I want to remind everybody, if you go back and listen to my script, we had some one-time favorabilities that were booked into the quarter, and they were International. So we have booked about $30 million of, I would say, purchase accounting reserve reversals into the quarter. And unfortunately, GAAP rules now require us to take those adjustments to the P&L versus to the balance sheet and leave it in purchase accounting. So again, we had about $30 million of one-time favorability in there. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Darrin, let me just -- it's Ron, let me just add to that. I think sitting inside of Eric's comments, remember, we have 3 or 4 assets that we would still call new, relatively new that are getting treated. And so if you look at the U.K., we bought a company called Epyx, was it, just over a year or a couple of months ago? 
Eric R. Dey: Just over a year ago. 
Ronald F. Clarke: We've bought a couple of companies down under in Australia and New Zealand, and we went live with that Shell Germany thing that the cost structure has been in the business but not the revenue. And so I'd say that certainly, in Q4, if you looked at those assets versus the prior Q4, they are all way up in profits. I mean, way, way up in profits because we've had a chance, basically, to put our kind of Phase 1 transformation stuff into those sets of businesses and get traction. So those things, for sure, boost the margins. 
Eric R. Dey: But again, I want you to be sure, be clear here that the margins are up if you look at one of the schedules in the press release, 70%. The profit is up internationally, but 30 points of that is the one-time favorability that I was mentioning. 
Operator: The next question comes from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. 
James Schneider: With respect to some of the benefits you eventually expect to roll on towards the end of this year, namely pricing and Comdata revenue synergies, can you maybe talk about first, on the pricing, when do you expect to be able to sort of realize some of the pricing and contract actions, and when you can realize those sort of all at once given the contracts you have existing that are already in place? And then on the Comdata revenue side, is that just small over-the-road customers? And do we expect that's going to be kind of the middle of this year, or is it going to be out to the end of 2015 and into 2016 before you recognize some benefit there on the revenue side? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Jim, it's Ron. I'd say that we are, again, pretty far along on those set of revenue synergies. And I would say, think of them as big contracts that take time. We're looking everywhere, we went to obviously, both the merchant side and the customer side. We look at rebates. And so there's a whole series of places where there are -- we're more immediate. When I used the word accelerate, kind of more immediate pricing actions. So I'd say, you should think about a lot of that, kind of most of that being in our run rate, certainly, by the start of Q2. 
James Schneider: Okay. So that's both pricing and revenue from Comdata, right? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Correct. And the other comment I made earlier, which we built a bit into the plan, we basically took the cost savings, the redundancy savings and poured that back in the sales and marketing and management investments. So we are stepping up on adding people to make sales. So clearly, as you get to the back half of the year, we're assuming we're going to get some return on that incremental $10 million to $15 million. 
James Schneider: That's helpful. And then maybe as a follow-up, can you maybe comment on the European oil company partnerships, specifically? And what opportunities do you see there, whether you see there's a chance that bids could come in the first half the year, or is it more of a second half kind of phenomenon? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I mean, the first comment I'd make, I think, is the Shell one -- Shell, I think, was kind of the first guy in Europe that gave us chance on the system side. They had a project called H3 and picked our global fuel card system, call it, 3 years ago. So we've got that in x number of markets. And then maybe being first, they decided, call it, a year ago to let us do kind of a full outsourcing deal in 11 or 12 countries. And I'd say that, that second thing, and even I got the Shell guy in the room with me has gone exceptionally well. We've done those conversions, we didn't miss a beat, we didn't bum out customers. We had all the service people in place. We put sales people in place to sell. So I think the feedback, both from the customer, the partner perspective and ours, which I commented it generated a few million of brand new revenue in Q4, I think that thing is off to a good start and I think that success is making its way into the conversations that we're having with some of the other guys there, I can remember if it was Phil or someone earlier in the call who said "Hey, does the lower fuel price motivate oil companies to look for other cost reduction ideas?" and I think the answer is yes. And so I've said it before, us having success and giving partners confidence that we can do good work, I think, is the key to them picking us. 
Operator: This concludes our time for questions on today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2014 Q3  (2014-10-30 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the FleetCor Technologies Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. 
 It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Eric Dey, Chief Financial Officer for FleetCor Technologies. Thank You. Mr. Dey, you may begin. 
Eric R. Dey: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. By now, everyone should have access to our third quarter press release. It can be found at www.fleetcor.com under the Investor Relations section.
 Throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share and EBITDA. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than other companies’ similarly titled non-GAAP information.
 Quantitative reconciliation of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today's press release and on our website as previously described. Also, we are providing 2014 and preliminary 2015 guidance on a non-GAAP basis.
 Finally, before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements. This includes forward-looking statements about our 2014 and 2015 guidance, new products and fee initiatives, and expectations regarding business development and acquisitions. They are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore, you should not put undue reliance on them. These results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release and Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Others are discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. These documents are available on our website as previously described and at www.sec.gov.
 With that out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay, Eric. Thanks, and good afternoon, everyone, and as always, appreciate you joining the call. Upfront here, I'll plan to cover 2 subjects: first, I'll comment on our Q3 results and our 2014 full year guidance; and then second, I'll provide an update on the Comdata acquisition along with our outlook for 2015.
 Okay. So onto the quarter. Well, let me start by saying we're very pleased with our Q3 results. We reported earlier Q3 revenue of $295 million, up 31%; and cash EPS of $1.37, up 27%. So 31%, top line; 27%, bottom line. 
 There's quite a lot going on in the macro environment this quarter. Although on balance, we'd say that the environment was effectively neutral in terms of its impact on our results. We did get a lot of help from above-average market spreads in the range of $5 million, but that was all offset by lower U.S. fuel prices, higher interest rates and an unfavorable tax compare. 
 This Q3, our tax rate was 30% versus last year, 27%. That again reduces our earnings growth rate by about 6%, so again, reporting 27% earnings growth versus 33% at constant tax rate. 
 The drivers of our Q3 performance were quite similar to our previous quarters. So first, organic growth. Consolidated, we had organic growth of 13% in Q3, and that has accelerated from earlier in the year. Inside of that, our U.S. business was even better with organic growth of 19%, and that's driven by the above-average market spreads, continued 27% volume growth at our MasterCard products and continued mid-20s CLC growth. 
 Second driver, acquisitions. We were helped by our 3 largest 2013 acquisitions, which is NexTraq here in the U.S., Epyx in the U.K. and VB in Brazil. So collectively, these 3 deals accounted for about half of the revenue growth for the quarter. 
 Lastly, our Russia business continues to hang in, and we did report positive growth in local currency for the quarter. So hanging in there. 
 We did have a few highlights as well in Q3. We announced last month that we went live with Shell in Germany and we've now fully converted their SME portfolio onto our systems and operations, and this one market will contribute approximately $10 million of incremental revenue in 2015. Shell is quite happy with this initial conversion, and thus, we expect to convert Shell market #2, which will be Austria, hopefully, before year end. 
 Our second highlight in the quarter: we did acquire Pac Pride on August 1, so this is a nice tuck-in acquisition for us that has, we think, bright prospects for next year. 
 We also went live with our new Voyager universal card project, so we finished up the testing and we're now fully operational with this second universal product. So again, a great alternative for us to our universal MasterCard product. 
 And then lastly, we progressed quite a bit with our Husky Canada and Ultramar Canada, new partner conversions, and we expect both of these new partners to be fully converted by year end. So a pretty exciting set of developments this quarter.
 Okay. Let me transition over to Q4 and our 2014 full year guidance. So today, we are raising guidance again. We're taking cash EPS guidance up from $5.07 at the midpoint to $5.09 at the midpoint for full year 2014. This implies $1.33 in Q4 cash EPS. So assumed in this Q4 guidance is approximately $0.05 of FX headwind. That's if our major currencies stay kind of at the current levels. So obviously, we would have guided to $1.38 in Q4 had we been at constant currency. 
 For the quarter, we're expecting lower U.S. fuel prices to continue, but that will be offset by above average market spreads in Q4, and again, really that's a natural hedge for us. 
 So if we achieve the $1.33 in Q4 EPS and $5.09 in full year 2014 cash EPS, that would result in 26% cash EPS growth versus 2013. And if you look back at FleetCor's cash EPS earnings history, since our December 2010 IPO, we could report 4 years of cash EPS profit growth well in excess of our 20% annual target. So in 2011, 31% profit growth; '12, it was 38%; last year, 35%; and as I mentioned, we're outlooking 26% here in 2014. So look, we're quite pleased with the consistency of our profit growth since we've gone public.
 Okay. Let me transition over to Comdata and give you an update on that transaction. So since we spoke to you last in mid-August, we've been working quite hard on our integration plans and our financial forecast for that business, and we can now report that we have officially cleared HSR and completed our new credit facility raise. So we are now in a position to close the Comdata transaction this quarter, Q4. We don't expect any cash EPS profit contribution in the quarter as integration costs, deal costs and severance costs will likely offset any Comdata contribution.
 We must tell you, though, that we are feeling very good about the transaction today, probably even better than when we signed the deal. We really like this corporate payments business and its long-term growth potential. We've got more confidence in the synergy opportunities within the Comdata fleet business, and it looks like our financing costs will be favorable to our original model as we have achieved a higher mix of pro rata facilities versus term B facilities.
 I also want to tell you that the Comdata people have been terrific. They've embraced this transaction. They've been incredibly cooperative. They've been excited about the new ideas that we floated, and they're also accepting all the necessary changes that will be required to combine the companies and deliver the cost synergies that we anticipate. So really just great attitude.
 So okay. Let's talk about what all this means then relative to our 2015 outlook. So let me start off by saying that we haven't finished our 2015 budgeting process and still need to close the Comdata transaction. But with that, we are reconfirming today $6.35 in cash EPS guidance at the midpoint for 2015, and we're maintaining this guidance despite an expected $0.15 to $0.20 cash EPS headwind in our FleetCor business, and this is a result of unfavorable FX and expected lower U.S. fuel prices. But on the Comdata side, we are now expecting stronger earnings next year, and that's driven by 3 things: one, the company's better second half performance than we were expecting, so better exit rate; two, our confidence to realize more synergy sooner than we had originally planned; and then three, again, this lower expected financing cost due to the more favorable mix of our credit facilities. 
 So in total, we plan to stick with this preliminary 2015 cash EPS guidance of $6.35, again, despite pretty unfavorable macro conditions. The $6.35 cash EPS guidance would result in 25% earnings growth over our 2014 $5.09 full year guidance, which could potentially give us 5 consecutive years of 20% plus earnings growth.
 So with that, let me turn the call back over to Eric, so that he can provide some additional color on the quarter. Eric? 
Eric R. Dey: Thank you, Ron. For the third quarter of 2014, we reported revenue of $295.3 million, an increase of 31% from the third quarter of 2013. Revenue from our North American segment increased 35.6% to $156.3 million from $115.3 million in the third quarter of 2013. Revenue from our International segment increased 26.4% to $138.9 million from $109.9 million in the third quarter of 2013. For the third quarter of 2014, GAAP net income increased 21% to $95.5 million or $1.11 per diluted share from $78.6 million or $0.93 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2013. 
 The other financial metrics that we routinely use are adjusted revenues and adjusted net income, which we sometimes also refer to as cash net income or cash EPS. Adjusted revenues equal our GAAP revenues less merchant commission. We use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate the company's revenues, net of the commissions that are paid to merchants to participate in certain card programs. A reconciliation of adjusted revenues and adjusted net income to GAAP numbers are provided in Exhibit 1 of our press release. 
 Adjusted revenues in the third quarter of 2014 increased 30% to $270.3 million compared to $208.2 million in the third quarter of 2013. Adjusted net income for the third quarter of 2014 increased 29% to $117.6 million or $1.37 per diluted share compared to $91.4 million or $1.08 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2013. 
 However, to remind everyone, in the third quarter of 2013 was the impact of a onetime income tax benefit of approximately $0.05 per share due to the reduction in the tax rate in the U.K. Without this onetime adjustment, our adjusted net income per diluted share would have been $1.03 in the third quarter of 2013, and our year-over-year growth rate would have been approximately 33%.
 For the third quarter of 2014, transaction volumes increased 12% to 94.4 million transactions compared to 84.3 million transactions in the third quarter of 2013. North America segment transactions grew 4.5%, driven primarily by organic growth in our U.S. businesses and the telematics acquisition we completed in October of 2013. Transaction volumes in our International segment grew 19.8% and were positively impacted by acquisitions closed in 2013. Adjusted revenue per transaction for the third quarter of 2014 increased 15.9% to $2.86 from $2.47 in the third quarter of 2013. 
 Revenue per transaction can vary based on the geography, the relevant merchant and customer relationship, the payment product utilized and the types of products or services purchased. The revenue mix is influenced by our acquisitions, organic growth in the business and fluctuations in the macroeconomic environment. When we talk about the macroeconomic environment, we are referring to the impact that market spread margins, fuel prices, foreign exchange rates and the economy in general can have on our business. 
 Revenue per transaction for the third quarter was up in both North America and the International segment. The revenue per transaction was up 29.8% in North America due primarily to higher fuel spread margins during the quarter. The positive mix impact of signing up customers who use higher revenue per transaction products than the average, organic growth in many of our higher margin products and acquisitions completed in 2013 that have higher revenue per transaction products than the average. These positive factors were partially offset by the impact of lower fuel prices in the quarter. 
 In the International segment, revenue per transaction increased 5.5% due primarily to organic revenue growth in several lines of business, particularly in the U.K. and acquisitions closed in 2013, some of which have products with a higher overall revenue per transaction versus our line average. In addition, foreign exchange rates in the quarter were mixed, but overall, had a slightly positive impact on International revenue per transaction. As previously stated, higher fuel spread margins in the U.S. resulted in a favorable impact to revenues in the third quarter. And although, we cannot precisely calculate the impact of these changes, we believe it positively impacted our revenues in the North America segment by approximately $5 million for the quarter. Changes in foreign exchange rates were mixed, and overall, we believe positively impacted revenue during the quarter by approximately $1 million to $2 million. And foreign exchange rates were favorable in the U.K. and neutral to down in most other geographies.
 Now let's shift over and discuss some of the other drivers of our third quarter performance. For our North American segment, most of our lines of business performed well, resulting in a 35.6% revenue growth in the quarter versus prior year. Approximately 19% of this growth was organic growth in the quarter. Some of the positive drivers in North America revenue during the quarter were similar to the last several quarters, including the exceptional performance of our MasterCard product, which had a revenue growth of approximately 36% over the third quarter of 2013, driven primarily by increases in volume. The CLC Group, provider of our lodging and card programs, had another solid quarter with 27% revenue growth over the third quarter of 2013. This revenue growth was driven primarily by increases in our CheckINN Direct product, which targets smaller accounts. 
 The third quarter also benefited from our acquisition of NexTraq, a telematics business acquired in October of 2013. And finally, the decrease in the wholesale cost of fuel resulted in an increase in fuel spread margins, and we believe positively impacted our revenue for the quarter by approximately $5 million as I mentioned earlier. 
 Results in our International business were impacted by strong organic growth in our U.K. business, which posted double-digit revenue growth over last year. Results for International businesses were also positively impacted by acquisitions in Brazil and the U.K. in 2013. 
 I am sure a number of you are wondering how our business in Russia has been performing. As of now, not much has changed since the second quarter. The economy in Russia remains soft and foreign exchange rates continue to get worse. However, in spite of these headwinds, our business in Russia is actually up slightly from the prior year. 
 As most of you know, the dollar has been strengthening against most foreign currencies over the last month. And if this continues at the current rate, we believe it will have an unfavorable impact on our revenue and results in the fourth quarter. I'll discuss this in greater detail when I discuss full year guidance.
 Now moving down the income statement. Total operating expenses for the third quarter were $151.1 million compared to $113.9 million in the third quarter of 2013, an increase of 32.7%. As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses increased to 51.1% of revenue compared to 50.6% in the third quarter of 2013. Included in operating expenses are merchant commissions, processing expenses, bad debt, selling and general administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expense. Included in the third quarter operating expense was approximately $2.6 million of mostly onetime costs related to the Shell Germany start-up, deal-related expenses, severance and other miscellaneous items versus approximately $2.2 million of mostly deal expenses in the third quarter of 2013. 
 There were also $9.9 million of stock compensation expense in the third quarter of 2014 versus $5 million in 2013. Credit losses were $5.8 million for the quarter or 12 basis points compared to $4.9 million or 11 basis points in the third quarter of 2013. The slight increase in bad debt was primarily due to additional bad debt booked in our Russia business due to the slowdown in their economy. Depreciation and amortization increased 42% to $25.7 million in the third quarter of 2014 from $18.1 million in the third quarter of 2013. The increase was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions closed in 2013. 
 We also have a line in our P&L related to our equity method investment, which represents the loss reported on our minority investment in Masternaut for the third quarter. Our loss was driven primarily by additional amortization booked in purchase accounting related to this investment. The Masternaut investment had a slightly positive impact on adjusted net income for the quarter. 
 Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2014 was 30.1% compared to 27% for the third quarter of 2013. The increase in the effective tax rate was due primarily to the decrease in the U.K. rate in the third quarter of 2013 that I discussed earlier.
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $346.5 million in total cash, approximately $42 million of which is restricted and are primarily customer deposits. The company also has a $500 million accounts receivable securitization facility, which was amended on February 3, 2014 to a new maturity date of February 2, 2015. At September 30, we had approximately $394 million borrowed against the facility. We also had $476 million outstanding on our term loan and $478 million drawn on our revolver, leaving $372 million of undrawn availability. 
 As of September 30, 2014, our leverage ratio was 1.62x EBITDA, down from the 1.86x in the second quarter due primarily to the pay down from the free cash flow generated in the business. The 1.62x EBITDA is well below our covenant level of 3.25x EBITDA. We intend to use our free cash flow to temporarily pay down the balance on our revolving credit facility and securitization facility and maintain liquidity for acquisitions and other corporate purposes. 
 Finally, we are not a capital-intensive business, and we spent only $6.7 million on CapEx during the third quarter of 2014. On October 24, the company signed documents to enter into a new $3,335,000,000 credit facility consisting of a Term A loan of $2,020,000,000, a revolving credit facility of $1,035,000,000 and a Term Loan B facility of $300 million. These new bank facilities will be used to refinance our existing Term Loan A and revolving credit facility and help finance the Comdata acquisition. These facilities will close in conjunction with the closing of the acquisition. At the time of closing, the rate on the Term Loan A and revolving credit facility will be LIBOR plus 200 basis points, and the rate on the Term Loan B facility will be LIBOR plus 300 basis points with a floor of 75 basis points.
 Now on to our outlook for 2014. We are increasing our guidance as follows: we expect total revenues to be between $1,100,000,000 and $1,110,000,000, up from our previous guidance range of $1,082,000,000 and $1,097,000,000; adjusted net income to be between $434 million and $440 million, up from our previous guidance range of $432 million and $438 million; adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $5.07 and $5.11, up from our previous guidance range of $5.04 to $5.10. Our adjusted net income per diluted share guidance at the midpoint of the range represents a 25.7% growth rate over the $4.05 per diluted share reported in 2013. 
 Also, to remind everyone, our 2013 results included approximately $5.7 million or $0.07 per diluted share from 2 favorable nonrecurring income tax items. So using a more normalized tax rate in 2013, our growth rate is projected to be approximately 28%. 
 As we enter the fourth quarter, we have headwinds in foreign exchange rates that were not accounting for in the guidance given during our second quarter call. Our guidance for the fourth quarter reflects foreign exchange rates at current levels, which will have an unfavorable impact on our result of approximately $0.05 per share in the fourth quarter versus our previous assumption. As a result, our revised guidance assumes a $1.33 in adjusted net income at the midpoint for the fourth quarter. Without this headwind, we would've guided to around $1.38 for the quarter. 
 Some of the other assumptions that we have made in preparing this guidance include the following: continued weakness in our Russia business, fuel prices at current levels and market spreads slightly better than the year-to-date average as the decrease in the wholesale cost of fuel should result in more favorable fuel spread margins. We expect that the decrease in fuel price will mostly offset more favorable fuel spread margins. We are also assuming fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately 86 million shares and a full year effective tax rate of 30.4%. This tax rate assumption does not include any potential year-end tax adjustments, and as always, no impact related to future acquisitions or material new partnership agreements not already announced. We have also not included any impact related to the closing of the Comdata acquisition in our guidance. As Ron mentioned earlier, we have cleared HSR and have secured the financing for the transaction. As a result, we now believe that we will close the Comdata acquisition around December 1. However, given the significant amount of closing cost we will incur in the acquisition, we believe that the Comdata acquisition will have no impact to our bottom line in the fourth quarter.
 Now I am sure you are all wondering about 2015. While we are not done with our internal budget process, we did want to offer the following observations related to comments previously made about 2015. There are a few unexpected headwinds, primarily foreign exchange rates and fuel prices that we are seeing now, and we expect to continue into 2015. At current levels, these are estimated to negatively impact our bottom line by approximately $0.15 to $0.20 in adjusted net income for the year. However, as we continue to work toward wrapping up the Comdata acquisition, the business is performing better than our expectation, and we are growing more confident around the synergies we can achieve from the combined organizations. In addition, our cost to finance the acquisition is lower than we originally anticipated. As a result, we believe these will net each other out and believe the $6.35 adjusted net income estimate for 2015, we gave you previously in conjunction with the Comdata announcement, is still reasonable. We are planning to talk in more detail about 2015 on our fourth quarter earnings call.
 And with that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Jefferies. 
Ramsey El-Assal: When you do close Comdata, will the percentage of your overall revenues that are exposed to fuel price volatility go up or change in any measurable way? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Ramsey, it's Ron. They'll go down slightly. Comdata is in the kind of 15% affected by fuel price, and I think our number is right around 20%. 
Eric R. Dey: That's correct. So in total, we're about 17% give or take combined. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. And any update on divesting the SVS gift card asset that you'd mentioned previously? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Not yet. We, again, we don't own the company so I'd say we'd done some additional evaluation work and kind of prepping things but not much progress on that. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Is that still something that strategically you're pretty intent on doing? Or could you change your mind on that depending on how the market receives the asset? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. The latter. Again, it's a good business, Ramsey. For us, it's a fit question about, we're good at what we're good at. So if people like it more than we do, then we would unload it, and if not, we'll work with it. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. Last one for me, and I think you may have commented on this earlier, and I just -- I can't quite remember. But the incremental markets you're rolling out with Shell, the costs associated with the rolling out of those markets has largely been expended in developing the platform for Germany. Is that correct? Or are there incremental costs that you'll need to incur to roll the additional countries out? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. They'll be incremental, so our early plan is in the kind of 4 to 5 additional markets next year in '15. And if you think about it, there's separate from the platform, there's conversion. You got to go into the specific market and convert data. There's incremental staffing to handle, those languages, those services and stuff. So I'd say that we've modeled the thing probably at a push. It will probably add $4 million to $5 million of incremental revenue and probably cost us about the same next year. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. And all that's contemplated in the guidance, I'm assuming? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, it is. 
Operator: Our next question comes from David Togut with Evercore. 
David Togut: If I heard correctly, Ron, I thought you said MasterCard volume growth was up 27%. And Eric, you cited 36% revenue growth for the MasterCard product? 
Eric R. Dey: Ron quoted volume and I quoted revenue. So our volume was up 27%, but revenue was up 36%. 
David Togut: So did you put through a significant price increase? Or did you just have higher average ticket in the quarter? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. David, it's Ron. So kind of 2 things. One, I'd say, again, that it's some mix. When we started that product, we started up by selling kind of more in the middle market, where we get lower fees, and we're selling a pile of that. So we're selling more smaller accounts, where we kind of get more fees. So the first one, I think, is mix. And then second, we've added a few transaction fees selectively, so we've done a little bit of rate work as well. 
David Togut: I see. And as a result, is the mid-30s revenue growth rate for this product sustainable? 
Eric R. Dey: I don't have it in front of me, but I'd say probably our model for next year is high-20s, maybe 30% in revenue at constant fuel price. 
David Togut: Got it. And CLC was up mid-20s in the quarter. Anything to call out there in terms of what drove the growth? And is that growth sustainable? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Again, I'd say, as we've commented before, it's really, David, across the board. Our -- that new product that we talked about that's kind of targeted at kind of the middle-sized traveler group is off on a tear. And then our small account, we call it CheckINN Direct, that thing is, again, just -- we're just selling a pile of it. So I'd say the best thing about that business is it's growing the right way, which is demand for it, and we're selling a lot of it. So again, we modeled that thing to be up plus 20% again next year. 
David Togut: Got it. And Ron, you called out the introduction of a new universal card product, the Voyager product. Can you tell us a little bit about that? And how that will be marketed relative to direct MasterCard? 
Ronald F. Clarke: The way we think about this thing, David, it's probably like the banks. So you think about the Chase, the BofA, the Wells Fargo guys, they have a primary network, let's say, MasterCard, but they keep Visa for 10% or 20%. And then they package the products in terms of offers and marketing in certain ways, and they keep both guys because it helps them obviously negotiate. I'd say, that's exactly how we think about it. We think about the product as another very good alternative that fundamentally works the same way as the same universal network. We'll package, market and price it basically the same way, and we've already been doing that. We've got a large number of our sales people selling it. So for us, again, it's good to have that option, that alternative. Again, it mutes interchange risk, pricing risk from MasterCard, so we like having it. And depending on how those couple of guys play with us, we'll move either more volume one way or the other. But customers like it, I'd say, probably about the same as they do the MasterCard product. 
David Togut: Got it. And then just shifting to the U.K. Any update on the rollout of the new AllStar Visa chip card? 
Ronald F. Clarke: That's a great question. It's funny. We literally, last week, went live in what we call our customer pilot, and I'll make up the number, but call it, 100 of our existing accounts went live last week with the product, and I saw some of the email stream, which is good. A few people going, "Wow. Finally, an easy card to use." Because it works like the consumer card. So that thing is officially live and out of the blocks, and we'll start converting large group of accounts probably in Q1. 
David Togut: Understood. And then just shifting over to Comdata cost savings, I think, Eric, you called out expecting more cost savings sooner. Can you ballpark for us what the cost savings as a whole might be for 2015? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes. David, yes, we haven't really quantified that at this time. I mean, as you know, we haven't closed the acquisition yet. And we do believe we'll probably close that transaction before or around December 1. So we'll have obviously a lot more to talk about on the Q4 earnings call, and we can have a discussion about that more then. 
David Togut: Understood. Just a quick final one for me. On the macro for 2015, you called out pressure from FX and lower fuel prices. Do you expect any benefit next year from higher fuel price spreads? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. David, it's Ron. So the answer to that is no, we haven't planned it. As you know, spreads come about due to volatility. You have to -- the fuel prices have to move basically to create spreads going one way or the other. And so the worst situation for us would be low fuel prices just staying low, nothing happening. And what that would cause is we'd lose on the business models that are sensitive to absolute fuel price, and we'd probably run kind of what we call average market spreads, and so it's the volatility price, that's seesawing up and down, that create the spread opportunity. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Smitty Srethapramote with Morgan Stanley. 
Smittipon Srethapramote: Just wondering if you could give us a high-level -- your latest thoughts on telematics now that you've had NexTraq and Masternaut for some time. Can you talk about where you see the opportunity in the space in the U.S. and outside the U.S.? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Smitty, I'd say we're getting a bit smarter. Our original thesis is we like the space, right? Because it nests so close to what we do, and I think we've learned a lot since we acquired the NexTraq business about a year ago, so there's been a lot of learnings about -- as the value in our customer relationships or as the value in our sales relationships. And so for example, on that one, we've learned that the sales and the money we spend and the contacts we make and the window that those people are in, is actually more valuable to help them sell telematics than "cross-selling" to our existing customers. So I guess I'd say that we're still in the evaluation phase of the business in terms of deciding whether we want to play in it in a big way or not. But I would add that we're delighted with the -- this NexTraq company that we bought. The numbers are up. The profits are up, what? 3x. 
Eric R. Dey: Correct. 
Ronald F. Clarke: 3x, I'd say over the quarter a year ago, and the thing is performing well. There's good growth, much better profitability. So I'd say from the one that we own, although it's not very big, we like what we see so far. 
Smittipon Srethapramote: Got it. And maybe you can give us also an update on the Chevron Asia? And where the rollout stands at the moment? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. So the 2 big GFN or processing deals we announced was Caltex in Australia and then 5 or 6 markets for Chevron in Asia. We got a big relationship with Chevron here in North America. And the target date for both of those projects is basically go-live next summer. So we are in the middle of kind of customizing our product to meet the specific requirements of those clients and dialoguing with them. And as we get into the early spring, we'll get into the testing and the training and stuff. So I'd say we're kind of halfway through those projects and are on track to go live next summer. 
Smittipon Srethapramote: Got it. And then the final question from our side is just regarding the increase in confidence on the synergy opportunity in the Comdata. I'm just wondering what you've seen that gives you the increased confidence and then tracking [ph] synergies. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I think the short answer is it's just getting closer, right? So when you're doing diligence with a company and requesting data, we're kind of math guys at FleetCor so we kind of -- we have a bunch of ideas, and we did what we did. But once we signed definitive documents and got -- working closer with their people, we get into, I'll call it, another level of detail, and we've kind of done this before. So I'd say that the ideas we have, the fact base we have, gives us just higher confidence that we can do things and get the money that we planned. 
Smittipon Srethapramote: And can you comment on whether you're getting more confidence in synergies on the revenue side or on the cost side? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I'd say it's both. I mean, the issue for us on the cost side is really going to be timing, so we've obviously identified the low hanging fruit, the things that are clearly overlapping that are easy. But some large amount, I'll say, 1/3 of all Comdata's spending is around the technology area, which is a big number and a much bigger number than at FleetCor. And so the systems planning and the systems integration part of this thing and the vendors around IT are a bigger part of that cost takeout equation. So I'd say the cycle time on that is going to be longer, so we'll take some of the cost money kind of right away, and then I'd say the IT timing is still not certain yet. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. 
James Schneider: I was wondering if you could talk longer term about the deal pipeline that you're seeing right now. I think you mentioned before that you still have other things you're considering actively. So can you maybe talk about the activity levels in terms of negotiations and discussions you might be having? And in terms of what areas? Is it more international? Is it more North America? Is it more traditional fleet or other spaces? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I'd say it's kind of same old, same old here. We've got a big group of people, and again, we know all the people, Jim, and so we've got a pipeline of things that we're working on. And as I look at the list here in front of me, they're mostly in other places outside of the U.S., and it's the same thing. A couple of them are large and a couple of them kind of not so large, so it's -- I'd say it looks like our pipeline kind of looks all the time. We're out there, and we're rattling the bushes and finding stuff. And so that with the financing approach we took leaves us, what, about a half -- $500 million basically of liquidity, Eric? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes, at least. At least. 
Ronald F. Clarke: So we -- our target, Jim, again, is to kind of invest $500 million a year on average, $1.5 billion over the forecast. So we've got money even at the close of this thing to chase these things down in the pipeline. So I'd say we're probably in the same place that we normally are. 
James Schneider: That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up. You mentioned the revenue transaction grew very nicely in the quarter, and I understand that a decent chunk of that is increased fuel price spreads. But can you maybe talk about the contribution you saw from cross-sell telematics or across all of other services into the existing customer base? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I would say there's probably not a lot of that. Again, we're still kind of in the testing mode on the cross-sell. I think it's just, fundamentally, a kind of healthy asset. So in the U.S., the Mastercard thing we quoted the numbers has grown crazy. We brought online. We think we told you a bunch of new partners that finally contributed to revenue that hadn't shown up before. I mentioned the NexTraq thing. We like that's grown high-double digits since we bought it. The CLC thing is rocking. So all the U.S. businesses, it's not really about cross-sell. They're just healthy. Some of the new things we bought like the Epyx business is way up. We put a bunch of programs in that. Our Mexico business is way up. So I think, generally, our Down Under businesses are way up. So I think it's more just the programs that we have in place and the sales that we have in place are just basically working in the businesses, and then we just got a couple of headwinds. Russia is not great because of the environment, and Brazil is not as great with their economy, and the Czech business. So we got 2 or 3 places that are kind of soft mostly because of the environment. But I'd say the rest of them, Jim, are just -- they're just working. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Philip Stiller with Citi. 
Philip Stiller: I guess I wanted to ask about Brazil. You haven't talked too much about it so far. Just an update on how your businesses are performing down there. 
Eric R. Dey: Phil, this is Eric. I would say first, our business there is being impacted somewhat by the economy and the election that was taking place, so I'd say some of our volumes are softer than what we originally anticipated. But what I would say in addition to that is we're still very, very bullish on the prospects of that geography. We've got a bunch of new products that are in the beginning stages of being rolled out. We partnered with a company called Good Card last year, and we're now going to be reselling what is the #1 small to mid-sized fleet card in Brazil. We also partnered with a company called Edenred, and we're going to be cross-selling their food card products as well to our own customer base. We're also in the process of finalizing the rollout of a new national toll tag technology, so that hopefully will be ready to be rolled out as we get into the first quarter next year. So I would say it's a couple of things: one is, the economy is a little bit softer than we had originally anticipated, impacting our volumes; but we're kind of well-positioned as we move forward kind of into the next year and the years beyond with a bunch of new products that we're going to help to grow much bigger business down in that geography over time. 
Philip Stiller: Okay. That's helpful. Could you guys perhaps comment on the partner pipeline both in the U.S. and internationally? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Phil, it's Ron. I'd say we're probably early innings. We've got some conversations going on both here in the U.S. and Canada, and we've got some conversations going on in Europe. But I'd say we're early in a lot of those. I think some of these conversations, particularly the Europe ones have come as a result of the Shell and the Exxon announcements in the last year or 2. So I'd say nothing imminent, but again, I think more of the oil companies are taking notice of this outsourcing idea, and I think frankly, waiting for the kind of news that we're reporting today on the Germany, for example, that we've gone into a country and it's been quiet and it's worked and all that, so -- but more proof that outsourcing is good for these clients, I think, is what the doctor ordered. 
Philip Stiller: Okay. Great. And then last question. I think when you originally gave the preliminary 2015 guidance, you talked about like a 10% organic revenue growth number, and I assume that still holds excluding the impact of the fuel and FX. But just wondering, it seems like you have a lot of good momentum exiting the year. The organic growth was better this quarter. You have some partner deals ramping; you have new products rolling out. I guess how conservative is that 10% number as we look out to next year? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean, the first thing I'd say, Phil, is that it's still early days here at whatever we are. Late October, we actually start what we call pass 2 of budgets next week, so ask me a different day. But I'd say the early view is yes, so in our early passes here, we could reconfirm with you that our global organic target is in constant FX, in constant fuel price, which is how we set the thing up at the 10% or 10% plus. So we feel good about the overall health. And I think one of the questions for us in the budget process is do we want to -- what do we want to do on the expense and the investment side? Do we want to spend more money in IT and more money in sales, particularly behind some of these Europe markets and some of our new cards there and same in Brazil? We like the business we have, okay, but I love the product line that we -- this new product line. So I think one of the big open questions for us communicating with you guys again is: are we going to spend any money? Or are we going to continue to kind of run at these margins? And also there's a wildcard here, obviously, on the FX and the fuel price. This is almost a 30-day phenomenon, right, in terms of what's happened to both of those metrics, so I'd say we're like you. We're watching both of those pretty closely. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that's all the questions we have today. All parties may disconnect. Have a good evening. Thank you.

===== 2014 Q2  (2014-07-31 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings. Welcome to the FleetCor Technologies, Inc. Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Eric Dey, Chief Financial Officer for FleetCor Technology. Thank you, Mr. Dey. You may begin. 
Eric R. Dey: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. By now, everyone should have access to our second quarter press release. It can also be found at www.fleetcor.com under the Investor Relations section.
 Throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and EBITDA. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than other companies' similarly titled non-GAAP information. Quantitative reconciliation of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today's press release and on our website, as previously described. Also, we are providing 2014 guidance on a non-GAAP basis.
 Finally, before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements. This includes forward-looking statements about our 2014 guidance, new products and fee initiatives and expectations regarding business development and acquisitions. They are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore, you should not put undue reliance on them. 
 These results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release in Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Others are discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. These documents are available on our website, as previously described, and at www.sec.gov.
 With that out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Eric, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call today. Upfront here, I'll plan to cover just 2 subjects: first, I'll comment on the quarter and our updated full year outlook; and secondly, I'll provide a bit of an update on some of our major initiatives and our acquisition pipeline.
 Okay. So on to the quarter. Earlier today, we reported Q2 revenue of $274 million, up 24%, and cash EPS of $1.27, up 28%. So 24% top line, 28% bottom line. And this was a bit of a beat against our internal plan. 
 The drivers in the quarter were basically 2 things. One, our biggest businesses continued to perform well: our U.S. direct business, up 9%; our CLC business, up 27%; our U.K. fuel card business, up 19%, so big businesses doing well. Second driver in the quarter was new revenue from our 2013 acquisitions. And again, here, the biggest contributors would be: VB Brazil, which is our transportation card business, Epyx in the U.K.; and NexTraq, our telematics business here in the U.S. So our story is quite somewhat of Q1, strong organic growth from some of our biggest businesses and contributions of new revenue from our 2013 deals. 
 Russia reported results lower than our internal plan, but still 4% ahead of last year in local currency. Russia's sales, that is new business that day onboard, was up 21% versus the prior period. So I'd say that business is hanging in there. 
 The macro environment was generally neutral to slightly negative in the quarter, so it did not help our Q2 results. FX, overall, was generally neutral, the pound quite favorable and the other important currencies to us, unfavorable. The U.S. fuel spreads were soft in the quarter versus the prior year, and we estimate that created probably over $3 million headwind, which is why our U.S. direct business was a shade under 10%. But look, all in all, a very solid quarter.
 Okay. Let me transition over to full year guidance. So at the outset of the year, we provided full year 2014 cash EPS guidance of $4.95 at the midpoint. In May, we raised guidance $0.07 to $5.02 at the midpoint, and today, we're raising guidance again $0.05 to $5.07 at the midpoint. You should think about Q3 and Q4 contributing roughly the same amount in cash EPS. So although our sequential quarterly growth is up, Q4 seasonality offsets it just a bit.
 So we're expecting our second half to be up considerably against the first half. The couple drivers there are: one, the growth that I described in some of our big businesses, along with ramping of some of our new contract wins; and second, more progress on our synergy initiatives in our 2013 deals.
 Okay. Let me transition over now to the status of some of our major initiatives and talk about our M&A pipeline. So first up, Shell Germany. We announced in our May earnings call that we've signed a full outsourcing deal to acquire Shell's SME accounts in Germany, along with a broader framework agreement to acquire portfolios in up to 12 additional European markets. So our progress is quite encouraging here. We're planning to convert the Shell German portfolio in September and launch our web marketing and initial telesales efforts at the same time. So we should be officially up and running in Germany and boarding new business this quarter, so quite exciting to get into the world's #5 biggest market. And once we've proven our performance in Germany, we'll work with Shell to finalize the timing to roll to additional markets. It could be another market or 2 before year end.
 Let me move on to new contract wins. You may recall that we announced a number of new North America partner signings recently. Those included Husky Oil, Quarles, Ultramar and Kwik Trip. And I want to let you know we're making very good progress in bringing those new relationships online. This month, July, we began card conversions for 3 of these, Husky, Quarles, and Ultramar, and now expect these portfolios to be fully ramped by year end. Kwik Trip, which we signed just in June, is scheduled for a conversion in October. So all-around, good progress in getting these relationships online. Our expectation is that these 4 new relationships will contribute in the neighborhood of 5% to 10% in incremental revenue to our North America partner business next year. 
 Next up is Masternaut, which is one of Europe's leading telematics companies. We announced in June our minority investment in Masternaut, alongside Summit Partners. So our focus here is really to evaluate how FleetCor, the mother-ship, how our partner, customer and sales force relationships might accelerate Masternaut's growth profile. And frankly, that assessment is just now getting underway. But the Masternaut transaction does give us a new position in Europe, on top of the position we got here in the U.S. via our NexTraq deal. So good news, we've now got both Europe and U.S. positions to determine if telematics can be a big new global leg for us.
 And finally, let me move to our M&A pipeline. So I would characterize our current M&A pipeline as quite active. As often is the case, we're involved with a number of interesting targets, some of which are now in the late innings. And I'd reiterate that we remain quite confident that we can invest $1.5 billion in deals over the next 3 years.
 So in closing, we're pleased with our Q2 results and, probably, more importantly, our progress to better position the company for continued growth. We continue to execute on our objective of delivering over 20% earnings growth. So again, Q2 grew 28%, and our updated $5.07 guidance would result in 25% earnings growth for the full year.
 Look, our big businesses are still growing well. We're gaining traction from some new client wins and getting those ramped. We broadened our telematics positions to better assess that space, and we're giving chase to some interesting M&A targets, which, of course, we'll announce when appropriate.
 So with that, let me turn the call back over to Eric to provide a bit more color on the quarter. 
Eric R. Dey: Thank you, Ron. For the second quarter of 2014, we reported revenue of $273.5 million, an increase of 24% from the second quarter of 2013. Revenue from our North American segment increased 16% to $138.9 million from $119.5 million in the second quarter of 2013. Revenue from our International segment increased 32.8% to $134.6 million from $101.4 million in the second quarter of 2013. For the second quarter of 2014, GAAP net income increased 21% to $88.5 million or $1.03 per diluted share from $73.1 million or $0.87 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2013. 
 The other financial metrics that we routinely use to measure our business are adjusted revenues and adjusted net income, which we sometimes also refer to as cash net income or cash EPS. Adjusted revenues equal our GAAP revenues less merchant commission. We use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate the company's revenues net of the commissions that are paid to merchants to participate in certain card programs. The reconciliations of adjusted revenues and adjusted net income to our GAAP numbers are provided in Exhibit 1 of our press release. Adjusted revenues in the second quarter of 2014 increased 26% to $253.2 million compared to $201.3 million in the second quarter of 2013. Adjusted net income for the second quarter of 2014 increased 30% to $108.9 million or $1.27 per diluted share compared to $84 million or $1 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2013. 
 For the second quarter of 2014, transaction volumes increased 14% to 90.2 million transactions compared to 79 million transactions in the second quarter of 2013. North America segment transactions grew 4%, driven primarily by organic growth in our U.S. businesses and a telematics transaction we completed in October of 2013. Transaction volumes in our International segment grew 26% and were positively impacted by acquisitions closed in 2013. 
 Adjusted revenue per transaction for the second quarter of 2014 increased 10% to $2.81 from $2.55 in the second quarter of 2013. Revenue per transaction can vary based on the geography, the relevant merchant and customer relationship, the payment product utilized and the types of products or services purchased. The revenue mix is influenced by our acquisitions, organic growth in the business and fluctuations in the macroeconomic environment. When we talk about the macroeconomic environment, we are referring to the impact that market spread margins, fuel prices, foreign exchange rates and the economy in general can have on our business. 
 Revenue per transaction for the second quarter was up in both North America and the International segment. Revenue per transaction was up 12% in North America, due primarily to the positive mix impact of signing up customers, who use higher revenue-per-transaction products than the average, organic revenue growth in many of our higher-margin products, and acquisitions completed in 2013 that have higher revenue-per-transaction products than the average. These positive factors were partially offset by the impact of lower fuel spread margins during the quarter. 
 In the International segment, revenue per transaction increased 6%, due primarily to organic revenue growth in several lines of business, particularly in the U.K. and acquisitions closed in 2013, some of which have products with a higher overall revenue per transaction versus our line average. In addition, foreign exchange rates in the quarter were mixed and, overall, had minimal impact on International revenue per transaction. As previously stated, lower fuel spread margins in the U.S. resulted in an unfavorable impact to revenues in the second quarter. And although we cannot calculate precisely the impact of these changes, we believe it negatively impacted our revenues in the North America segment by approximately $3 million for the quarter. 
 Changes in foreign exchange rates were mixed, and overall, we believe we're neutral during the quarter. Foreign exchange rates were unfavorable in most geographies except the U.K. and New Zealand.
 Now let's shift over and discuss some of the other drivers of our second quarter performance. For our North American segment, most of our lines of business performed well, resulting in a 16% revenue growth rate in the quarter versus prior year. Some of the positive drivers in North America revenue during the quarter were similar to last several quarters, including the exceptional performance of our MasterCard product, which had revenue growth of approximately 34% over the second quarter of 2013, driven primarily by increases in volume. 
 The CLC Group, provider of our lodging and card programs, had another solid quarter with 27% revenue growth over the second quarter of 2013. This revenue growth was driven primarily by increases in our CheckINN Direct product, which target smaller accounts. The second quarter also benefited from our acquisition of NexTraq, a telematics business acquired in October of 2013. 
 Results in our International business were positively impacted by strong organic growth in our U.K. businesses, which posted double-digit revenue growth over last year. Results for our International business were also positively impacted by acquisitions in Brazil and the U.K. in 2013. 
 I am sure a number of you are wondering how our business in Russia has been performing. As of now, the performance of our business in Russia has not changed much since the first quarter and has not appeared to be adversely affected by the sanctions or by changes in regulations by the Russian or U.S. governments. However, we are affected indirectly as the Russian economy is softening, we are experiencing a slowdown in volumes. Our business in Russia is up slightly from prior year in the quarter, excluding the negative impact of the foreign exchange rate. 
 Our International business has also been impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rates and the softening economy in Brazil. FleetCor is a very diversified company geographically, by product and business model. We anticipate the unfavorable economic conditions in Russia will continue for the balance of the year and that foreign exchange rates in Russia will continue at current levels and be unfavorable for the balance of the year as well. However, we expect these negative impacts will mostly be offset by performance of our other businesses for the remainder of 2014. 
 Moving down the income statement. Total operating expenses for the second quarter were $139 million compared to $111.8 million in the second quarter of 2013, an increase of 24%. As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses increased to 50.8% of revenue compared to 50.6% in the second quarter of 2013. Included in operating expenses are merchant commissions, processing expenses, bad debt, selling, and general administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization expense. Including in operating expense for the second quarter of 2014, was $7.7 million of noncash stock compensation expense versus $3.9 million in the first quarter of 2013. Also included in the second quarter, operating expense was approximately $1.8 million of deal-related expenses versus approximately the same amount in the second quarter of 2013. 
 Credit losses were $6.7 million for the quarter or 14 basis points compared to $4.7 million or 10 basis points in the second quarter of 2013. The increase in bad debt was primarily due to additional bad debt booked in our Russia business due to the slowdown in the economy. We expect bad debt to improve in the second half of the year.
 Depreciation and amortization increased 54% to $24.4 million in the second quarter of 2014 from $15.9 million in the second quarter of 2013. The increase was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions closed in 2013. 
 We also have a new line item on our P&L related to our equity method investment, which represents the loss reported on our minority investment in Masternaut for the period of time that we invested in the business in the second quarter. The loss was driven primarily by the additional amortization booked in purchase accounting related to this investment. The Masternaut investment had a slightly positive impact on adjusted net income for the quarter. 
 Our effective tax rate increased slightly to 30.8% compared to 30.6% for the second quarter of 2013. The slight increase in tax rate was due primarily to the mix of earnings from businesses that have higher tax rates. 
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $343.8 million in total cash, approximately $46.2 million of which is restricted and are primarily customer deposits. The company also has a $500 million accounts receivable securitization facility, which was amended in February 3, 2014, to a new maturity date of February 2, 2015. At June 30, we had approximately $424 million borrowed against the facility. We also had $483 million outstanding on our term loan and $555 million drawn on our revolver, leaving $295 million of undrawn availability. 
 As of June 30, our leverage ratio was 1.86x EBITDA, up slightly from the 1.84x in the first quarter, due primarily to the Masternaut investment in the second quarter. The 1.86x EBITDA is well below our covenant level of 3.25x EBITDA. We intend to use our free cash flow to temporarily pay down the balance on our revolving credit facility and securitization facility and maintain liquidity for acquisitions and other corporate purposes. Finally, we are not a capital-intensive business, and we spent only $6 million on CapEx during the second quarter of 2014.
 Now on to our outlook for 2014. We are increasing our guidance as follows: we expect total revenues to be between $1,082,000,000 and $1,097,000,000, up from our previous guidance range of $1,075,000,000 and $1,095,000,000; adjusted net income to be between $432 million and $438 million, up from our previous guidance range of $422 million and $432 million; and adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $5.04 and $5.10, up from our previous guidance range of $4.90 and $5.07. Our adjusted net income per diluted share guidance at the midpoint of the range represents a 25% growth rate over the $4.05 per diluted share reported in 2013. 
 Also, to remind everyone, our 2013 results included approximately $5.7 million or $0.07 per diluted share from 2 favorable nonrecurring income tax items. In the first quarter of 2013 was a reversal of $1.9 million of tax booked in the fourth quarter of 2012 related to the controlled foreign corporation look-through exclusion expiring for FleetCor on December 1, 2012. In the third quarter of 2013, legislation was passed in the U.K. that reduced the statutory income tax rate, which resulted in a $3.8 million reduction in tax expense booked in the third quarter. Without this favorability, our 2014 revised guidance represents a 27% growth rate over 2013.
 Some of the assumptions that we have made in preparing this guidance include the following: continued weakness in our Russia business and unfavorable foreign exchange rates in Russia and Brazil at current levels over the balance of the year; a startup investment related to the Shell build-out of approximately $2 million; fuel prices and market spreads equal to the year-to-date average. We are also assuming fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately 86 million shares and a slight increase in our effective tax rate from 30.5% to 30.7% for the full year of 2014 and, as always, no impact related to future acquisitions or material new partnership agreements. 
 And for those of you that are looking for some guidance on the second half of the year revenue and adjusted net income, I want to remind you that our business has some seasonality in the fourth quarter, and as a result, we expect that our revenue and adjusted net income in the third and the fourth quarters will be approximately the same. 
 And with that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Philip Stiller with Citi. 
Philip Stiller: I guess I wanted to get a bit of a finer point on the guidance. It looks like you raised revenue by about $5 million, but the EPS went up more. And, Ron, you mentioned that you're progressing on the synergies from the acquisitions that were done last year. Is that what's driving the better profit outlook in the back half of the year? 
Eric R. Dey: Phil, this is Eric. Yes, first of all, I mean, the revenue was a -- is a pretty wide range, I mean, just so you know. But from a momentum perspective, I mean, certainly, as we get into the second half of the year, the existing businesses that have performed well are going to continue to perform at a very high level. So we should see a lot of organic growth coming from the same sort of businesses in the second half that we had in the first half. We're also going to start layering in some of the new partner agreements in the second half of the year, so you'll see Husky come on and then some of the other partner wins that Ron mentioned. We'll see some revenue kind of into the fourth quarter. And then finally, some of the synergies, some of -- for some of the acquisitions that we closed last year should also kick in, in the second half of the year as well. So all of that's driving both the revenue and profit. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Phil, Ron. So the short answer is yes. We'll have higher margin on some of the synergy revenue. 
Philip Stiller: Okay. And I guess last couple of quarters, you've been talking about some new products that were in the pipeline, I think the EMV card in the U.K. business and some of the products you're introducing in Brazil. Can you guys provide an update on this? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Still not there, Phil. I'd say we're probably a quarter later on the U.K. chip and pin because of some POS issues. And we're about ready to launch the new fuel card in Brazil, I'd say probably next month. So again, a little bit of a IT delay in both, but I'd say virtually ready to go now in Brazil. 
Philip Stiller: Okay, great. And then I guess last question for me. I mean, you -- it sound like you reiterated the M&A target over the next 3 years. Obviously, there's been some speculation in the market recently. I guess can you talk about your capacity for potentially spending more than that over the next several years? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean, obviously, Eric laid out the leverage ratios, so depending on what we pay or what we buy. I think I've been consistent that we want to kind of run a company that's circa 3x. It's kind of where we are from a management perspective. So I think depending on what we would buy, that would give us significant capacity. 
Philip Stiller: Would you go above 3x for larger acquisition or no? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, yes, we would. But again, I'd say it wouldn't be equilibrium. We might at the close of the deal, but I'd say we wanted to kind of operate the company on an ongoing basis at 3 or below. 
Eric R. Dey: Yes. Phil, let just remind you. Our business generates a lot of cash. So although we could go above the 3, we would pretty quickly delever because of the cash flow profile of the business. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. 
James Schneider: Just one more follow-up on the M&A pipeline, if I could. Can you maybe just talk about the profile deals you're looking at, just in general terms, whether you find the over-the-road segment more attractive than you historically might have been? Or do you think more international deals that might complement your existing deals in Europe might be a little bit more interesting? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Jim, it's Ron. I'd say as long as we have the mix of things that we're looking at, in terms of geography. And in terms of over the road, I'd say that the decision to pilot, to exit the card business probably makes that area look more attractive than it has historically. So you now have a separation of kind of the biggest merchant in the U.S. kind of exiting the card business, which we would like. 
James Schneider: That makes sense and helpful. I guess as a follow-up. Can you maybe just talk -- you gave an update a little bit on the Shell preparations. Can you maybe talk a little bit about whether that is going on plan or maybe even a little bit ahead of plan? And any kind of update on revenue expectations you might expect to realize when that fully ramps? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Again, I'd say we're laughing a little bit as you asked that, because as you know, most IT projects run on the backside of plan. I'd say this one is kind of what you said a bit ahead. In fact, we had to review this week, they're really in final testing. So that's -- so kind of -- with Shell, everything is green, basically, to convert that book of business in September. So I'd say that looks good. And in terms of the projections, really, no different. This is kind of a single-digit millions market, this one market, but in totality, again, I'd say we're still comfortable with kind of the ramp being $20 million to $30 million. 
James Schneider: Great. And just one last clarification. I think you called out VB Servicios and NexTraq as the biggest contributors in the quarter in terms of pipeline of deals you did last year. Can you maybe talk about as we head into the back year -- back half of the year whether you'll see any of the other deals start to contribute more meaningfully? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I think for Phil's question, Jim, that we'll have a lot more acceleration in Q3 and 4 as those 13 deals kind of lap the 1-year mark. So the one you didn't name was Epyx in the U.K. What was that, Eric, an October 1 kind of a close? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes, correct. It's in the fourth quarter. 
Ronald F. Clarke: So I'd say, in every one of those cases, we're expecting revenues to be up pretty significantly from 1 year ago. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Jefferies. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Can you parse out the organic versus inorganic growth separately for the U.S. and international markets? I've been hopping around on calls. You might have spoken to this. I might have missed it but... 
Eric R. Dey: Ramsey, this is Eric. First, let me tell you that first and foremost, I think we're still pretty optimistic that our kind of 10% guidance for the full year is kind of still where we're tracking to, on a full year basis. We're a little lower than that in the second quarter. The U.S. business performed, again, extremely well as we called out a couple of lines of business there. Our MasterCard business grew organically at around 34% in the quarter, and our CLC business grew at 28% organically. So the U.S. business actually did very well, was around 10%. Our International businesses performed a little bit lower than that for the quarter. And then in the back half of the year, again, I would say that we plan our organic growth to accelerate somewhat. The businesses that have performed well in the first half of the year are going to continue to perform well in the second half of the year. Some of the partner wins, again, that we called out are going to be layered on in the second half of the year, particularly as we get into the fourth quarter and we exit into next year. And then finally, some of the acquisitions that we did last year in the second half of the year will start to accelerate some of the organic growth in those businesses in the second half as well. So on a full year basis, I -- we are still looking at around that 10% range. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay, that's helpful. On your telematics segment, you bought NexTraq and then more recently, obviously, you picked up Masternaut in the U.K. I'm trying to understand the degree to which the telematics solutions you now have can kind of scale in different geographies. In other words, is Masternaut more about buying the customer base or distribution capabilities? Or was it technology you were after, where you have to buy a different provider in different geographies? Or is this something that's sort of more once you to test these assets you have, you can kind of independently scale them elsewhere? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Ramsey, it's Ron. The answer is the second. We really bought it for the market position, the feet on the street, the customers, the people. And so it was an asset that was going to trade, and so we took a position in it. So if we conclude that we like this space, we're set to go in the 2 big geographies. That was the basis. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. One last one. And not to beat the dead horse on this, it's Comdata. There's chatter about Comdata. But my sort of broader strategic question is, Comdata has a lot more business lines than just fleet services. I've always kind of considered you guys as being pretty focused on fleet or transport-related solutions. I mean, has your thinking changed, just in general, on getting into unrelated business lines, like virtual cards or health care merchant processing? Or should we think about your M&A activities being kind of just as focused on fleet as before? Or are you kind of thinking about getting into other unrelated areas? Maybe that's independent of Comdata? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, a couple of comments. So, one is a quarter of our estimated revenue for the full year is beyond fuel cards. It's "not fuel cards." So I'd say we already have some diversity. Two, we're not going to do anything unrelated. But payments for us, what we call workforce payments, we view as related as long as the model, Ramsey, looks the same to us. So we will have more nonfuel card in our revenue mix as we go forward for sure. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Right. But I was taking about it's not just -- it's not fuel card, but it seems like your product still kind of revolve around that kind of transport solutions, whether it's lodging, whether it's the different payment products you have. Would you contemplate just getting into a completely separate business line that had nothing to do with servicing that transport sector, like health care or something like that? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Again, we don't really look at it that way, right? We look at the end client being a business is kind of cut one; and then the second one is we look at the model that's basically used, is it IT-centric, the revenue model, the recurring nature of the business. So I'd say we're not -- we don't really define the business around, hey, it's got to have some "transport piece." It's basically got to be B2B payments, and it's got to be a model that we get. 
Operator: Our next question comes from David Togut with Evercore. 
David Togut: Your 2 biggest drivers of organic growth in North America, direct MasterCard and CLC, showed pretty strong acceleration over the growth we saw in the first quarter. Can you talk about what drove that acceleration in Q2? And how should we think about growth in both of those products for the back half of this year? 
Ronald F. Clarke: David, it's Ron. So the -- I'd say the good news in both cases is sales. So the 34% number in MasterCard and the 27 in CLC were virtually 90%-plus volume-driven. And if you look at the reason, it was basically sales. We're just selling the you-know-what out of both of those product lines and, as we've said before, in CLC, particularly the down market of the small business market. And so the sales in both of those, which were not recorded in the quarter, but billed, as you know, are both above plan and going great. So I would say our outlook in the next couple of quarters is big, similar to what you're seeing. 
David Togut: Just as a quick, quick follow-up, you've talked before about rolling out the 12 other markets in Europe with Shell after you complete Germany and then potentially introducing the food card and telematics products. Has your thinking on those new products at all changed? And I guess, what might be the timeline for those? 
Ronald F. Clarke: No. I'd say it's unchanged. I'd say that this is iceberg work, David. So much of the work is below the waterline, right, to kind of get there, get some big accounts, to trust, build the systems that we need. And so having this mega template effectively going live in a month or so, I can't stress again how big a deal that is for the company, getting on to the continent there with a meaningful piece of business. And so we're going to digest that. And assuming that goes well, we'll pick up the pace on other markets there on the continent. And then obviously, post having those positions, we'll start the layering of the other things. So I think we're getting closer to actually now realizing a vision that we've had for quite a while. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Darrin Peller with Barclays. 
Darrin Peller: Look, I just want to start off with the comments I think you made around exiting the year. With respect to layering on revenue, the organic growth rate was, I guess, a tad below the 10% this quarter. I think it was a little higher than that last quarter. And then second half, you -- again, you see things rolling on. First of all, the trends underlying that, I mean, like -- I think David just brought up. I mean, you have MasterCard growth at 30-plus-percent CLC growth, that's clearly higher than last quarter. I mean, if those trends continue and you're layering on, shouldn't the exit run rate be pretty indicative of sort of a stronger organic growth rate next year? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I would say, Darrin, that that's probably not far off. I'd say internally, our outlook is above 10% organic in both Q3 and Q4. And it's what you said, it's the businesses that have performed, it's this onboarding of a series of new accounts that won't be a lot in the quarters, but will be as we exit. And then, again, it's the lapping of the 13 deals that are way up. And so I'd say our confidence in the next 2 quarters is high. And to your point, that'll feed into '15. So I'd say we're pretty bullish on the forward organic look. 
Darrin Peller: All right, that's great. Just specifically on the deals now. If you can give us a little more color on what are the specific ones we expect the most synergies from over the course -- that you haven't really recognized yet, over the course of the next, let's call it, 4 to -- 3 or 4 quarters, if you don't mind. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Again, it's -- we don't do a deal where they're not significant. But again, you got to measure it against the size of the deal. So again, the big deals would be that VB deal, the NexTraq deal and the Epyx deal would be the 3 biggest from last year. And so we're literally just -- what were they? It's all kind of third quarter. Eric? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes, all in the second half. 
Ronald F. Clarke: So, Darrin, we're just getting kind of now to the place where our programs is in and we're starting to get some of those dollars. So those are kind of fourth, fifth inning in terms of where they're going. And then even some of the smaller deals like Australia and New Zealand that we're just kind of lapping now, those would be up a lot but they're just smaller, right? In terms of absolute dollars. So again, I think the good news for those of you that care about our future M&A, I'd say that our 13 vintage of deals that our execution has been good and our outlook for that set of deals is good. So I can't always say that our '14 and '15 vintage will be good, but our record on those, I think, is pretty good. 
Darrin Peller: All right. I mean, I guess just last question and then I'll turn it back to the queue. And the partnerships you guys have done. Obviously, Chevron was announced last quarter and Shell's the acquisition -- we haven't really heard -- I mean, there's been a lot of acquisitions. But I mean, what other types of -- are there any other real partnerships like that on the -- in the pipeline that we've seen and talked about in the past? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Again, I think we've announced not only a couple of those larger ones you mentioned, but the Shell, 12 markets, the Caltex, the Chevron kind of some of the big names that we've named, another kind of 4 or 5, what we would call, kind of midsized or regional North American deals. I'd say we're kind of full up, Darrin, digesting, what is it, 5, 6, 7 of these things that -- literally that almost no revenue so far that are going to be coming online. So I'd say in terms of the other ones, who are more early days, we want to do a good job on these, particularly the Shell one and the Caltex and Chevron, so that the other oil see us as a good performer. So I'd say the company's pretty focused on getting these things online. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Smitti Srethapramote with Morgan Stanley. 
Smittipon Srethapramote: So just a follow-up question on the CheckINN product. It's been around a couple of years. Just wondering what's been the key driver to sort of ignite the adoption of this product over the past couple of quarters? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I think it's really just sales execution. Again, this product -- we kid, Smitti, inside the company that it's probably the single-highest value product in the marketplace, where a small company that travels around regionally can go into these kind of economy and mid-scale hotels at 15%, 20% off the street price. And it's a pretty simple product. And so once you make that proposition to Ron's tree-cutting company, that he can say 20% at the Holiday Inn, they like the product. And so the key has been sales and distribution and marketing and making sure people know that we got the product. And so the guy that's running that has built a bigger, broader sales organization in the last year-plus. And we're actually funding an expansion of that here in the next couple of quarters. So I'd say it's really just scaling up of our sales behind, really, just a terrific product. 
Smittipon Srethapramote: Got it. And then just wanted to get your thoughts on the prepaid fuel card market. One of your competitors announced a deal with Shell a couple of weeks ago. Just wondering, do you see that as another opportunity? And that's something that would be a new growth driver for you guys? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. The market that seems to have some interest in that product is Asia. Obviously, we didn't chase it because we didn't think it was kind of a midterm opportunity. So we took some different priorities with our "GFN" product. So I'd say that our view of that is pretty low potential over the short term. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Let me ask -- I think, Ron, you said that there's a bit of a beat versus internal expectation this quarter. I heard the big business are doing well. But maybe you can just specify, what was better than planned? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Tien-tsin. It was really, I'd say, almost across-the-board. I'd say the one place that was not better was our direct business because of the spreads. I think I called out kind of a $3 million headwind to that thing. That's around 9% instead of low double digits. But basically, it was -- we did better, frankly, in Russia than we thought. That was up 4% in local currency. We thought that thing was going to go south. The telematics business was up. The U.K. business is doing terrific. Our Mexico business sold twice as much than it had in the prior year. So I'd say it was pretty healthy in a lot of places, and it was just -- we, basically, are just selling better in a lot of places. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: How does the fuel spread situation look like quarter-to-date here, almost into August? I know the fuel has been pretty volatile. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I'd say it's kind of back on normal again. We -- because of you, guys, we keep track of this thing quarterly, but we really look at it over annual cycles. And I think I've mention, we track it for 10 years, and it's a pretty steady number that allows all these retailers to stay in business, right? To some minimum return they need to run these locations. And so spreads have to respond at some point where they can make some money. And so again, it bumps around based on a bunch of factors. But work -- to Eric's point, we're outlooking, Tien-tsin, kind of history on the go forward, which -- who knows? But that's what we're outlooking. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Got it, understood. And then just the $2 million tied to the Shell build-out on the investment, what's the trigger for that incremental spend there? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. So we spent some of it. Some of it's what I'll call getting ready. So we spent incremental IT money in terms of customizing stuff, doing data conversion work. We've hired some additional management. I hired a new guy, basically, to run the German market. He's an ex-GE guy who's great, but unfortunately, expensive. And now we're kind of heading into operating times. So we've got people, sales, web investment, service investment. Obviously, if we do the conversions we plan, we'll have some revenue offset. But I'd say we're trying to get ahead, basically, of that thing, particularly from a sales and marketing perspective, so we can show Shell that we know how to sell their product and make them interested and keep going with us. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: I see, I see. Last question. Just on the -- I've spent some time with the -- with Edenred. And I guess there's a lot of activity going on in Brazil, and also, it sounds like Mexico could have some favorable regulations potentially. So I'm curious M&A-wise, could we see you sort of point back into those 2 areas? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, we obviously are on the ground in both of those markets, have good relationships, Tien-tsin, with everybody in this space. So if there's a deal that'll trade, we'll certainly be looking at it. That -- the regulation you mentioned, which we thought was going to be a negative in Mexico. I don't know if we did call this out. But if you remember, they basically -- the government passed a law to basically eliminate the tax deduction on the paper on the voucher side of food. And so obviously, lots of clients are trying to move over to card. And so I'd say we got our better-than-line-average share of that, and it's caused people to kind of look up. So we've -- as I mentioned, we've sold twice as much in that business of new business than we had in the prior period. So it looked like it was going to be a problem, and I'd say it's actually turned out to be a positive. 
Operator: Thank you for participating in today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a great day.

===== 2014 Q1  (2014-05-01 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the FleetCor Technologies, Incorporated First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. 
 [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Eric Dey, Chief Financial Officer for FleetCor Technologies. Thank you, Mr. Dey. You may begin. 
Eric R. Dey: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. By now, everyone should have access to our first quarter press release. It can also be found at www.fleetcor.com, under the Investor Relations section.
 Throughout this conference call, we'll be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and EBITDA. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than other companies’ similarly titled non-GAAP Information. Quantitative reconciliation of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today's press release and on our website as previously described.  Also, we are providing 2014 guidance on a non-GAAP basis.
 Finally, before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements. This includes forward-looking statements about our 2014 guidance, new products and fee initiatives, and potential business development and acquisitions. They are not guarantees of future performance and therefore, you should not put undue reliance on them. These results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release and Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Others are discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. These documents are available on our website as previously described and at www.sec.gov. With that out of the way, I would like to turn the  call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay, Eric. Thanks. Again, good afternoon, everyone. And as always, I appreciate you joining today. So upfront here, I'm going to plan the cover just 2 subjects. So first off, I'll comment on the quarter and our full year outlook. And secondly, I'll comment on today's Shell Europe and Chevron announcements. 
 Okay. So on to the quarter. So Q1 results were very good. We reported revenue of $254 million, that's up 31% and cash EPS of $1.12. That's up 25%. So 31% top line, 25% bottom line.
 The growth in the quarter was really driven by 2 things. First off, our biggest businesses performed quite well. Our North America fuel card business grew revenue 11%. Our U.K. fuel card business grew revenue 19%, and our CLC business grew revenue 16%. So really, strong organic growth performance from 3 of our biggest business.
 Second driver for the quarter was the new revenue from our 2013 acquisitions. So the most significant contributions would have been from VB Brazil, Epyx in the U.K. and NexTraq here in the U.S. So growth from big business performance and contributions from our new deals. We also had a few headwinds in Q1. So first, the environment. I'd characterize the environment's impact on our numbers as slightly negative, probably in the range of a few million negative.
 Second, as you probably expect, our Russia business performance was not great in the quarter, particularly among our major oil partners there whose businesses and volumes were kind of noticeably off in the quarter. Compounded with the ruble, which was also quite unfavorable in the quarter.
 Lastly, we had an unfavorable tax compare this quarter. Our effective rate, 30.5% this quarter versus 28.6% last Q1. So that obviously depressed our earnings growth rate a couple of points. Eric will follow-up on this a bit more.
 But look. In summary, despite the few headwinds I just cited, we're off to a very good start and very pleased with these results. So let me transition to full year guidance.
 So today, we're raising 2014 cash EPS guidance $0.07 to $5.02 at the midpoint. That reflects our Q1 bead. We remain conservative really on the rest-of-year outlook.
 So even though we're running ahead of our expectation, we do see a few headwinds looming for the balance of the year. So first off, Russia. We expect that will likely remain soft and behind plan. Second, Latin America FX will likely remain unfavorable. And lastly, we do plan to make some startup investments to launch our Shell Germany initiative. So if you take all these together, I'd say we're still very confident in the full year cash EPS number that's above $5. So a good quarter and a positive outlook for the full year.
 Okay. Let me transition now over to the Shell announcement we made a bit earlier today. So first off, this is very exciting news for us. We've been at it quite a long time trying to secure a meaningful full outsourcing deal in Europe that could serve as a  launching pad for us. And now, we have it. So let me just run through the deal -- the benefits of the deal and provide you some rough sizing for 2014 and beyond.
 So we signed definitive documents to acquire Shell's private label card business of smaller clients in Germany in what we term a full outsourcing deal. In addition, we signed a broader framework agreement that would enable us to acquire Shell's portfolios in an additional 12 European markets, including sizable geographies like France, Poland and the Netherlands. So a big opportunity.
 In terms of benefits, I'd characterize them as primarily market-entry related. These are big European markets and historically have been very difficult for us to gain access to.
 So now, we'll enter Germany, which we've targeted for some time, the #5 market in the world, and have a full FleetCor base of operations to build out our product line and market reach over time. And then obviously, the opportunity to expand into France, Poland and the Netherlands, in particular, quite interesting. In terms of financial sizing, we're expecting the Shell Germany conversion launch kind of late this summer, August, September, expecting a contribution of a few million in revenue this calendar year, but that will be more than offset by our startup investments to get the project going. 
 Over time, as Germany and the other 12 markets are rolled out, we expect this deal could contribute in the range of $20 million to $30 million of annualized revenue.
 So look, this is an important milestone with Shell. Their decision to select us for this important assignment could lead to more work over time with them, potentially in other geographies or in other customer segments. The announcement today may also serve as a catalyst to other European major oils who view this as further proof that Fleet has the systems, the operational presence and most importantly, the know-how to help them manage their fuel card portfolios. So all in all, quite an important development for us.
 We also announced after the close that we signed a long-term fuel card processing contract with Chevron International. That covers 6 Asia Pac markets and South Africa. So it's exciting for us to broaden our global relationship with Chevron and also extend the number of clients that we have running on GFN. So, really good news there. 
 So in closing, we continue to execute on our plan to build, buy and partner and target earnings growth north of 20% annually. So Q1, we beat our January guidance and grew earnings over 20%. We announced this partnership deal with Shell, giving us access to a number of major European markets, as well as broadening our global Chevron relationships. And in total, over the last 12 months, we've signed 8 new partner deal, 8, and closed 7 acquisitions. So we're staying quite busy on the business development front.
 So with that, let me turn the call back over to Eric so that he can provide some additional information on the quarter and the rest-of-year outlook. Eric? 
Eric R. Dey: Thank you, Ron. For the first quarter of 2014, we reported revenue of $253.9 million, an increase of 31% from the first quarter of 2013. Revenue from our North American segment increased 25.6% to $126.4 million from $100.6 million in the first quarter of 2013. Revenue from our International segment increased 37% to $127.5 million from $93.1 million in the first quarter of 2013. For the first quarter of 2014, GAAP net income increased 16% to $75.1 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, from $64.7 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2013. The other financial metrics that we routinely use to measure our business are adjusted revenues and adjusted net income, which we sometimes also refer to as cash net income or cash EPS. Adjusted revenues equal our GAAP revenues less merchant commission. We use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate the company's revenues net of the commissions that are paid to merchants who participate in certain card programs. The reconciliations of adjusted revenues and adjusted net income to our GAAP numbers are provided in Exhibit 1 of our press release. 
 Adjusted revenues in the first quarter of 2014 increased 31% to $236.3 million compared to $179.8 million in the first quarter of 2013. Adjusted net income for the first quarter of 2014 increased 28% to $96.1 million, or $1.12 per diluted share, compared to $75.2 million, or $0.90 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2013. 
 For the first quarter of 2014, transaction volumes increased 18.1% to 87.6 million transactions compared to 74.2 million transactions in the first quarter of 2013. North American segment transactions were 5.7%, driven primarily by organic growth in our U.S. businesses and the Telematics transactions we completed in April and October of 2013. Transaction volumes in our International segment grew 31.5% and were positively impacted by acquisitions closed in 2013. Adjusted revenue per transaction for the first quarter of 2014 increased 11.2% to $2.70 from $2.42 in the first quarter of 2013. Revenue per transaction can vary based on geography, the relevant merchant and customer relationship, the payment product utilized and the types of products or services purchased. The revenue mix is influenced by our acquisitions, organic growth in the business and fluctuations in the macroeconomic environment. When we talk about the macroeconomic environment, we are referring to the impact that market spread margins, fuel prices, foreign exchange rates and the economy in general can have on our business.
 During the first quarter, lower fuel spread margins and lower fuel prices, primarily in the U.S., resulted in unfavorable impact to revenues. And although we cannot calculate precisely the impact of these changes, we believe it negatively impacted our revenues by approximately $2 million to $3 million for the quarter. Changes in foreign exchange rates were mixed and overall, we believe negatively impacted our revenues by approximately $2 million during the quarter. Foreign exchange rates for Brazil and Russia were unfavorable for the quarter but were partially offset by favorable exchange rates in the U.K. pound sterling.
 Revenue per transaction for the first quarter was up in both North America and the International segment. Revenue per transaction was up 18.9% in North America, due primarily to the positive mix impact of signing up customers who use higher revenue per transaction products than the average, organic revenue growth in many of our higher-margin products and acquisitions completed in 2013 that have higher revenue per transaction products than the average. These positive factors were partially offset by the impact of lower fuel prices and fuel spread margins during the quarter.
 In the International segment, revenue per transaction increased 4.2% due primarily to organic revenue growth in several lines of business, particularly in the U.K. and acquisitions closed in 2013. Some of which have products with a higher overall revenue per transaction versus our line average. Partially offsetting was the unfavorable foreign exchange rates in the quarter.
 Now let's shift over and discuss some of the other drivers of our first quarter performance. First, in our North American segment. Most of our lines of business performed well, resulting in a 25.6% revenue growth rate in the quarter versus prior year. Some of the positive drivers in North America revenue during the quarter were similar to last year, including the exceptional performance of our MasterCard product, which had revenue growth of approximately 29% over the first quarter of 2013, driven primarily by increases in volume. The CLC Group, provider of our lodging and card programs, had another solid quarter with 16% revenue growth over the first quarter of 2013. This revenue growth was driven primarily by increases in our check-in direct product, which targets smaller accounts. The first quarter also benefited from strong performance of our partner business and the positive impact of the Telematics acquisitions closed in April and October of 2013.
 Results in our International business were positively impacted by strong organic growth in our U.K. businesses, which posted double-digit revenue growth over last year. Results for International businesses were also positively impacted by acquisitions in Brazil, the U.K. and Russia, that closed in 2013. I'm sure a number of you are wondering how our business in Russia has been impacted by recently announced regulatory changes and U.S. sanctions. As of now, our business in Russia does not appear to be adversely affected by any changes in regulations by the Russian or U.S. governments, nor do we do business with any persons or entities that have been sanctioned. However, we are affected indirectly as Russian economy is softening, and we are experiencing a slowdown in volumes. Our International business has also been impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rates in Russia, as well as Brazil. 
 FleetCor is a very diversified company geographically, by product and by business model. We anticipate the unfavorable economic conditions in Russia will continue for the balance of the year and that foreign exchange rates in Russia and Brazil will continue at current levels and also be unfavorable for the balance of the year. However, we expect these negative impacts will be offset by our other businesses, which are off to a strong start in 2014.
 Now moving down the income statement. Total operating expenses for the first quarter were $139.8 million compared to $99.4 million in the first quarter of 2013, an increase of 40.6%. As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses increased to 55.1% of revenue compared to 51.3% in the first quarter of 2013. Included in operating expenses are merchant commissions, processing expenses, bad debt, selling and general administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expense. Included in operating expense for the first quarter of 2014 was $10.6 million of non-cash stock compensation expense versus $4.2 million in the first quarter of 2013. The increase was due to new share grants issued.
 Also included in 2014 operating expenses is approximately $2 million of deal-related expenses versus approximately $1 million in the first quarter of 2013. Credit losses were $5.6 million for the quarter, or 11 basis points, compared to $4.5 million, or 9 basis points, in the first quarter of 2013. Our bad debt now has stabilized around the 10, 11-basis-point range. 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 67% to $24.4 million in the first quarter of 2014 from $14.6 million in the first quarter of 2013. The increase was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions closed in 2013. Total interest expense increased 58% to $5.5 million in the first quarter of 2014 from $3.4 million in the first quarter of 2013. The increase was primarily due to additional borrowing for acquisitions closed in 2013 and a slight increase in the interest rate on our term loan due to an increase in our leverage ratio in the first quarter. Our effective tax rate increased to 30.5% compared to 28.6% for the first quarter of 2013. If you recall, in the first quarter of 2013, there was a reversal of $1.9 million of tax booked in the fourth quarter of 2012 related to the controlled foreign corporation and look-through exclusion expiring for FleetCor on December 1, 2012. Excluding the impact of this one-time tax reversal, our tax rate in the first quarter of 2013 would have been approximately 30.6%.
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $330.2 million in total cash, approximately $46.8 million of which is restricted and are primarily customer deposits. The company also has a $500 million accounts receivable securitization facility, which was amended on February 3, 2014, to a new maturity date of February 2, 2015. At March 31, we had approximately $394 million borrowed against the facility. We also had $490 million outstanding on our term loan and $499 million drawn on our revolver, leaving $351 million of undrawn availability. As of March 31, our leverage ratio was 1.84x EBITDA, well below our covenant level of 3.25x EBITDA. We intend to use our free cash flow to temporarily pay down the balance on our revolving credit facility and securitization facility and maintain liquidity for acquisitions and other corporate purposes. 
 Finally, we are not a capital-intensive business, and we spent only $5.6 million on CapEx during the first quarter of 2014.
 Now onto our outlook for 2014. We expect: total revenues to be between $1.75 billion and $1.95 billion, up from our previous guidance range of $1.70 billion and $1.90 billion; adjusted net income to be between $422 million and $432 million, up from our previous guidance range of $418 million and $428 million; and adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $4.97 and $5.07, up from our previous guidance range of $4.90 and $5. Our adjusted net income per diluted share guidance at the midpoint of the range represents a 24% growth rate over the $4.05 per diluted share reported in 2013. Also, to remind everyone, our 2013 results included approximately $5.7 million, or $0.07 per diluted share of favorable non-recurring income tax items, and the first quarter was a $1.9 million benefit that I previously described. 
 In the third quarter of 2013, legislation was passed in the U.K. that reduced the statutory income tax rate, which resulted in a $3.8 million reduction in tax expense booked into the third quarter. Without this favorability, our 2014 revised guidance represents a 26% growth rate over 2013. Some of the assumptions that we have made in preparing this guidance include the following: continued weakness in our Russian business and unfavorable foreign exchange rates in Russia and Brazil at current levels over the balance of the year; a startup investment related to Shell build-out of approximately $2 million; fuel prices equal to 2013 average; market spreads equal to the 2013 average. We are also assuming fully diluted shares outstanding of 86 million shares, a slight increase from our prior guidance of 85.6 million shares. Also, a 1% increase in our effective tax rate from 29.5% in 2013 to 30.5% in 2014. And as always, no impact related to future acquisitions or material new partnership agreements.
 In summary, we are off to a very good start to 2014 in spite of the headwinds that we have discussed. Our guidance reflects our continued confidence in the ability of our business to grow and execute while, at the same time, recognizing that there are macroeconomic conditions that will continue to challenge us.
 And with that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ramsey El-Assal from Jefferies. 
Ramsey El-Assal: In terms of the Shell deal and the broader framework sort of for additional regional portfolios you mentioned, what's the timing of the broader rollout? Are there additional sign-offs required? Or is it just a matter of sort of scheduling? Does Germany have to perform well for the other markets to open up? Or is it just kind of they're just going to roll out as they come? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I think, Ramsey -- It's Ron. It's really an IT planning issue, and basically both us and Shell's ability to absorb the IT work. So we'll probably have a clearer answer when we get to the summer. But I would guess, probably a couple more markets later this year and then the balance in '15. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Is there anything -- is there any reason why they held back the broader commercial portfolio and are starting with just the small business? Is it sort of a test of sorts? Or is it just -- are there any other factors to consider there? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean, I think they hold obviously their larger account relationships closer, a; and b, I think they view us as specialists in the small market. So I think those are a couple of reasons they started us here. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. One last one from me. Just to be clear, the payments regulation that recently moved through the Duma in Russia, mandating the in-country processing, it sounded like that just does not include your business. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Again, we're not probably the right legal guys. But I'd say, our interpretation is that we would be not impacted by the law -- the way that we operate there. We would not fall under those regs. 
Ramsey El-Assal: You already have a data center in Russia right? 
Ronald F. Clarke: We do. We actually process and settle locally. And again, more than half the business that we have there is basically supporting major oils and other issuers, really as kind of a software and network provider. We're not even really in the issuing side of the business. So I think for both -- all 3 perspectives, kind of legally, what we do, I don't think we'd classify as a co-payment system. Two, we basically process and settle locally. And then 3, a big part of our business is really supporting issuers. 
Operator: Next question is from Tien-tsin Huang, JPMorgan Chase. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Just a follow-up on Ramsey's question on the Shell piece. So the $20 million, $30 million I'm assuming is post rolling out all of the different countries? And then would you also have country-specific set up costs to stand those businesses up post acquisitions of those countries? Did you follow my question? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes and yes, Tien-tsin, are the short answers. So yes, that -- the $20 million to $30 million as we basically put all those markets online. Although as you can imagine, there's concentration. So some of the larger markets would obviously represent a much larger piece of that thing. And then b, yes, there will be some startup cost but they'll be less because we'll be kind of replicating the model basically that we're using in Germany. So still cost, but lower than the startup one. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Okay. Good to know. And then I guess just to ask also a regulatory question as it relates to Europe. We were getting some questions today about all the stuff in Europe, PSD2 et cetera. What's your current understanding? I know the rules are still getting debated and it's not yet law in parliament, but where do you think we are with how commercial cards will be treated in the interchange cap discussion in Europe? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I'd say, Tien-tsin, we're on the same place you are, which is we don't know. We've heard, probably like you have, that they're still pushing that to be a carve out -- because consumers are obviously the higher target. But we don't know. Again, the good news, as you know, is all of our deals there are fundamentally proprietary. It wouldn't be swept into that legislation, although clearly it wouldn't be helpful to us if there's pressure across kind of general-purpose cards. That would not be helpful long term. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Yes. Agreed. Agreed. I figured I'd ask since you're closer to it than we are. And then just maybe a housekeeping for Eric, just the organic growth in the quarter. Did you provide that? 
Eric R. Dey: Tien-tsin, this is Eric. I would say the organic growth in the first quarter was in line with our prior guidance. So it's -- I would say just around the 10% or just under the 10% range. 
Operator: Next question from Glenn Fodor, Autonomous. 
Glenn Fodor: Just on the SG&A, Eric. Just to be clear, last quarter, I believe you said stock comp would be $27 million for the year and more evenly distributed, I think, throughout the quarter. So we're starting this year at around $10 million and just a slight drop-off from the fourth quarter's abnormal level because there was -- gets a  true-up there. How should we be thinking about this $27 million for the year? Is that still in place and just take this down evenly for the next 3 quarters? Is that a fair way to forecast? 
Eric R. Dey: The numbers actually are going to drop after this quarter. So it gets into more of the $6 million to $7 million range within the last 3 quarters of the year. However -- I mean, we do still have some plans to issue some new stock grants in the second quarter. So again, if those numbers change any material way, we'll let you know. But effectively, they are going to step down a little bit starting in Q2. Again, just assume around $7 million. 
Glenn Fodor: And then can you -- I don't know if you did quantify this, but the FX impact for the year as it relates to guidance -- I mean, did you put a number on that? Or can you help -- give us some parameters? I know what you said about the currency rates and your assumptions, but how does it translate to the dollars on revenues? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes. In the first quarter, we were unfavorably impacted by FX to the tune of about $2 million. So clearly, that trend -- I mean, we're anticipating that to continue over the balance of the year. So I would take that number obviously times 4, and you'll probably get into the ballpark, and then maybe a little higher as we step into the higher volume months. So probably closer to $10 million or so. 
Glenn Fodor: Okay. And then a last question for Ron. Ron, with respect to 2013's acquisitions, how would you -- I know cross-selling is a big part of your model there, and it's been fruitful in the past. But are these assets and the sales force training, is that all in place such that the cross-selling is happening? And can you share any sort of successes with us or contributions to revenue from, again, perhaps cross-selling the products that you have access to now in 2013 and pushing it across the rest of your portfolio? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Glenn. It's a good question. I'd say, again, it's pretty early. Right? Most of that stuff we closed in the fall. So I'd say we're underway, point 1. Point 2 is every one of those deals had a thesis for more revenue and more profits this year, and I'd say -- report that we're on plan for the deals internally for Q1. And b, as part of our internal forecasting, I'd say we're still anticipating the 2013 deals to be "on plan" for the balance of the year. So I'd say early. But so far, so good. 
Operator: Next question, Darrin Peller of Barclays. 
Darrin Peller: Let me just start off on the front around the headwinds in Russia. Just a little more color, if you can give us, on what you'd expect that to actually impact the business by? I mean, I know you mentioned it in the context of a few. And you can maybe frame that around with regard to the revenue guidance range. Obviously, you had a very good quarter. How much of the Russia trends you're seeing is actually holding you back on that front? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Darrin, it's Ron. Let me start. So first off, again, just to create some context, so Russia is kind of circa 5% of FleetCor, kind of point 1. Point 2, although I called out that it was behind plan, which it was for Q1 and it's going to be behind our plan for rest of year, call it in the maybe $7 million to $10 million range miss from our plan. The good news is it's still growing. So for the first quarter in local currency, that business was still ahead top and bottom, and we're still forecasting the thing to be ahead top and bottom. So I want to make sure that it's clear that, a, it's not large; and b, it's far in our minds from "some kind of a meltdown." It's just a reverse in being a high-growth big opportunity for us this year, which is what we had planned. And then you pile on the ruble, which is down, what, Eric? 12% or something? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes. That's correct. 
Ronald F. Clarke: So when you compound, Darrin, the FX, those are the 2 things that kind of depress us vis-a-vis the plan. 
Darrin Peller: All right. That's helpful. Maybe just one more question on the organic side. You mentioned the company is still growing just under, I think, 10% for the whole business. Is there a way you can maybe just parse out the international organic trends in terms of -- maybe frame it versus the company-wide organic growth? Obviously, North America looks very strong, but then we see 30-plus percent transaction growth internationally and revenue per transaction up, although obviously a lot of deal-related acquired revenue there. So a little more context would be great. 
Eric R. Dey: Yes. Hey, Darrin, this is Eric. Again, I would say, first, on a consolidated basis, it's running kind of in the high single digits, just kind of under 10%. And as you would imagine, those numbers vary by geography. The United States had a very, very strong first quarter. We were growing, I would say, in the low to mid-single digits from an organic growth perspective. And then when you look at rest of world, it was growing more in the mid kind of single-digit range with some of the headwinds that we experienced around the world. 
Operator: Next question from Smitti Srethapramote, Morgan Stanley. 
Smittipon Srethapramote: A couple of questions on the recently announced deals. So on the Shell deal, can you help us think about the potential lift to revenue per transaction as you transition from only transaction processing to more of a full outsourcing-type situation in the German portfolio? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Smitti. It's Ron. I'd say you guys should think about that as kind of around line average. It'll probably start a smidge below and then kind of grow to line average to a bit above. And the reason is it takes us a little bit of time to kind of put the FleetCor playbook in. But again, it's -- from day one, since we're acquiring the book and the deal is kind of fixed, we should be just south of our line average right off the bat. 
Smittipon Srethapramote: Got it. And on the Chevron contract, can you talk about the factors that lead you to win it? How much of it had to do with pricing technology, capabilities of your platform? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I'm always a little remiss in these calls to blow our own horn, but we're obviously delighted there, a hugely important client here for us in the U.S., and the prior vendor had a position and was servicing them, so we were quite pleased when they decided to pick us. And I'd say -- if you listen to the playback, I think it's the product. I think we've got a product that's works and is working. And I think again, that these big oil companies are incredibly cautious and risk averse, and so I think our edge is real. We have a product that actually works. And so I think ultimately, that's the call. That's why we're getting picked. 
Operator: Next question, David Togut, Evercore. 
David Togut: Nice to see the 29% growth in direct MasterCard revenue in the quarter. Is this is a rate of growth you expect to sustain for the balance of the year? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. That was -- David, it's Ron. That basically was virtually 100% volume. So I think I mentioned in the last call, we've decided to kind of calibrate any kind of rate work in there and basically just go run that business hard. And so that business is almost pure volume growth. So the answer would be yes, I would say that our plan is to kind of sustain that 25% to 30% compounded growth. 
David Togut: Is that rate of growth sustainable beyond this year? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Again, I think I said this to you before. It's really just completely related to our sales investment. Right? So we have a base of x. We sell point, whatever, 0.4x. So that's what creates the overall revenue growth. And so for us, there's just all kinds of market opportunity. It's just really how much we want to spend to produce that 0.4x. So I'd say the old levers are in our hand. 
David Togut: Got you. And then shifting over to CLC, 16% revenue growth in the quarter, solid but down a little bit from what we've seen historically, which has been around 20%. Any factors behind that slowdown? Are these short or long term in nature? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I'm happy. I mean, it may seem like a slowdown, but that business has been growing 15%, 20% for kind of as long as we've owned it. So I would say, when we reviewed that a few weeks ago, it's hitting on every cylinder. The big account business is getting healthier. We've got a big railroad base there that's healthy. We're selling this small inn -- we call CheckINN Direct product like crazy. So I'd say that although 16% may not seem as much, because the bases may be getting bigger, we're still selling a lot. We had record sales in that business in the first quarter. So I'd say we're feeling good, David, about the performance there. 
David Togut: Good. And just to revisit a prior question, I think, from last quarter, you're working on a new product, I believe, in CLC. Where does that stand in terms of launch? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. It's a good follow up. They're still in test. This is a product that we call a brand-wide, where instead of having a network of thousands of hotels that you have to kind of look up, you'd have, call it, 5 or 6 brands when you went into any city that you could go to, that we think appeals to a different segment, a more convenience-oriented segment. So I think we probably will have some report for you when we talk next quarter on how that's going. But I'd say where in the final stages of getting that thing put together and tested. 
David Togut: And would that be priced at a premium to your existing product like Direct CheckINN? 
Ronald F. Clarke: No. Remember, all these products are actually priced at a discount. If you went as a user here and looked at this product, effectively, you're getting guaranteed 15% to 20% off the lowest kind of street price for the current product. This thing would actually have, I'd say, a little bit shorter discount, again because we're trying to push the convenience and simplicity of just picking any 5 brands in the city. We don't have as much volume obviously on the thing because we're launching it. So I'd say the discount won't be quite as aggressive, but we're hoping that people are going to like the convenience. 
David Togut: Good. We'll certainly look forward to seeing that. Just shifting over to the Shell fuel card acquisition in Germany. You've long had a goal to kind of use Germany as a platform to expand more into Europe, and I'm wondering whether this could be the launching pad for a Direct Visa card in Europe. And if so, when might that happen? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Again, I don't know if we've telegraphed it, but this has been a personal crusade of mine for quite some time. I mean, that -- we've said it before, those 4, 5 big Western European countries are huge in this business that we're in of fuel cards, and they're dominated by major oils. There's no kind of AllStar CCS-type companies on the continent itself. So getting a seat there and getting a book of business and being able to fund a group of people and sale is just -- I can't describe it. It's a huge deal for us in terms of getting positioned to make things work. We've got a system that works, and now we get people, literally, that'll be sitting there that can sell. So it's what you said. It's the reason we've been in the kitchen for the last year plus cooking kind of our version 2.0 card. We need a go-to market plan, right, for or capability. And so we're hoping to join those 2 things up. Right? As we build out bodies in that place, we'll then bring that product. So that's the game plan. 
David Togut: Would that be by end of this year? 
Ronald F. Clarke: I'd say probably not. I'd say, ask me again. We've got a huge update on that this month so if you can remind me to answer it again, I'll give you a better view next time. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Phil Stiller from Citi. 
Philip Stiller: I guess I wanted to just follow up on Shell perhaps the last time. The 12 countries, I just want to clarify, those are all Continental Europe? And then can you disclose the planned purchase price for I guess all of the assets that you're acquiring? 
Ronald F. Clarke: So, Phil, it's Ron. Yes and no would be the short answers. They're all Continental Europe. And no, we're under an NDA with Shell. So no on the second one. 
Philip Stiller: Okay. Perhaps more broadly, can you talk about the acquisition pipeline for this year? I think you said you want to spend about $500 million a year. How does the pipeline shape up relative to that goal? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I'd say good. We actually just had a review of that in the last couple of weeks. So I'd say we've got a series of kind of small, medium and large deals that are kind of next couple of quarters if they come to pass. So I'd say we're feeling good about where we're sitting in terms of '14 activity. We took a little bit of a breather in the fourth quarter to digest the -- what, we do 7 deals last year? 
Eric R. Dey: Correct. 
Ronald F. Clarke: But I'd say we're in a good place, Phil, now, to kind of move forward on some things. 
Philip Stiller: Okay. And then lastly on Brazil. I know you guys are facing some currency headwinds there, but can you give us an update on how that business is performing from a revenue growth and margin perspective? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. We ended up, as you know, acquiring kind of 2 new businesses there. And I'd say on plan so far. And the good news is kind of no surprises both in Q4 last year and Q1. And I'd say the exciting part, again, is not so much what we bought but really, our launch of our own fuel card product, which we haven't had before, and a broader launch of a food card product, which we repapered in a new format. So I'd say those 2 literally will launch this quarter or early next. So I'd say that the base deals are tracking the plan, and the exciting kind of new product rollouts are kind of 90 days away now. 
Philip Stiller: Is the fuel card product there incremental to the reselling relationship you have with Good Card? 
Ronald F. Clarke: That's what it is. It's basically -- we signed a deal with them, whatever, 7 or 8 months ago, and we've done the IT work to basically connect their network product into our issuing system. So we're about ready now to go prime time and launch a "FleetCor fuel card" in that space finally. So it's a big deal for us to get an actual fuel card. We bought that CTF, which is a different kind of heavy truck, gadget-centric kind of solution. This is a traditional kind of FleetCor fuel card to go after the SME market. So we're quite excited. 
Operator: Our next question is from Tim Willi of Wells Fargo. 
Timothy Willi: Two questions. First one, going back to Europe overall with Shell. Could you talk about I guess sort of the sales again and how you see the opportunity to put that in place and grow the business past the conversion? Is there anything you'll have to do dramatically different from the playbook you used in the U.S.? Or is it going to be pretty similar with the efforts you've enjoyed domestically? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Tim, it's Ron. I think you hit again another good question. I think the first thing I'd say is I think that's why Shell picked us, right? They obviously looked at some people. So I think that our capability, not only here -- but remember, our second biggest market is the U.K., where we have the same set of sales channels working. So yes, our plan is to -- in this case, leverage their brand right through the digital, through the web channels, leverage their sites. They've got a big branded network obviously in that geography, and our claim to fame is kind of our telesales kind of sourcing and recruiting. So those are the 3 kind of big channel plays that, to your point, we're pretty tuned up on. So we're working now kind of to get those things ready for the conversion to summer. 
Timothy Willi: Could I ask a question, just a follow-up on that? Sorry to do my second one. In the U.K., when you did the acquisition a couple of years ago in that market, you talked about investing in the sales platform because it was sort of a tired asset in terms of acquiring customers, et cetera. How should we think about -- like maybe an average growth of accounts in the U.K. I know the revenue there has been impacted by pricing and product development, but how do we think about like, your account acquisition success in the U.K. after buying AllStar. Is that double-digit account growth as you got into the marketing and sales engine of that entity? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I'd say in the couple of businesses, Tim we, had before, were probably -- again, probably around a 10% organic growth rate. And I'd say, in AllStar, we're not -- I'd say our volumes are not up. And again, the reason is we tried to get that business repositioned. We put it on our platform, we crushed the cost structure, we changed the rates and now, basically, what we're doing is -- it's taken us a year to create a couple of brand-new products for the business. We have a product called AllStar Premier, which combines universal coverage with about 20% of the sites having a deep discount. So a client can now buy one product that basically gives them universal acceptance but big advantage pricing in some select locations. And then b, next month, we're launching finally the Visa chip and PIN specs. We'll have an actual -- normal, if you will, in European standards, commercial chip and PIN card. And so we've been building up basically investment to got behind those 2 new products. So again, ask me the question in a few months whether our sales rate and that thing is picking up. So I'd say, it's on our plan. It's exactly what we planned that business when we go through 19% for the quarter. 
Eric R. Dey: That's correct. 
Ronald F. Clarke: So we're -- again, we're delighted with both the revenue and the profits. And as we say, we are moving to what we call our Phase 2 of that thing now, where we're in kind of the volume growth phase instead of the restructuring phase. 
Timothy Willi: And then just the last question on CLC. Is there a path or a thought at some point? Can that product be in Europe? You're obviously building out that presence on the Fleet side. I just didn't know if logically, at some point, through acquisition or just organic, you try to take CLC over to Europe or the U.K. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Another good question, Tim. I'd say we haven't figured that out yet. As you know, all these products, which creates the defensibility in our game and also creates the difficulty, per my Shell comments, is the network. And so the struggle for us is to find a hotel network where we can get the advantaged economics that we get here in the States. So I'd say no clear idea. But if you got one, call me. 
Operator: Gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn it back over to you for closing comments. 
Eric R. Dey: Thank you, everybody, for joining us today, and we'll see you next quarter. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Thanks, guys. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2013 Q4  (2014-02-05 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the FleetCor Technologies Inc. Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded today, Wednesday, February 5, 2014. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Eric Dey, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. 
Eric R. Dey: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. By now, everyone should have access to our fourth quarter press release. It can also be found at www.fleetcor under the Investor Relations section. Throughout this conference call, we'll be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and EBITDA. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be calculated differently than other companies’ similarly titled non-GAAP information. Quantitative reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today's press release and on our website, as previously described. Also, we are providing 2014 guidance on a non-GAAP basis. 
 Finally, before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements. This includes forward-looking statements about our 2014 guidance, new products and fee initiatives, and potential business development and acquisitions. They are not guarantees of future performance and, therefore, you should not put undue reliance on them. These results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release and Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Others are discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K. These documents are available on our website as previously described and at www.sec.gov.
 With that out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay. Eric, thanks. Good afternoon, and let me add my welcome to everyone. So upfront here, I plan to cover 4 subjects. First, comment on Q4; second, discuss some of our highlights from 2013; third, comment on our 2014 outlook; and then lastly, I'll discuss a bit our go-forward strategy. 
 Okay. So first off, Q4. Results for the fourth quarter were very, very good. We reported revenue of $256 million, up 26%; and cash EPS of $1.08, up 32%. So 26% top line, 32% bottom line. There are a few puts and takes baked into those numbers. So on the plus side, again, we had the same businesses continuing to perform well. Our U.S. business was up 18% for the quarter, and our U.K. fuel card business, up 28% for the quarter. Second, we did get a lot of help from our recent acquisitions, particularly VB in Brazil and Epyx in the U.K., our 2 biggest acquisitions. On the not-so-good side, the Q4 environment was not particularly helpful. U.S. fuel prices and U.S. fuel spreads were both unfavorable to the prior period. And we had a Q4 tax rate that was 2.5% higher than our full year 2013 average. So obviously, depressed cash EPS for the quarter. But look, overall, we're happy with our results, happy with this growth rate, and pleased with the exit rate we've got heading into 2014. 
 All right. So let me transition over to 2013's full year in which we reported revenue of $895 million, up 27%, and cash EPS of $4.05, up 35%. So 27% top line, 35% bottom line for the full year. 
 And since our IPO in December of 2010, so our first 3 years as a public company, we've grown cash EPS 31%, of 38%, and this year, 35%. So pretty good 3 years. 
 In terms of highlights for 2013, let me mention just a few things. So first, very good organic growth for the full year, approximately 11%. We're also pleased that we exited the fourth quarter with about $1 billion of run rate revenue for the first time. Second, 2013 was a fantastic business development year, the biggest in the company's history. We closed 7 acquisitions, including a couple of big ones, and we signed 6 distinct partnership deals all over the globe. Third, we got deeper and better positioned in Brazil, an important market for us, with these couple of additional acquisitions. And we entered Canada for the first time on the back of a couple of private label wins. So deeper in one market and entry in a new market. Fourth, we've gotten positioned in the telematics space, which is an interesting cross-sell area for us. So we're going to evaluate whether this could be an important new leg for FleetCor. And then finally, 2013 was a great capital markets year for FleetCor. Our FleetCor stock doubled in 2013. So pretty pleased with that. So, look, all in all, a really terrific 2013. 
 So let me now transition over to our outlook for 2014. We're providing guidance today of $1.080 billion in revenue at the midpoint and $4.95 in cash EPS at the midpoint. The $4.95 cash EPS reflects about a 22% growth rate over last year's $4.05. And on the revenue front, the $1.080 billion target, 50% of that is planned to be from international operations, so we expect to cross the 50% boundary for the first time. And we expect over 1/4 of our total revenue in 2014 to be from beyond fuel cards. So areas like food cards, hotel cards, transportation cards, toll cards, telematics products, et cetera. So as you can see, we're getting some decent geographic and product diversification. 
 In terms of the environment we're expecting in 2014, I guess, we'd say we expect it will not be very helpful. Specifically, we're assuming an effective tax rate that will be up 1% versus 2013. And that creates about a $0.05 EPS headwind, which backs our midpoint guidance down from $5 a share back to $4.95. Eric will speak a bit more about that in his section. 
 Interest rate and overall interest expense will be up in 2014, so unfavorable. And we're also entering this quarter now with U.S. fuel prices below the prior year. So again, overall, we're not expecting a lot of macro help in this guidance. 
 So let me talk a little bit about the bridge, the profit bridge that takes us from cash EPS of $4.05 in 2013 to $4.95 cash EPS at the midpoint for 2014. So that $0.90 delta, the make-up is, one, about 1/3 from the run rate. With the exit rate coming out of 2013, that should get us about 1/3 of the way to the target. Two, we're expecting continued strong organic growth from a number of our lines of business, through our planning our U.S. direct business to be up 13%; our CLC business to have another double-digit year; our U.K. business up another 20%; our Russia business up another 20%. So we're expecting a number of very strong growth rates in some of our largest businesses. 
 Third, we're obviously expecting some upside in our new assets, the 7 we just acquired. So we're planning more profit performance out of the Brazil deals, the Epyx deal, the Australia/New Zealand deal, even our NexTraq Telematics business. 
 And lastly, although not in our guidance, we do have additional earnings upside in the form of our business development pipeline, which, as you know, is always active for us. 
 So in summary for '14, expecting profits to grow again over 20%. A source of that is our current run rate, continued organic growth particularly in our largest businesses, more profits from the 7 assets that we just bought, and potentially, some upside in the guidance as we progress through the year, vis-à-vis our business development efforts. 
 So let me close out by talking just a bit about our go-forward strategy. So fundamentally, we're sticking to our game plan of build, buy and partner. So we'll keep building the assets we own mostly through more sales investment. We'll look to keep buying highly related businesses where we can shape the right pieces to improve profits. And obviously, we're going to continue to chase partners that have portfolios or partners that can bring new products for the company. 
 So although our overall game plan is unchanged, I do want you to hear a new emphasis on 2 things, 2 things in particular. One, we're going to be laser-focused on entering new markets, more of these top 20 markets. Obviously pleased with Canada, one of those this year, but we're going to keep trying to get into markets we're not in today. And two, we're going to continue to expand our product line. So again, about 1/4 of our business is beyond fuel cards, and we're going to keep on expanding in workforce payments. Again, ones that are highly related, where we understand the business. And we're going to continue to look at things like telematics that are obvious cross-sell opportunities. So more big markets and more highly related products will be part of our strategy. 
 And lastly, we feel FleetCor is really well-positioned going into 2014. We've got good organic growth, again, about 11% last year. We're finding our way into new markets. Expect more of that. We've had some success beyond fuel cards, about 25% of our business now. Of course, that gives us more addressable markets. Great BD, last year, 7 new assets. More profit potential there. And again, we've got ongoing sourcing and work for new deals that we're working on in 2014. So the message is lots of ways to keep the growth going. 
 So anyway, with that, let me turn the call back over to Eric so he can provide more information on the quarter, the year and the outlook. Eric? 
Eric R. Dey: Thank you, Ron. For the fourth quarter of 2013, we reported revenue of $255.5 million, an increase of 26% from the fourth quarter of 2012. Revenue from our North American segment increased 15.5% to $125.4 million from $108.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. Revenue from our International segment increased 38.4% to $130.1 million from $94 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. 
 For the fourth quarter of 2013, GAAP net income increased 13% to $68.1 million or $0.80 per diluted share from $60.1 million or $0.70 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2012. Included in GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2013 was $10.6 million in expense related to new stock awards granted and vested during the quarter, and an unfavorable tax adjustment due to a tax law change in Mexico, which adversely impacted the quarter results by approximately $0.02 per diluted share. 
 The other financial metrics that we routinely use to measure our business are adjusted revenues and adjusted net income, which we sometimes also refer to as cash net income or cash EPS. Adjusted revenues equal our GAAP revenues less merchant commission. We use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate the company's revenues net of the commissions that are paid to merchants who participate in certain card programs. The reconciliations of adjusted revenues and adjusted net income to our GAAP numbers are provided in Exhibit 1 of our press release. 
 Adjusted revenues in the fourth quarter of 2013 increased 28% to $237.7 million compared to $185 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2013 increased 30% to $92.1 million or $1.08 per diluted share compared to $70.7 million or $0.82 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2012. 
 For the fourth quarter of 2013, transaction volumes increased 14.9% to 90 million transactions compared to 78 million transactions in the fourth quarter of 2012. North American segment transactions grew 6.6%, driven primarily by organic growth in our U.S. businesses and the Telematics transactions we completed in April and October of 2013. Transaction volumes in our International segment grew 23.5% and were positively impacted by acquisitions closed in 2013. 
 Revenue per transaction for the fourth quarter of 2013 increased 9.7% to $2.84 from $2.58 in the fourth quarter of 2012. Revenue per transaction can vary based on geography, the relevant merchant and customer relationship, the payment product utilized, and the types of products or services purchased. The mix of which will be influenced by our acquisition, organic growth in the business and fluctuations in the macroeconomic environment. 
 When we talk about the macroeconomic environment, we are referring to the impact in market spread margins, fuel prices, foreign exchange rates and the economy, in general, can have on our business. 
 During the fourth quarter, lower fuel spread margins and lower fuel prices, primarily in the U.S., resulted in an unfavorable impact to revenues both in the North American and International segments. And although we cannot calculate precisely the impact of these changes, we believe it negatively impacted our revenues by approximately $3 million to $4 million for the quarter. 
 Changes in foreign exchange rates were mixed in the geographies most impacted, and overall, we believe negatively impacted our revenues by approximately $2 million during the quarter. 
 Revenue per transaction for the fourth quarter was up in both North America and the International segment. Revenue per transaction was up 8.4% in North America, due primarily to the positive mix impact of signing up customers who use higher revenue per transaction products than the average, organic revenue growth in many other lines of business, acquisitions completed in 2013 which have higher revenue per transaction products than the average, partially offset by the impact of lower fuel prices and fuel spread margins during the quarter. 
 In the International segment, revenue per transaction increased 12.1% which was due primarily to organic revenue growth in many of our lines of business, particularly in the U.K. Acquisitions closed in 2013, some of which had product at a higher overall revenue per transaction versus our line average, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rate in the quarter and lower fuel prices in some markets. 
 Now let's shift over and discuss some of the other drivers of our fourth quarter performance. First, in our North American segment, most of our lines of business performed well, resulting in an approximate 15% revenue growth rate in the quarter versus prior year. Some of the positive drivers in North America revenue during the quarter were similar to last quarter, including the continued exceptional performance of our MasterCard product, which had revenue growth of approximately 30% year-over-year for the quarter, driven primarily by increases in volume. The CLC Group, provider of our lodging card programs, had another solid quarter with 20% revenue growth over the fourth quarter of 2012. This revenue growth was driven primarily by increases in our CheckINN Direct product, which targets smaller account. 
 Results in our International business were again positively impacted by strong organic growth in our AllStar business in the U.K., which posted very strong double-digit revenue growth over last year measured in local currency. 
 Results for International business were also positively impacted by acquisitions closed in '13, which included acquisitions closed in Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, U.K. and Russia. And finally, the macroeconomic environment in our International segment was unfavorable during the fourth quarter. And although we cannot precisely calculate the impact, we believe it negatively impacted our revenues by approximately $2 million to $3 million. 
 Now moving down the income statement. Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $149.5 million compared to $109.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, an increase of 36.6%. As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses increased to 58.5% of revenue compared to 54% in the fourth quarter of 2012. 
 Included in operating expenses are merchant commissions, processing expenses, bad debt, selling and general administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to the additional expenses related to the acquisitions closed throughout 2013, and a $10.6 million noncash expense related to new stock awards granted and vested in the fourth quarter. The decrease in operating expense as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to adding acquisitions with lower overall operating margins than the company average, and the additional $10.6 million in stock compensation. 
 Credit losses were $4.8 million for the quarter or 10 basis points compared to $5.1 million or 13 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2012. The improvement in credit losses, which is primarily due to the continued improved performance in many business lines and the impact of acquisitions closed in 2013, which had products with historically lower bad debt as a percentage of billed revenue. 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 60% to $24.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 from $15.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. The increase was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions closed in 2013. 
 Total interest expense increased 62% to $5.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 from $3.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. The increase was primarily due to additional borrowing for acquisitions closed in 2013 and a slight increase in the interest rate on our term loan, due to an increase in our leverage ratio in the fourth quarter. 
 Our effective tax rate increased to 31.9% compared to 32.6% for the fourth quarter of 2012. However, both years have unusual items. The fourth quarter of 2013 includes an unfavorable income tax adjustment related to changes in the tax law in Mexico in December, which required the company to record approximately $1.5 million or $0.02 per diluted share in income tax expense, retroactive to the beginning of the year. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2012, there was an increase in taxes of $1.9 million due to the controlled foreign corporation look-through exclusion expiring for FleetCor on December 1, 2012, and which was not extended until January 2013. If you exclude the impact of these onetime tax adjustments, our tax rates would have been 30.5% in the fourth quarter of both years. 
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We have ended the quarter with approximately $386 million in total cash. Approximately $48 million of which is restricted and are primarily customer deposits. The company also has a $500 million accounts receivable securitization facility. At December 31, we had approximately $349 million borrowed against the facility. We also had $497 million outstanding on our term loan, and $635 million drawn on our revolver, leaving $215 million undrawn. 
 As of December 31, our leverage ratio was 2.2x EBITDA, well below our covenant level of 3.25x EBITDA. We intend to use our future free cash flow to temporarily pay down the balance on our revolving credit facility and securitization facility, and maintain liquidity for acquisitions and other corporate purposes. 
 Finally, we are not a capital-intensive business, as we spent $5.4 million on CapEx during the fourth quarter of 2013 and approximately $21 million for the full year. 
 Now on to our outlook for 2014. We expect total revenues to be between $1,070,000,000 and $1,090,000,000, adjusted net income to be between $418 million and $428 million, and adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $4.90 and $5. As a result, our guidance at the adjusted net income per share midpoint of the range of $4.95 represents a 22% growth rate over the $4.05 per diluted share reported in 2013. However, in 2013, our results include approximately $5.7 million or $0.07 per diluted share of non-recurring income tax favorability. Without this favorability, our 2014 guidance represents a 24% growth rate over 2013. 
 Some of the assumptions that we have made in preparing this guidance include the following: fuel prices equal to 2013 average despite the fact we are starting the year with fuel prices below the 2013 average; market spreads equal to the 2013 average; and foreign exchange rates equal to the current run rate. We are also assuming fully diluted shares outstanding of 85.6 million shares, a 1 million share increase from 2013; interest expense of $24.2 million; a 1% increase in our effective tax rate from 29.5% in 2013 to 30.6% in 2014. And just to remind everyone, in 2013, we had 2 nonrecurring income tax adjustments that resulted in a net favorable impact to our 2013 income tax expense of approximately $5.7 million. Without these adjustments, our 2013 tax rate would have been 30.9%. 
 And just to remind everyone again, in the first quarter, we reversed $1.9 million of tax booked in the fourth quarter of 2012 related to the controlled foreign corporation look-through exclusion expiring for FleetCor on December 1, 2012, and which was not extended until January 2013. And in the third quarter, legislation was passed in the U.K. that reduced the statutory income tax rate, which resulted in a $3.8 million reduction in tax expense booked in the third quarter of 2013. And finally, as always, no impact related to future acquisitions or material new partnership agreements. 
 For those of you that are looking for guidance for the first quarter, I want to remind everyone that our business had some seasonality and that typically, the first quarter is the lowest in terms of both revenue and profit. First quarter seasonality is impacted by weather, holidays in the U.S., Christmas being celebrated in Russia in January, and lower business levels in Brazil where most businesses are on summer break in the first quarter and the carnival celebration is also in the first quarter. Additionally, our volumes build throughout the year and our new asset initiatives gain momentum throughout the year, resulting in much higher earnings per share in the third and fourth quarters. 
 With that said, we are expecting our first quarter adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $1.03 and $1.07. Our first quarter guidance at the midpoint represents a 19% increase versus prior year when adjusted for the nonrecurring favorable tax item in the first quarter of 2013 discussed earlier. We have no plans to provide quarterly guidance going forward, but rather to update our annual guidance each quarter. 
 And with that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore. 
David Togut: Could you break out the organic revenue growth rate for North America and International, and also the organic revenue per transaction growth rate for each? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes, David, for the full year, if you look at our full year organic -- our full year revenue growth rate of 27%, about half of that through the year is from organic growth. And kind of the other half is obviously the full year effect of acquisitions that we acquired in the year. And the organic growth in the United States for the year ran around 11%, and was slightly higher in the International business for the year. 
David Togut: Okay. That's very helpful. And then as a follow-up, the $10.6 million of stock comp expense you mentioned for Q4, did that all fall into U.S. SG&A? 
Eric R. Dey: The majority of that was in the U.S., that's correct. 
David Togut: Okay. And then the growth rate you gave for direct MasterCard, 30%, that was a nice acceleration from what we saw in Q3 which I believe was high-teens. But I think you guided to 13% growth for direct MasterCard for this year, do I have that correct? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, that's -- David, it's Ron. That's the overall direct business which has another set of products in it other than the MasterCard product. 
David Togut: Got it. So is it possible to understand what direct MasterCard growth would be for 2014? 
Ronald F. Clarke: It's in that same kind of 30% range. And like I told to you, we took a bit of a breather on rate for a quarter and we're kind of back on our standard rate plan. So kind of 30% for the full year. 
David Togut: Okay. Did you quantify the acquisition pipeline for 2014? 
Ronald F. Clarke: No, but active. We've got a handful of deals we're working and a handful of partner things. So busy. We took a little break in the fourth quarter. We're busy again. We kind of raised the target internally to $500 million per year from $300 million. So we're -- given the size of the company now, we're trying to step it up. We did almost $1 billion in 2013. 
David Togut: Is most of that $500 million outside of fuel cards? 
Ronald F. Clarke: No. There's still a number of interesting fuel card, both partner and deals, that we're looking at, but we are on this whole workforce payment space as well, so look for a mix. 
Eric R. Dey: Yes, yes, and David, just to add to that, that $500 million is just a guideline. Again, people ask us that question all the time and obviously, we're very opportunistic around acquisitions and partner deals. So we'll close deals when they make sense. But we are targeting about $500 million a year. It could be more, it could be less. Just like it was last year, it was significantly higher. 
David Togut: That makes sense. A final question for me. Timing for possible launch of direct universal card in Europe? 
Ronald F. Clarke: No comment, David, yet. Still not closed in. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Phil Stiller with Citi. 
Philip Stiller: The outlook for 2014, I think you said 22% revenue growth at the midpoint. Is there a way to think about how much of that is organic versus from the businesses acquired in '13? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes -- hey, Phil, this is Eric. It's kind of similar to this year. I would say probably a little less than half is our target for organic growth. And as you know, historically, we've kind of guided people to think of our business as kind of high single-digit to kind of low double-digit organic growth kind of company. And that the guidance we provided for next year is kind of in that range. And then the remainder of that is obviously the full year impact of acquisitions that we closed in 2013. And it includes no new deals for 2014 or new partner deals that we've not already disclosed. 
Philip Stiller: Okay. With the acquisitions that were closed during 2013, it sounds like you're expecting some improvement in terms of the profit performance of those companies, which is normal for you guys. But can you give us some milestones to look out for? Which of the acquisitions might be the biggest contributors, and when would we see some of that upside? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Phil, it's Ron. I'd say probably half of the improvement will be in the second half of this year, and then the balance basically rolls in into 2015. And the 2 biggest deals that we did was the VB deal in Brazil and this Epyx deal in the U.K. They're the largest and will provide the most lift. 
Philip Stiller: Are there specific initiatives that you guys are working towards with those acquisitions that we could keep track of? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. As you know, every deal, before we sign and wire, we have a thesis, a profit curve, and so they're based on specific plans that we have. And so -- although, when we did the majority of the deals, I guess, in the second half of the year. 
Eric R. Dey: That's correct. 
Ronald F. Clarke: So I'd say some of that is getting underway now, Phil, kind of in the first quarter. But again, I'd say it's backloaded based on when we close those deals. But every single deal has its checklist of things we're trying to do. 
Philip Stiller: Okay. Last question. The chip and PIN rollout in the U.K., is there an updated timeline on that? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Great question. Finally closed. So Q2, we should be live in the market in Q2 with that product. And by the way, we'll be the first one in the U.K., we believe, if we get out in the quarter. So... 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Fodor with Autonomous Research. 
Glenn Fodor: Eric, just real quick. Apologies if you mentioned it, but restructuring and deal expenses in the fourth quarter, if there were any, do you mind calling them out and quantifying? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes, there was approximately $2 million in the fourth quarter, Glenn. 
Glenn Fodor: Okay. And how does that compare to, say, the third quarter? 
Eric R. Dey: For the full year, we spend about $5 million. So most of those deal costs were in the second half, so I would say most of those were in the third quarter. That's when we closed the other Brazilian deals, the larger deals. And there were some obviously associated with the New Zealand and Australia deals kind of at the end of the first quarter into the second quarter. But I'd say the majority were in the second half of the year. 
Glenn Fodor: Okay. And then, Ron, at times, you've been a little more direct in your comments on the deals and -- kind of reading between the lines, if they're close or not. I didn't really hear that texture today. And you talked about paying down the revolver with near-term cash flow. I mean, can we read into the fact that -- can we read anything into this that there's not likely to be anything sort of notable in, say, the first quarter, that you'll eventually get there, but, you say, first quarter not likely, or is that a little bit of a reach? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, that's a reach. I'd say, as always, we have things that are "close in" and farther away, and no different today. 
Glenn Fodor: Okay. Great. Then just a final last one. It's good to hear the guideline on $5 million of acquisitions, noting that it's a guideline. But any reason to expect you won't be able to get the same rates of ROI and accretion in future acquisitions and that you've gotten on past ones? And then also, what's the likelihood and potential to get even more accretion since you have greater scale and you'll load these things onto a bigger network and probably rip more costs out? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, that's another, I think, good question. So the first part of that, I'd say, it's deal-specific. So every deal we look that we elect to do, we've got some thesis of how we can make a lot more money. So I'd say the ones that we do, that's basically the only reason we go forward, Glenn. And we believe we can get a much bigger number. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. 
Adam Carron: This is actually Adam here on for Darrin. Just a quick one on the revenue guidance. You've kind of talked about your expectations for FX. Is there any way to sensitize what the revenue growth guidance would have been if you used the fourth quarter average exchange rate or even a constant currency growth rate? 
Eric R. Dey: Adam, are you talking about for the full year budget for next year? 
Adam Carron: For the full year guidance, yes, revenue guidance. 
Eric R. Dey: We really didn't look at it that way. Obviously, there's a -- we're in a number of different geographies around the world, so exchange rates are moving in different directions. Our 2 big currencies that have the most impact were obviously the pound, which is been moving more favorably towards the end of the year versus the Brazilian real, which has actually been moving more unfavorable kind of throughout the year. In terms of average, Adam, I don't have that calculation in front of me. 
Adam Carron: Okay. And then secondly, we talked a little bit some of the synergies that you guys are going to look to recognize from some of these most recent deals in the back half of the year and into 2015. I just wanted to see where you guys are at from earlier deals, particularly the AllStar acquisition and CTF in Brazil, what the existing runway is there for synergies and what we should be expecting in 2014? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Adam, it's Ron. I'd say we've made good progress. Both of those businesses have significantly higher profits than when we acquired them. I'd say, particularly in the AllStar case, it would be significantly more profit planned again here in 2014. And probably, we're getting a little later inning, I'd say, in the CTF plan, but we'll kind of going in a different direction there with the new products. So I'd say that one, we're really chasing kind of revenue growth more than profit growth this year. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Just a few quick ones, I hope, if you don't mind. Just on the -- you get a lot of questions about emerging markets. You talked about FX already. Can you give us a sense of what's going on in the ground in places like Brazil or Russia? Any surprises there? And roughly, how big now is emerging market, or maybe if you can just give Brazil as a percentage of revenue? 
Eric R. Dey: Hey, Tien-tsin, this is Eric. From an on-the-ground perspective, I would say, really, we don't see a lot going on from an economic perspective. I think our volumes are kind of where we expected them to be. I don't think that the GDP in both of those markets, I think, is still up. So I think, still kind of good from our perspective. From an FX perspective, unfortunately, you had the pound going in one direction and you got the British -- the Brazilian real heading in the other direction. So those 2 currencies have effectively mostly offset each other. So not a lot of headwind in FX, if that stays the course. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Right. Understood. And then just, I guess, I'll ask about the Europe market. Obviously, with WEX talking about the Esso deal, just curious what the implications are of that. Any implications to the Shell U.K. portfolio, and maybe just the organic, inorganic growth there competitively, any thoughts there? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Can you ask, Tien-tsin, that question again? What's the question, exactly? 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Yes, sorry, Ron. Just, WEX was -- gave a lot of airtime to the Esso deals. It seems pretty interesting on their side from a platforming standpoint. So my question is, does it change the competitive landscape at all, implications to say in your Shell, U.K. deal, that you've launched in the past. Just trying to get a sense of, if that changes the end market. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I mean, I think, a, it's -- a number of those things are still a ways away. B, I'd say it's a very big space that historically has been all oil companies. So I think, again, there's just plenty of runway over there if we have the right product set. So I'd say, stay tuned again for our plans there. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Okay. Okay. Two more, and just workforce payments. I mean, when you talk about workforce payments, does that look like some of the stuff at Edenred, who does vouchers, et cetera. I'm just trying to get a better definition of that. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, when we use that word, Tien-tsin, we're really talking about payments that go between the employer and the employee, fundamentally reimbursing. So we're not really in "corporate payments," like a bank doing AP or doing what WEX does. So our game is basically to call on people to deal with, get money to employees, and so that whole line of products kind of fits in there. Whether it's tolls or food or obviously, fuel or hotel, it's all basically money moving from the employer to the employee. So we like that space. That administrative ease is really well liked. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Got it. Okay. Last one, just kind of clarify some of the numbers that you gave, a lot of good data here. Just acquired revenues in the fourth quarter, and if I heard correctly, fiscal '14 is, call it, half of that is going to be inorganic versus organic. That would imply $100 million in acquired revenues for '14, is sort of the base case. Am I doing that math correctly, guys? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. The ballpark is kind of a couple hundred million in total, which is low-20s, so it's kind of 9 to 10, is our organic view, and kind of 10, 11 is the deal piece. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: And then the fourth quarter, Ron, I apologize. 
Ronald F. Clarke: The fourth quarter, I'd say, because of some of those headwinds, it would be -- I guess, the year was about 50-50 kind of low-teens organic for the full year and, what, 27 in total. So I'd say, it was probably 55 for the full year and maybe a little higher, Tien-tsin, in the fourth quarter because we had some of the headwinds that Eric pointed out in the quarter. So I think the acquisition piece would have been a little stronger than that in Q4. But again, we expect in our plans, so that to re-settle out basically at 50-50, which is what we've been on, I think, consistently, trying to grow the base business around 10 and then see what we can get done on top of that. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Smitti Srethapramote with Morgan Stanley and Company. 
Smittipon Srethapramote: I'm just wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on the CST outsourcing deal that was announced today. I'm assuming the numbers from the deals are included in your 2014 guidance. Just wondering when the -- when revenues will start hitting the bottom line for this deal? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Smitti, it's Ron. So I'd say our plan there is probably late second quarter in terms of that program, so we're taking over a portfolio and selling the product. And I characterize it as kind of a single-digit millions deal for us. 
Smittipon Srethapramote: Okay. So single-digit sort of millions sort of run rate, once it sort of fully ramps up by Q3? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Correct. And again, I think that the interesting part, one of the reasons we included this, is really the focus on new markets in Canada. We won this Husky thing -- when did we announce that? 4 or 5 months ago. 
Eric R. Dey: Correct. 
Ronald F. Clarke: So we got 2 of these, and now we have a product, Smitti, that works there. And so we're going to sell it directly, and we've got these 2 accounts. Husky also planned to kind of go live in Q2. So come the second half of '14, FleetCor will have some decent business in a market that we had effectively 0 revenue in last year. So that -- this, I think -- and part of the call-out on this is to make the point that we're trying to find ways to get into important markets. I think Canada's just inside the top 20 in terms of biggest, so we're pleased with that. 
Smittipon Srethapramote: Got it. And maybe just a follow-up question on Telematics. I'm just wondering if you guys have received inbound inquiries from your current customers on a global basis since you completed the deal back in Q4 last year? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, we're -- yes, so it's another good question. We're early in that, but I'd say the early returns we've restructured and integrated to sales groups. This NexTraq company we bought is actually here in Atlanta, and so we got now a group of those telematics sales specialists calling into the FleetCor client base, with a goal to prove out whether there's an interesting cross-sell. And I'd say, it's very early, but I'd say, very encouraging so far. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Willi with Wells Fargo. 
Timothy Willi: Just a couple of questions here. A lot of other stuff's been covered. Eric, in terms of interest expense, is what we saw in the fourth quarter a pretty solid run rate for '14 on a quarterly basis? 
Eric R. Dey: I kind of called out the interest expense in my guidance, Tim. We're expecting about $24 million of interest expense next year, and that will be spread pretty ratably throughout the year next year. 
Timothy Willi: Okay. Sorry, I must have missed that. I apologize. And then -- and second is regarding operating leverage and margins, obviously, a lot's going on here with new deals coming on at different margin profiles versus sort of the organic base business. Is there any way you could just sort of give some color on margin trajectory of sort of the core base business relative to the drag and improvement of the acquired entities? Are we still seeing appreciable margin improvement from some sort of those legacy businesses? Or are they a little bit more stable in the margin lift on a go-forward basis, is really driven by the assets you've acquired? 
Eric R. Dey: It's a little of both. Obviously, we have a lot of organic growth in the existing businesses. We called out in 2013, we grew our business organically, call it 13%. About 4% or  5% of that came from transactions, and the remainder of that came from revenue per transaction. So that would create a lift in margins in the legacy businesses. And then certainly from an acquisition perspective, we generally buy businesses that have a lower margin profile than the company's average. So typically, we'll spend the next year or 2 to improve the performance of those businesses, which would obviously then improve margins as well over that period of time. 
Timothy Willi: So just inferring from that, it would seem like is it a reach to think about there's probably margin expansion sitting here for the next 24-plus months if you don't do any other acquisitions from this point? 
Eric R. Dey: I don't know if 24 months is the right answer to the high or low, but I would say the answer to your question is yes. I mean, clearly, we're going to improve the performance of the businesses that we own and we're going to continue to grow the existing businesses organically. Again, given the fixed cost nature of our business, approximately 2/3 of our costs are fixed, so the majority of the improvement in revenue goes to the bottom line. 
Ronald F. Clarke: And remember, Tim, it's Ron, that we're constantly trying to sell higher revenue per tran products, which you see in our numbers. And so, obviously, that contributes to higher margins, right. The products are the "our step-up products" that carry higher revenue per tran, generally carry higher margin. So it's a density and scale thing, and it's a product mix thing. But you're right, there's a lot of moving parts, right? It's not only the other businesses, but it's things like stock comp and deal costs and severance costs, a lot of things, I think, make it difficult to see. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is a follow-up from David Togut from Evercore. 
David Togut: Just a quick modeling-related question. Eric, what's the right quarterly run rate for SG&A for 2014? I'm thinking about the stock comp number in Q4. I'm just wondering, should we think about stock comp being more ratable through the year, or does most of it hit in Q4? 
Eric R. Dey: No. It was kind of the -- the $10.6 million in Q4 was more of a one-time kind of hit or is a catch-up entry, so we've booked an entire year's worth of stock comp in the fourth quarter for that one particular item. We spent about $27 million in stock comp in 2013. And from a modeling prospective, we're currently assuming that it's going to be flat next year. But our compensation committee meets towards the end of the first quarter and usually, we have new stock grants that are issued at that point in time, so that stock comp number will probably increase after that comp committee meeting. So we can give you a better number kind of after that point in time. 
Ronald F. Clarke: It's Ron. And your question is kind of point-to-point. The answer is it would step down significantly, right? So our Q1, Q2 operating expense is planned to be dramatically lower than what we reported in Q4, dramatically lower. 
Eric R. Dey: But from a stock comp perspective, I mean, it's generally ratable throughout the year. There's not a higher number generally in Q4 than there is in any other quarter. There just happened to be that in 2013. But 2014, I just spread it throughout the year. 
David Togut: So I guess just the final piece of this, should we expect SG&A to grow in line with revenue in '14? 
Eric R. Dey: It's obviously going to be up less. I mean, we get economies of scale from our business. Our margins, we're planning a 22% increase in revenue, and there's a 22% also increase in kind of cash net income per share. And there's a number of reasons for that. One is we got the full year effect of acquisitions that are kind of hitting into the year. So again, the trajectory of those acquisitions is such where you see most of the improvement coming in, in the third and the fourth quarters, and exiting into 2014 -- '15. We also have a number of below-the-line items that are impacting our cash EPS next year. Interest expense is going to be up pretty significantly due to the financing of the deal, so we're calling out $24 million of cash interest expense versus kind of $16 million this year. We also have a higher income tax rate next year. We're going up kind of 1%, which is where it's kind of about $0.05 a share. And then the share count is actually going up about 1 million shares as well. 
Ronald F. Clarke: But I think, David, in terms of the model, think about it as the revenue is on a curve each quarter going up, and I think about the operating expenses being much more flat. And that goes with that we're restructuring the expense side of these businesses and putting in these programs. And so that what contributes really to the earnings growth, getting better each quarter, is there really won't be growth in expenses, any significant growth in expenses, as we roll through the quarters here. 
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the FleetCor Technologies Inc. Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2013 Q3  (2013-10-30 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the FleetCor Technologies Inc. Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to Eric Dey, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead. 
Eric R. Dey: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. By now, everyone should have access to our third quarter press release. It can also be found at www.fleetcor.com under the Investor Relations section.
 Throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and EBITDA. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be calculated differently than other companies’ similarly titled non-GAAP information. Quantitative reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today’s press release and on our website, as previously described. Also, we are providing 2013 guidance on a non-GAAP basis.
 Finally, before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements. This includes forward-looking statements about our 2013 guidance, new products and fee initiatives and potential business development and acquisitions. They are not guarantees of future performance and, therefore, you should not put undue reliance on them. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today’s press release and Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Others are discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K. These documents are available on our website as previously described and at www.sec.gov.
 With that out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay. Eric, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone, and appreciate you joining the call today. I'm going to plan to cover just a couple of subjects upfront here. First, I'll comment on our Q3 results and our full year guidance. And then second, I'll discuss a bit the 2 newest acquisitions announced today, NexTraq and Epyx.
 Okay. So on to the quarter. Really a very good quarter for FleetCor. We reported profit growth of 30% on $1.08 in cash EPS and 20% revenue growth on $225 million of revenue. So 20% top line, 30% bottom line. And over the last 3 quarters, our profit growth, measured in cash EPS, has been, for Q1, it was 50%; for Q2, it was 35%; and this quarter, 30%. So 50%, 35% and 30%. 
 So back to Q3. The drivers for the performance were really fourfold. So first, the U.S. organic growth this quarter of 14%, and really the same story driven by our universal products and our CLC business. International growth was also strong, led by our U.K. businesses, which grew 30% for the quarter. Third, we got help from our acquisitions, the Australia/New Zealand deals in the spring, along with a couple of months of our VB acquisition in Brazil. Just a reminder there, our NKT Russia deal and our CTF Brazil deal actually rolled off this quarter. And the fourth driver is a one-time happy from a favorable U.K. tax law change. That reduced our Q3 taxes by about $4 million, which increased cash EPS $0.05 for the quarter. So without this one-time tax happy, Q3 cash EPS would have been $1.03 instead of $1.08. 
 And then lastly, offsetting these 4 positive drivers, we did have a bit of a headwind in FX, which reduced Q3 revenue in the range of $2 million to $3 million.
 So in conclusion, the quarter had strong U.S. results, strong U.K. results, some lift from our Down Under and our VB acquisitions, a one-time tax happy, all offset by a bit of unfavorable FX. But by all accounts, for us, again, a very, very good quarter.
 So let me now transition over to guidance for the balance of the year. So today, we're raising guidance to $4.02 of cash EPS at the midpoint. This is the result of our Q3 prints and our 2 newest acquisitions, NexTraq and Epyx, which together will add about $0.02 of incremental cash EPS to the balance of 2013. And just as a reminder, we started out 2013 outlooking cash EPS of $3.65 at the midpoint. We raised guidance $0.10 in May to $3.75. We raised guidance again $0.10 in August to $3.85. We raised guidance again $0.05 in September to $3.90, as a result of the Brazil transactions. And we're raising guidance again today $0.12 to $4.02 at the midpoint. So we've been able to execute successfully this year on both our organic initiatives and our acquisition efforts, which have driven guidance up each quarter, again from when we outlooked $3.65 at the beginning of the year to $4.02 today.
 Okay. Let me now transition over to these 2 newest deals, NexTraq and Epyx, both of which we closed this month, October. Okay. So first off is NexTraq, which is an Atlanta-based telematics company. And NexTraq clients are also FleetCor clients. That is, they're predominantly small and midsized commercial fleets. The NexTraq service basically helps companies monitor their mobile workforce, knows their location, dispatches them more effectively, helps companies just generally get more productivity out of their mobile workforce. The team there has really done a great job of building the company. They've grown it into one of the top providers in the U.S. and recently reached 100,000 active subscribers. So our rationale for buying NexTraq is simple. We want to see if we can sell NexTraq services to our fuel card client base faster and more efficiently than the other providers. And, obviously, we've got a big advantage with our built-in client base. We have done some early testing on this marketing front and do have some positive results. But with this deal now, we plan to scale up our sales efforts to ultimately see how effective we can be.
 We like the idea of deepening our relationship with our fuel card clients and believe that joint clients, those on both fuel cards and telematics, should ultimately stay longer with us. We plan to keep the NexTraq management team in charge of the business, but at the same time, more fully integrate their sales efforts into our sales and service organization. If we're successful in kind of cracking the marketing and acquisition in this business, we've got the opportunity to export this to other markets like the U.K. and Brazil, that have enjoyed pretty good success with telematics thus far.
 Okay. Let me transition over now to our second acquisition, which is a company called Epyx, which is a U.K.-based fleet management provider. Again, Epyx clients are also FleetCor clients. So in this case, it's both vehicle leasing companies and commercial fleets that use Epyx service to simplify the admin of routine maintenance and vehicle repairs. So Epyx developed an Internet-based system that links their leasing company and commercial fleet clients to approximately 9,000 service garages in the U.K. that also use a version of the Epyx software.
 So Epyx has been able to sign up a number of the U.K.'s largest vehicle leasing companies and they help to manage over 2 million commercial cars and trucks along with millions of annual maintenance and repair incidents. They earn a transaction fee when their system is used to support a service transaction, making the Epyx revenue quite predictable.
 So our rationale here is straightforward. We've been looking for ideas to extend beyond fleet fueling into fleet maintenance because it's another very large expense area for our clients. And Epyx has obviously developed a system and an approach that helps leasing companies and commercial fleets better administer maintenance, really over the entire vehicle's life cycle. And we think there's a big demand for this. So for us, Epyx represents a really exciting idea, again to help us extend beyond fleet fueling. 
 So in conclusion, look, we had a very good Q3, with 30% profit growth. We're outlooking a very good full year 2013, roughly 34% annual profit growth if we hit the $4.02 guidance that we're giving out today. We've assembled a large number of new assets this year, the most in FleetCor history. 2013 deals included the Australia/New Zealand transactions in the spring, the series of Brazil transactions we announced in September and our 2 newest, NexTraq and Epyx, acquisitions that we have announced today. So we think we're really well positioned heading into 2014. We've got both solid earnings momentum, along with a number of new assets here that we think we can more fully develop. So all in all, 2014's setting up really well.
 So with that, let me turn the call back over to Eric to provide some additional commentary on the quarter and on our guidance. Eric? 
Eric R. Dey: Thank you, Ron. For the third quarter of 2013, we reported revenue of $225.2 million, an increase of 20% from the third quarter of 2012. Revenues from our North American segment increased 13.6% to $115.3 million from $101.5 million in the third quarter of 2012. Revenue from our international segment increased 28.6% to $109.9 million from $85.4 million in the third quarter of 2012.
 For the third quarter of 2013, GAAP net income increased 32% to $78.6 million or $0.93 per diluted share from $59.6 million or $0.69 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2012. The other financial metrics that we routinely use to measure our business are adjusted revenues and adjusted net income, which we sometimes also refer to as cash net income or cash EPS. Adjusted revenues equal our GAAP revenues, less merchant commissions. We use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate the company's revenues, net of the commissions that are paid to merchants who participate in certain card programs. The reconciliations of adjusted revenues and adjusted net income to our GAAP numbers are provided in Exhibit 1 of our press release.
 Adjusted revenues in the third quarter of 2013 increased 20% to $208.2 million compared to $174 million in the third quarter of 2012. Adjusted net income for the third quarter of 2013 increased 28% to $91.4 million or $1.08 per diluted share compared to $71.6 million or $0.83 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2012. Included in our net income for the third quarter was the impact of a one-time income tax benefit that resulted from legislation that was passed in the U.K. in the third quarter of 2013, which resulted in the U.K. statutory income tax rates being reduced. The lower statutory rates were applied to our deferred tax items, which are payable in future periods. As a result of the reduction in the statutory rates, our income tax expense was reduced by $3.8 million in the third quarter of 2013. The impact of this one-time income tax benefit on adjusted net income per share was approximately $0.05 per share in the quarter. Without this one-time adjustment, our adjusted net income per diluted share would have been $1.03 in the third quarter of 2013.
 For the third quarter of 2013, transaction volumes increased 6.4% to 84.3 million transactions compared to 79.3 million transactions in the third quarter of 2012. North American segment transactions grew 5.1%, driven primarily by organic growth in our U.S. businesses and the small telematics business we acquired in April. Transactions volumes in our international segment grew 7.8% and were positively impacted by acquisitions closed in 2013. Revenue per transaction for the third quarter of 2013 increased 13.2% to $2.67 from $2.36 in the third quarter of 2012. Revenue per transaction can vary based on geography, the relevant merchant and customer relationship, the payment product utilized and the types of products or services purchased, a mix of which will be influenced by our acquisitions, organic growth in the business and fluctuations in the macroeconomic environment.
 Revenue per transaction for the third quarter was up in both North America and the international segments. Revenue per transaction was up 8.1% in North America, due primarily to the positive mix impact of signing up customers which use higher revenue per transaction products than the average, organic growth in many other lines of business and favorable fuel spread margins during the quarter.
 In the international segment, revenue per transaction increased 19.4%, which was due primarily to organic revenue growth in many of our lines of business, particularly in the U.K., and acquisitions closed in 2012 and 2013, many of which had products at a higher overall revenue per transaction versus our line average.
 When we talk about the macroeconomic environment, we are referring to the impact of market spread margin, fuel prices, foreign exchange rates and the economy in general can have on our business. During the third quarter, the decrease in the wholesale cost of fuel resulted in slightly higher fuel spread margin. And although we cannot precisely calculate the impact this decrease has on revenue, we believe it positively impacted our revenues by approximately $1 million to $2 million, the majority of which was in the U.S. 
 Changes in foreign exchange rates were mixed, and overall, we believe, negatively impacted our revenues by approximately $2 million during the quarter. The foreign exchange rates that had the most negative impact on FX rates during the quarter were the British pound and the Brazilian real. The Brazilian real had the largest impact as it traded at an average of 0.44 versus 0.49 in the third quarter of 2012. The British pound traded at an average of 1.55 versus 1.58 to the U.S. dollar in the third quarter of 2012. And finally, changes in fuel prices were down slightly in most markets and, we believe, had a slightly negative impact on revenue.
 Now let's shift over and discuss some of the other drivers of our third quarter performance. First, in our North American segment. Most of our lines of businesses performed well, resulting in an approximate 13.6% revenue growth rate in the quarter versus prior year. Some of the positive drivers in North American revenue during the quarter were similar to last quarter, including the continued exceptional performance of our direct business, with increases in both our Fuelman product driven primarily by gains in both volume and favorable market spread margins, and our MasterCard product, which had revenue growth of approximately 19% year-over-year for the quarter. The CLC Group, provider of lodging management programs, had another solid quarter with 21% revenue growth over the third quarter of 2012. This revenue growth was driven primarily by increases in room nights in our CheckINN Direct product.
 Results in our international business were again positively impacted by strong organic growth in our AllStar business in the U.K., which posted very strong double-digit revenue growth over last year measured in local currency. The Mexican prepaid fuel and food business continues to perform well with revenues also up double digits in local currency. Results for our international business were also positively impacted by acquisitions closed in 2013, which included GE Capital's fuel card business in Australia in March and CardLink in New Zealand in April, and VB in Brazil, which was closed in August. And finally, the macroeconomic environment was not helpful to our international business in the third quarter, as I mentioned earlier, as fuel prices were down slightly in most international markets and foreign exchange rates were unfavorable in 2 of our largest markets, the U.K. and Brazil. 
 And moving down the income statement. Total operating expenses for the third quarter were $113.9 million compared to $101.1 million in the third quarter of 2012, an increase of 12.7%. As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses decreased to 50.6% of revenue compared to 54.1% in the third quarter of 2012. Included in operating expenses are merchant commissions, processing expenses, bad debt, selling and general and administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization expense. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to the additional expenses related to the acquisitions closed in March, April and August of 2013. Also included in operating expenses was approximately $2.2 million of one-time deal-related expense.
 Credit losses were $4.9 million for the quarter or 11 basis points compared to $5.8 million or 15 basis points in the third quarter of 2012. The improvement in credit losses was primarily due to the continued improved performance in many business lines and the impact of acquisitions closed in 2012 and 2013, which had products with historically lower bad debt as a percentage of billed revenue. Depreciation and amortization increased 33% to $18.1 million in the third quarter of 2013 from $13.6 million in the third quarter of 2012. The increase was primarily due to the impact of amortization of intangible assets related to the acquisitions closed in 2013. 
 Our effective tax rate decreased slightly to 27% compared to 27.8% for the third quarter of 2012. Included in income tax expense in the third quarter of both 2012 and 2013 were the impacts of income tax benefits that resulted from legislation that passed in the U.K. in the third quarters of 2012 and 2013 that reduced income tax rates. The lower statutory rates were applied to our deferred tax items, which are payable in future periods. As a result of the reductions in the statutory rates, our income tax expense was reduced by $3.5 million in the third quarter of 2012 and by $3.8 million in the third quarter of 2013. Excluding the impact of these one-time adjustments, our income tax rates would have been 31.7% in the third quarter of 2012 and 30.5% in 2013.
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $396 million in total cash, $50 million of which is restricted and are primarily customer deposits. The company also has a $500 million accounts receivable securitization facility. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $394 million borrowed against the facility. We also had $504 million outstanding on our term loan and $233 million drawn on our revolver. As of September 30, our leverage ratio was 1.63x EBITDA, well below our covenant level of 3.25x EBITDA.
 We intend to use our free cash flow to temporarily pay down the balance in our revolving credit facility and securitization facility and maintain liquidity for acquisitions and other corporate purposes. Finally, we are not a capital-intensive business as we spent approximately $5.2 million on CapEx during the third quarter of 2013.
 Today, we also announced that in the month of October, we have closed the DB Trans acquisition in Brazil that was previously announced. And we also announced 2 new acquisitions: Epyx, a U.K.-based service maintenance and repair network company; and NexTraq, a U.S.-based telematics company. In total, we spent approximately $400 million on these 2 acquisitions in October.
 Now on to our outlook for 2013. Given our strong third quarter results and acquisitions recently announced, we are updating our guidance for the remainder of 2013. We now expect revenue to be between $875 million and $880 million, up from our previous guidance range of $850 million to $860 million, adjusted net income to be between $339 million and $341 million, up from our previous guidance range of $327 million to $332 million, and adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $4.01 and $4.03, up from our previous guidance range of $3.87 to $3.92. 
 As a reminder, included in our net income for the third quarter was the impact of a one-time income tax benefit of $3.8 million or $0.05 per share that resulted from U.K. legislation passed in the third quarter of 2013. Without this one-time income tax benefit, our full year guidance would have been $3.96 to $3.98, and we expect income tax rates to return to normal levels in the fourth quarter.
 Based on our full year revised guidance, our fourth quarter adjusted net income per diluted share guidance is between $1.03 and $1.05, which includes income tax rates returning to normal levels, and approximately $0.01 to $0.02 related to the Epyx and NexTraq acquisitions, which are net of deal expenses and integration expenses expected to be incurred in the fourth quarter. Also, our acquired business in the U.K., Epyx, charges annual fees to customers, which are deferred and recognized ratably over the 12-month service period of the contract. Purchase accounting rules limit the recording of opening balance sheet deferred revenue to the future costs that will be incurred to service the related contracts, plus the normal margin. As such, we are unable to recognize approximately $1.3 million in revenues in 2013, which would ordinarily be recognizable if the fees were paid monthly instead of annually by the customer. This decrease in revenue is included in our Q4 guidance. 
 And finally, just to remind everyone, our business is subject to some seasonality and the fourth quarter is historically one of our slower quarters of the year due primarily to holidays and, in some cases, poor weather.
 Our guidance assumptions for the remainder of 2013 also include fuel prices and FX rates at current levels, market spread equal to the historical average, fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately 84.7 million shares, and a full year tax rate of approximately 30%. And as always, no impact is included related to acquisitions or material new partnership agreements that we have not already disclosed.
 And with that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Phil Stiller with Citi. 
Philip Stiller: I just wanted to check the details of the acquisitions. Eric, I think you said you spent $400 million on the acquisitions. Was that just for the 2 that were announced today, or does that include the DB deal that closed here in October? 
Eric R. Dey: Hey, Phil. This is Eric. Yes, that was just for the 2 new deals, so it did not include DB. 
Philip Stiller: Okay. And should we look at the $0.02 accretion in the fourth quarter as a run rate as to what these might contribute as we look forward? Or -- I know there's the deferred revenue headwind and some integration costs, or should we be thinking about a higher number next year? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Higher, Phil. It's Ron. Higher. 
Eric R. Dey: Yes, clearly, some of those -- I mean, the deal-related costs are going to spin out and eventually, we're going to lap the accounting adjustment we had to make in the Epyx deal because of deferred revenue issue, and that will fall off kind of as we get into the third quarter next year. 
Philip Stiller: Okay. Are you guys willing to share how material the acquisitions were in terms of the revenue guidance adjustment for the full year? 
Eric R. Dey: Phil, we don't disclose specifics around each of the deals, Phil. I mean, as you can imagine, it's very sensitive information as we're a very acquisitive company. And disclosing that information certainly is not helpful when we have conversations with other people. So we really don't disclose specific metrics around each deal. But you could probably assume that from a purchase price perspective, I mean, the multiples would be in line with what we paid in other transactions for the most part. 
Philip Stiller: Okay. That's helpful. And then last question for me. Obviously, you guys have done a lot of acquisitions here recently. Has this cleaned out the pipeline near term? Are you guys -- have enough on your plate to integrate here? Or should we be thinking about more deals as we move forward? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Phil, still busy, Phil. We've got a few small deals on the M&A side, and we've got a couple of, I'd say, material deals still in front of us on the partner side. So I'd say we continue to screen stuff. 
Philip Stiller: How much financial ... 
Ronald F. Clarke: But you're right, we do now have a lot as of today on our plate. 
Philip Stiller: And how much financial capacity will you have after these deals? 
Eric R. Dey: Hey, Phil. We still have pretty substantial liquidity. After giving effect of the deals we close in October, we probably have in the neighborhood of a couple of hundred million on the revolver and, obviously, we've got a fairly significant amount of cash around the world as well. And in addition to that, we also have the ability to draw an accordion feature that we have on our existing term facility. So from our perspective, I think we're in pretty good shape. 
Ronald F. Clarke: And we generate $400 million a year free cash flow. So I'd say, Phil, if you think out 6 months, those 3 or 4 things Eric named would give us all of the money we would certainly need next year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Smitti from Morgan Stanley. 
Danyal Hussain: This is Danyal Hussain in for Smitti. So I just wanted to follow up on Phil's question, that if you look at the acquisitions you've done so far, you're almost at that $1 billion target that I think you laid out before. So is there a new amount that you guys think we should be thinking about between now and in 2015? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I would say the answer is we have that financial target of kind of $300 million to $400 million in terms of task in our deal team. But as you can imagine, deals are bumpy and so we did do a lot. But I would say it's still a good target to think about next year and the following in that same kind of $300 million to $400 million range. 
Danyal Hussain: Okay. And then for NexTraq, is that something you'd be able to scale up pretty much immediately throughout the U.S.? 
Ronald F. Clarke: I'd say our first priority is not necessarily to "scale it up." As I mentioned, in my opening remarks, the job 1 there is to prove or disprove whether we can sell that product line to our clients in a more effective way. So I'd say we'll spend probably the first 6 months proving that out. And if it's successful, if our clients want this set of services, which we think they will, then we'll step on the gas at that point. 
Danyal Hussain: Okay. And then my last question is just on Shell Europe. I'm just wondering if you guys have gone live in any more markets in the last quarter? 
Ronald F. Clarke: We haven't, although they've got a -- the SI in this case, a company called CGI, it's got a number of markets kind of queued up. So from our perspective, our app is kind of ready to go into a bunch more and we're just waiting for them to give the go-ahead. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Carron with Barclays. 
Adam Carron: I guess first question was, in terms of these acquisitions that you guys announced, should we be thinking about these as kind of the way you've approached acquisitions historically in terms of the doubling the profitability over the first 1 to 2 years? Or do these kind of fall more in line with what we saw in Brazil where it's more of a longer-term strategic play? 
Ronald F. Clarke: I'd say the first thing, Adam, that you said. I think our thesis on these was twofold. One, that we could dramatically improve profit performance, which we believe we can. And then two, that they're big cross-selling opportunities because both of them share the same client base as ours. So that was the 1-2 punch. 
Adam Carron: Great. That's helpful. And then just a question for my own clarification. In terms of the NexTraq acquisition, I mean, how similar is this business to the business that you bought from Telenav? And kind of what's going to be the strategy in terms of combining both solution sets going forward, and how you'll look to go to market? 
Ronald F. Clarke: That's a really good question. The short answer is they're quite different. So this NexTraq deal, today's deal is what I'll call a traditional, kind of gidget-based, vehicle-based solution, kind of the traditional solution, that we look like a lot of other people in the marketplace with that solution. And the Telenav deal, which we announced in the spring, is really a handset, a phone-based solution where, again, our idea there is to create a FleetCor app that we could basically give to all of our clients and their drivers on their phone, basically not going into their gidgets. And so, they're pretty different in terms of what our objectives are, Adam, with the 2 businesses. 
Adam Carron: Great. That's helpful. And then just a last one for me. Do you guys have on-hand the organic growth for both North America and international during the quarter? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes, Smitti. The organic growth in North America -- oh, I'm sorry -- is mostly -- it's all organic in the U.S. effectively with the exception of the small Telenav acquisition, so it's just north of 10% in the U.S. And similarly, the international organic growth is in that kind of 10%, 11% kind of range as well when you factor out the acquisition. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore Partners. 
David Togut: The CLC had very strong revenue growth, 21% in the quarter, very consistent with Q2. On the Q2 call, you talked about introducing a new branded product for CLC. Can you give us an update on that? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, David. It's Ron. Still no big contribution in this quarter from that. I think it's still a bit in the kitchen, that product. So Q3 was a repeat really of Q2. This CheckINN Direct, what we call our product for kind of small, midsized accounts was just, again, just selling out. We just sold a ton of that product again. So the growth in that business is taking this product that was originally designed for very, very large accounts and dialing it down to fit the needs of a 10-person company, and that's who's buying it. 
David Togut: Got it. And then when do you expect to introduce the new branded product? 
Ronald F. Clarke: It's kind of in test now. I'd say we'd probably start to see some impact Q1 next year. 
David Togut: Okay. Got it. And then direct MasterCard growth slowed to 19%, obviously still a very strong number, but down from low-30s in Q2. How should we think about or kind of model out the growth rate of that business? And, in particular, how much sales resources are you putting behind it over the next 12 months? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, another good question. So I'd say that although we don't provide them, the volume dynamics looked similar this quarter to prior quarters, so the thing is still growing well volume-wise. We had a little bit of a rate hiccup, kind of fuel prices went south. And we took the gas off to get some more volume on some of the rate things. So I'd say that the volume grew faster historically than the rate here. And we actually just had a budget review this afternoon. We're going to keep investing more money, call it another 20% increment in 2014, to keep that line of business growing. So, again, there's almost unlimited demand geographically for the size accounts that we're going after. So it's really just a function of our sales investment. 
David Togut: Got it. And then you alluded to a possible launch at some point of a direct universal card in Europe and possibly tying a platform-based acquisition into doing that. Any update on the timing of such a new product? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Stay tuned. Not far away. Stay tuned, we'll be back to you. 
David Togut: Okay. And just, new Shell card in the U.S., when should we expect that launch? 
Ronald F. Clarke: It's live. It went live -- what are we now? The end of October? I think kind of the middle of September, David. They're boarding their first few clients. They're selling predominantly targeting larger clients on that product. They've done some kind of marketing launch. Their salespeople are basically in the market. They've built a pipeline. And we're literally putting the first few clients on that product as we speak. 
David Togut: I see. And final question for me, I think you alluded to the partner pipeline in your comments. When should we expect to see some of these larger partner deals be completed? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, again, on the partner side, my comment is we've got a couple of what I would call material partner things and another handful of kind of processing-related opportunities. All international, every one of these opportunities is international. I would say you'll probably hear back from us before we break for the holidays. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Tim Willi with Wells Fargo. 
Timothy Willi: I just had 2 questions here. First is just from a modeling prospective. This seems to happen every year. I don't think I've asked this question before, but sequentially, your rev per tran in North America dips down from 2Q to 3Q. Is that just something seasonal, or is there something around mix or what have you to better understand that? 
Eric R. Dey: Hey, Tim. This is Eric. It's really nothing specific around that sequential drop. Effectively, if you look back at the last couple of years, Q2 in 2012 and Q2 in 2013 were both very good spread quarters versus the third quarter of last year and this year. So effectively, it's just that. So there's no real issue to it. [indiscernible] just kind of dropping between the quarters. 
Timothy Willi: Yes. Got you. It makes sense. The other question was just sort of thinking about customer activity. I guess you're asked this, I think, on every call. I'll do it this time. But just anything around like same customer trends to sort of gauge the health of the economy in terms of what you're seeing in North America? And then maybe, I know you talked about the U.K. being up pretty dramatically on the revenue side. Just curious about same customer activity in that economy as well. Anything to point out? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Hey, Tim. It's Ron. I'd say it's marginally better, I guess would be my comment. It's not going backward anywhere now. It's obviously not "roaring." I'd say it obviously varies by market, but I'd say, it's kind of from flat to kind of low single-digits. We might get a couple of points of same-store growth now in a couple of markets. But our core tran growth, volume growth metric is still adding more clients, right, than we lose, adding more transactions basically than we lose is still the key to our volume growth. And although we didn't comment on it, we had a record quarter of what we call sales, which are new clients that we board in the quarter. The U.S. was up, I think I have it in front of me, 20% to 25%. Our Russia business was up 25%. Our CLC business was up like 40%. So we've had a great, really a great sales quarter and a great sales year, which although we don't talk about it because it's not in your guys' models is, again, I think a leading indicator of the health, that the core health of the company -- it says that the marketplace likes our products. So I'd say that that's what's driving most of our growth is new adds versus same store. 
Operator: Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2013 Q2  (2013-08-01 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the FleetCor Technologies Incorporated Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to Eric Dey, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. 
Eric R. Dey: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. By now, everyone should have access to our second quarter press release. It can also be found at www.fleetcor.com under the Investor Relations section. Throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and EBITDA. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be calculated differently than other companies’ similarly titled non-GAAP information. Quantitative reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today’s press release and on our website, as previously described. Also, we are providing 2013 guidance on a non-GAAP basis. 
 Finally, before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements. This includes forward-looking statements about our 2013 guidance, new product and fee initiatives and potential business development and acquisitions. They are not guarantees of future performance and, therefore, you should not put undue reliance on them. These statements are subjected to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today’s press release and Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Others are discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K. These documents are available on our website as previously described and at www.sec.gov.
 With that out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Thanks, Eric. Good afternoon, everyone. And as always, appreciate you joining today. Upfront here, I'll plan to cover just a couple of things. First, comment on our Q2 results, along with our full year outlook and then second, discuss some of the recent developments in the company. 
 Okay, so on to Q2. We released our Q2 results just a bit earlier and reported new all-time highs in both revenue and profit. We reported profit growth of 35% on a dollar and cash EPS, and revenue growth of 29% on $221 million in revenue. So 29% top line growth and 35% bottom line growth. The results -- these results were really a beat against our internal plan, and at a high level, driven by 3 things: First, strong U.S. performance, revenue growth up 11% with MasterCard up 30%, CLC, up over 20%. So again, continued strong U.S. Second, we had strong U.K. performance in the quarter, particularly our AllStar business, very, very good quarter. Certainly post the Q1 GFN system implementation that we just completed. Also happy that customer satisfaction levels there are now back in line with historic levels. Third driver would be the Russian, Brazilian and Down Under deals. So they're first time contributors here in Q2. And as a reminder, we did not own those last quarter, so obviously, some incremental lift. 
 So in summary, strong U.S., strong U.K. and 3 new deals drove the growth in the quarter. Our Q2 sales where we onboard new clients were also at record levels in the quarter. The U.S., up 45%; CLC, up 25%; Europe, across the board, up 22%. So again, new sales levels like this reaffirm to us the market's overall interest in our products. 
 We talk a lot about new asset performance in the company and our objective to double profits in the first year or 2 of owning an asset. We continue to try to grow businesses after that initial transition period. And today, I want to comment on AllStar in the U.K., and Efectivale in Mexico. We've owned both of those assets since late 2011. In this quarter, both of those businesses grew revenue in excess of 25%. So revenue up 25% both businesses, so obviously, very good lapping past their 1 year anniversary. 
 Let me now transition over to 2013 guidance. So as a reminder, we started out the year at -- out looking $3.65 in cash EPS at the midpoint. We raised that guidance $0.10 to $3.75 in our May call, and we're raising the guidance again today, $0.10 to $3.85. That would pencil out to about $3.90 at 2012 constant currency. Our analysis is just about a $0.05 headwind to our constant currency forecast if exchange rates stay where they are now. 
 The 2 primary drags on currency would be the pound at around 1.54 today versus 1.58 and the Brazilian real, around 0.45 versus 0.49 last year. So Eric will get into the more detail on the guidance when we get to his section. 
 Let me now shift gears and talk a bit about some of the recent developments, interesting developments for the company. So first off, Husky Oil, we announced the signing of Husky Oil in Canada to a full outsourcing deal. They'll transition out of running that program themselves. We're hopeful to have that thing up and running by the end of the year, and starting to see benefits as we head into 2014. I think it's particularly important because it's our first large-scale effort in Canada. It will cause us to build operational capability, and we believe will create interest with additional accounts there. So we're hopeful that this first step will do a lot to help us build out Canada. 
 Second thing you may have seen is the Visa Europe announcement. So we signed a partnership agreement with Visa, first for our AllStar business in the U.K., and then to work with them more broadly across Europe. So the program is to combine our GFN processing platform with Visa's Europe's EMV intelligent chip technology. And together, this will create some advantaged fuel cards solution. We believe that some of the major oils will be quite interested in these chip solutions, as they're used to their consumer book of business already using chip and PIN, so we'll certainly keep you posted on progress and timing as we get underway with Visa. 
 And then third, the Shell U.S. announcement. We've extended our relationship with Shell to now helping them here in the U.S. Our plan is to provide a new commercial card to Shell, and Shell plans to describe their program and their plans, add more detail in September. Our progress is good with Shell in Asia, putting in our GFN system. We actually got 2 more markets live last month, so that is progressing. So on balance there, it's just great to extend the work that we do for Shell, and pleased with that. So Husky, Visa Europe and Shell, all underway. 
 In addition to those 3 developments, we continue to work a number of late inning deal and partner initiatives, again, many in the late innings. We've got ample liquidity to chase these deals, approximately $900 million in liquidity. Our leverage ratio is 1.3 for the quarter, so really well under our leverage covenants. 
 So in closing, we're pleased with the quarter, with profit growth up 35%; new asset performance, great, our AllStar and Efectivale businesses grew over 25%; we had continued rapid new sales growth, double digit virtually everywhere. We signed these 3 new important relationships and we still have a slate of late inning, new deal prospects, with plenty of capacity to fund them. So I'd say that our view is we're in a very good place in the company. 
 So with that, let me turn the call back over to Eric. He'll provide some additional detail on the quarter and on our 2013 guidance. Eric? 
Eric R. Dey: Thanks, Ron. For the second quarter of 2013, we reported revenue of $220.9 million, an increase of 29% from the second quarter of 2012. Revenue from our North American segment increased 11.4% to $119.5 million from $107.3 million in the second quarter of 2012. Revenue from our International segment increased 57.1% to $101.4 million, from $64.5 million in the second quarter of 2012. 
 For the second quarter of 2013, GAAP net income increased 34% to $73.1 million or $0.87 per diluted share, from $54.4 million or $0.63 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2012. The other financial metrics that we routinely use to measure our business are adjusted revenues and adjusted net income, which we sometimes also refer to as cash net income. Adjusted revenues equal our GAAP revenues less merchant commissions. We use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate the company's revenues, net of the commissions that are paid to merchants who participate in certain card programs. The reconciliations of adjusted revenues and adjusted net income to our GAAP numbers are provided in Exhibit 1 of our press release. 
 Adjusted revenues in the second quarter of 2013 increased 31% to $201.3 million, compared to $154.2 million in the second quarter of 2012. Adjusted net income for the second quarter of 2013 increased 33% to $84 million or $1 per diluted share, compared to $63 million or $0.73 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2012. For the second quarter of 2013, transaction volume increased 6% to 79 million transactions, compared to 74.2 million transactions in the second quarter of 2012. 
 North American segment transactions grew 4.6%, driven primarily by organic growth in our U.S. businesses and the small Telematics business we acquired in April. 
 Transaction volumes in our International segment grew 8.4%, and were positively impacted by acquisitions closed in 2012 and 2013. Adjusted revenue per transaction for the second quarter of 2013 increased 22.6% to $2.55, from $2.08 in the second quarter of 2012. Adjusted revenue per transaction can vary based on geography, the relevant merchant and customer relationship, the payment product utilized and the types of product or services purchased. A mix of which will be influenced by our acquisitions, organic growth in the business and fluctuations in the macroeconomic environment. 
 When we talk about the macroeconomic environment, we are referring to the impact of market spread margins, fuel prices, foreign exchange rates and the economy in general can have on our business. During the second quarter, the increase in the wholesale cost of fuel resulted in slightly lower fuel spread margins, and although we cannot precisely calculate the impact this increase has on revenue, we believe it negatively impacted our revenues by approximately $1 million to $2 million, the majority of which was in the U.S. and the U.K. Changes in foreign exchange rates were mixed, and overall, had an unfavorable impact on our business during the quarter. And finally, changes in fuel prices were down slightly in most markets, and we believe had a slightly negative impact on revenue. In total, we believe the slight decrease in fuel prices and change in foreign exchange rates negatively impacted the second quarter revenue by another $1 million to $2 million. 
 Adjusted revenue per transaction for the second quarter was up in both North America and the International segments. Revenue per transaction was up 6.2% in North America, due primarily to the positive mix impact of signing up customers, which use higher revenue per transaction products than the average. Organic revenue growth in those other lines of business, partially offset by unfavorable fuel spread margins and lower fuel prices. 
 In the international segment, adjusted revenue per transaction increased 44.9%, which was due primarily to organic revenue growth in many of our lines of business and acquisitions closed in 2012 and 2013, many of which had products at a higher overall revenue per transaction versus our line average. 
 Now let's shift over and discuss some other drivers of our second quarter performance. First, in our North American segment, most of our lines of business performed well, resulting in an approximate 11.4% revenue growth rate in the quarter versus prior year. Some of the positive drivers of North American revenue during the quarter were similar to last quarter, and included the continued exceptional performance of our direct market MasterCard product, which had revenue growth of approximately 32% year-over-year for the quarter. The CLC Group, provider of lodging management programs continued to perform well and had another solid quarter, with 22% revenue growth over the second quarter of last year. This revenue growth was driven primarily by increases in room nights and our check-in direct product. 
 Results in our International business were positively impacted by strong organic growth in our AllStar business in the U.K. and our independent fuel card provider based in Russia, PPR, which both posted very strong, double-digit revenue growth over last year, measured in local currency. 
 Also, the Mexican prepaid fuel and food business continues to perform well, with revenues also up double digits in local currency. Results for our International business were also positively impacted by acquisitions closed in 2012. As a reminder, CTF in Brazil and NKT in Russia and acquisitions that we closed in 2013; GE's Capital fuel card business in Australia and CardLink in New Zealand in March and April, respectively, of this year. 
 The macroeconomic environment was not helpful to our business in the second quarter as market spreads in the U.K. were down slightly, fuel prices were down slightly in most international markets, and foreign exchange rates were unfavorable in 2 of our largest markets, the U.K. and Brazil. The British pound had the largest impact, which was traded at an average of approximately 1.54 versus 1.58 to the U.S. dollar in the second quarter of 2012. And the Brazilian real traded an average of 0.49, which was slightly below our expectation for the quarter. Although we cannot precisely calculate the impact of changes in fuel spread and fuel price, we believe the macroeconomic environment in total, negatively impacted our revenues by approximately $2 million to $3 million in the second quarter of 2013 versus the second quarter of 2012. 
 Now moving down the income statement. Total operating expenses for the second quarter were $111.8 million, compared to $90.4 million in the second quarter of 2012, an increase of 23.7%. Included in operating expenses are merchant commission; processing expenses; bad debt; selling, general and administrative expenses; and depreciation and amortization expense. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to the additional expenses related to acquisitions closed in June and July of 2012 and March and April of 2013. Also included in operating expenses was approximately $2 million of onetime deal-related expenses. 
 As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses decreased to 50.6% of revenue, compared to 52.6% in the second quarter of 2012. Credit losses were $4.7 million for the quarter or 10 basis points, compared to $6 million or 15 basis points in the second quarter of 2012. The improvement in credit losses was primarily due to the continued improved performance in many business lines and the impact of acquisitions closed in 2012 and 2013 which had products with historically lower bad debt as a percentage of billed revenue. 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 36.9% to $15.9 million in the second quarter of 2013, from $11.6 million in the second quarter of 2012. The increase was primarily due to the impact of amortization of intangible assets, related to 2 acquisitions closed in 2012, and 2 acquisitions in 2013. 
 Our effective tax rate decreased 30.6%, compared to 30.9% for the second quarter of 2012. The decrease in the second quarter of 2013 tax rate was primarily due to a shift in the mix of earnings to foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates. 
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $341.4 million of total cash, $48.5 million of which is restricted and are primarily customer deposits. The company also has a $500 million accounts receivable securitization facility. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $402 million borrowed against the facility. We also had $511 million outstanding on our term loan, and $97 million drawn in our revolver. We have over $900 million in liquidity to continue our global business development efforts and for general working capital purposes today. 
 As of June 30, our leverage ratio was 1.3x EBITDA, well below our covenant level of 3.25x EBITDA. We intend to use our free cash flow to temporarily pay down the balance on our revolving credit facility and securitization facility, and maintain liquidity for acquisitions and other corporate purposes. 
 Finally, we are not a capital intensive business as we've spent approximately $5.3 million on CapEx during the second quarter of 2013. 
 Now on to our outlook for 2013. Given our strong second quarter results and outlook for the remainder of the year, we are updating our guidance for the remainder of 2013. We now expect revenue to be between $825 million and $835 million, up from our previous guidance range of $810 million to $820 million. We expect adjusted net income to be between $322 million and $327 million, up from our previous guidance range of $310 million to $320 million. And adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $3.82 and $3.87, up from our previous guidance range of $3.70 to $3.80. As a result, our guidance at the adjusted net income per share, midpoint of the range of $3.85 represents a 29% growth rate over 2012. Our guidance assumptions for the remainder of 2013 are as follows: Fuel prices and FX rates at July levels; market spreads equal to the historical average; fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately 84.7 million shares; and a full year tax rate of approximately 30%, down from our previous guidance of 30.6%. The decrease is due primarily to the mix impact of our international operations, which have tax rates lower than the company average. And as always, no impact related to acquisitions or material new partnership agreements that we have not already disclosed. 
 As I mentioned above, our guidance assumes that foreign exchange rates will continue to be a headwind in the second half of 2013. Unfortunately, the July run rate in foreign exchange rates is much lower than the first half of the year average, primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening against the U.K. pound and the Brazilian real. As a result, our second half of the year guidance has been negatively impacted by approximately $0.05. 
 And with that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of David Togut with Evercore Partners. 
David Togut: Ron, could you drill down a little bit into the drivers of the 45% new sales growth from the U.S.? Were there particular products that contributed a large amount of that? And if also, if you could give us a sense of the drivers of the 22% gain in European new sales as well? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Hey David, it's really investment. We're just spending more in the new channels that we invest in, like telesales and web. In fact, I think, for the U.S., what we call the non-field channels, sales were actually up 100%, period to period. So it's really less about product and more about, a, total spend; and b, channel mix, what we're doing in terms of channels. It'd the same thing, if the follow-on was Europe. For example, the Russia sales, I think, were up 50% in the period. Same thing, we now have web working and some partner programs working there. So I'd say it's more marketing and sales driven than it is product driven. 
David Togut: I see. That helps. Can you maybe elaborate a little bit on direct MasterCard? I think that was up 47% year-over-year in Q1, up 32% year-over-year in Q2. Anything to read into that or was it just a difficult comparison? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Again, it's the same thing. It's just those growth rates are a function of the ratio or relationship between the base of that business, which continues to grow, and what we sell in new business, which also continues to grow. So for us to maintain, let's say, a 40% growth rate point-to-point, we'd have to continue, David, to spend more incrementally in sales to maintain that level. So it's really, for us, just an investment call. But the product has enormous potential geographically and really the limitation is just what we're willing to spend. 
David Togut: I see. Quick final question for me on the, I guess, on the CITGO departure in the quarter, can you give us some insight as to why CITGO went elsewhere, and is that material at all to revenue and earnings? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, not so much would be, I guess, the headline. It is -- I think, as Eric relayed before, it's immaterial to our overall numbers and we just don't comment generally on individual contracts. What I'd say is we still are generally happy in terms of winning more than we lose. So when you're in a game, you're going to lose sometimes, so in this case, we did. 
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs. 
Roman Leal: It's Roman in for Julio. First question on International, if we can drill down into the revenue per transaction strength there, even if we can ballpark what the revenue per transaction would have been without the new acquisitions that started to contribute this quarter just so we can see kind of the incremental contribution and also the new kind of run rate for the rest of the business? 
Eric R. Dey: Roman, this is Eric. If you exclude the impact of the acquisitions, the International revenue per tran would have been $2.30 versus $1.91 prior year, so up kind of $0.40 point-to-point. 
Roman Leal: Okay, so there's that piece of it growing and a positive mix shift of the new acquisitions. And what other new acquisitions -- what types of products are you offering there that have such a higher yield relative to the average in International? 
Eric R. Dey: We have many different kind of products. Again, if you go back and you look at what was not in our business last year, we have CTF, which we acquired in July of last year. It's a different kind of product. It's a RF-based technology so the transactions are much larger. So the revenue per transaction for that product is also much larger. And you look at our Russia business, which we added in June of last year, that has a different kind of model, as well, Roman. It's more software sales or it was a year ago, historically. So those transactions are a little lumpier but they can be higher revenue per transaction products. And our New Zealand and Australia business are more card-type products, so the revenue per tran there is more in line with our outline [ph] average. 
Roman Leal: Okay. That's helpful. And on the Visa Europe partnership, can you maybe give us an example of the type of maybe products or -- I mean, is this going to look a lot like the universal card product in the U.S. or is it going to be completely different? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Roman, it's Ron. So a couple of things. The first thing which we're a few years into developing, would be our AllStar card. So it looks like the AllStar card we had today, but instead of being magstripe, it would be a chip card. So in terms of the cosmetics, card design, it would look similar but when you get to the point of sale, obviously it will operate like a chip card. And by moving some intelligence down to the point of sale, you get advantages that you can't get basically on a mag card. So that would be kind of the first implementation, which we're expecting kind of early Q1 next year. And then second, the second question is, yes, we've got some plans with Visa to create cards that would work in "other markets" on the Continent but we're not going to describe in some detail yet what they are but they would be similar, I would say, to what you see here. 
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays Capital. 
Adam Carron: This is actually Adam Carron here for Darrin. Just a question on International growth, do you guys have an organic growth number for the quarter? 
Eric R. Dey: We do. If you exclude the impact of the acquisitions, our International business grew organically kind of in the 16% range, give or take. 
Adam Carron: Okay. So I'm just going to try and figure out, in terms of what types of synergies we should kind of still be expecting from some of these recent acquisitions. Obviously, AllStar and Efectivale continue to grow very well, you mentioned 25% during the quarter. I mean, is there any way to kind of ballpark where we're at with, I guess, the 4 acquisitions acquired in 2011 and 2012 from a synergy standpoint and how much you think is left to get out of these? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I'd say the way to think about it, in the first 1 to 2 years, it's pretty steep because we tend to transform the model and the structure of those businesses. And then kind of beyond 2 years or call it 1.5 years, where we are with AllStar and Efectivale, it's kind of Phase 2, which is our growth program where we introduce new products and new channels. So the stated goal we have is kind of doubling profits in every business within the first 2 years and then obviously, growing those businesses above line average, so call it 10% to 15% top line post the first 2 years would probably be a target. 
Adam Carron: All right. That's very helpful. And then last one for me. Just in terms of North America growth, I know the environment was in there for 1 million or 2 million. I think last quarter, you kind of mentioned that we should be kind of expecting a 15% type of growth rate over the balance of the year. I mean, does that still kind of hold here or you're looking for a growth more in line with what we're seeing this quarter? 
Eric R. Dey: Really, what we're referring to is kind of a full year average. I mean, the first quarter grew at such a high rate. We weren't expecting that for the balance of the year. We weren't saying it was going to be 15% a quarter as much as it was kind of going to average around 15% for the whole year, somewhere around there. So clearly, going to be a little bit lower the rest of the year. 
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Phil Stiller with Citi. 
Philip Stiller: I just wanted to follow-up on the Visa Europe deal. Can you talk about the potential impact to economics from a move towards Visa? And then as you think about moving it beyond AllStar, should we think about it primarily as a tool to get new oil partnerships or it's something that you might go direct to customers with? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Phil, it's Ron. Good question. I'd say in the U.K., it would be a plus. Economically, we think that the value basically, to the accounts is high as we introduce that, plus there's expense benefits like in fraud and so on. So I'd say it'd be a net plus in the U.K. And then on the second question, it would be both. We have oil partners interested in it and we obviously have direct aspirations for that product as well. 
Philip Stiller: Okay. And then also in Europe, any comments on the EC proposal to cap the interchange there? It doesn't seem like there would be a direct impact on the business, but any tangential impacts that we could think about? And if you could ballpark roughly, what percentage of your business comes from merchant fees in Europe, that would be helpful. 
Eric R. Dey: Phil, this is Eric. First and foremost, I think we're not really anticipating any impact related to that new legislation. Obviously, that legislation was geared more toward commercial -- I meant consumer cards. So again, we're not anticipating any impact whatsoever. In terms of your second part of your question, I don't have that information with me right now, so maybe we can follow-up on that later. 
Philip Stiller: Okay, sounds good. And then lastly for me, on the Shell extension to the U.S., should we think about it along the lines of what you're doing for them internationally where it's a processing relationship or is it something that's broader than that? 
Ronald F. Clarke: It's a new card program, Phil, that they're going to describe in some detail in a launch this fall, so it's a different service than we provide to them as part of that GFN contract. For us, it's just, again, I think we've touted this repeatedly that we value those giant relationships and to the extent that we can perform in one place. We're in a lot of other places that Shell's in. Our hope is they'll sign us up to work with then in additional places. 
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: I guess, sticking with macro, I think I always ask this, but let me ask about same-store growth. It looks like transaction growth picked up a little bit. Eric, you talked about organic growth getting a little better. Does it feel like, Eric, around that you're getting a little bit of a lift from same store in some of the regions, that more so than, say, last quarter or not really? 
Eric R. Dey: Tien-Tsin, this is Eric. As always, it's a bit of a mixed bag. I'd say in the United States, we're certainly seeing transactions, I would say, flat to up a little bit. So same-store sales, kind of picking up a little. And then when you look at it internationally, I mean clearly, it varies pretty dramatically in each of the markets and mostly Europe is still under a recession. So I would say, transaction volumes there or same-store sales are certainly flat-to-down, generally speaking in most of the markets. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Understood, so flat-to-down, okay. And just -- I know you've got a lot of questions on Visa Europe. Just curious, did not having the chip card capability preclude you from pursuing certain deals? Just trying to understand if there's any, I guess, pent-up demand associated with that beyond the technical benefits. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I just think it's late, Tien-Tsin. If you look at the Continent there, they've been a longtime now, the normal consumer walking around with a chip card, unlike us here. And fuel cards because they run on pretty old systems that are multi-country. And I guess, their view of the importance of that against their consumer-products have been late, pretty late to the party. So I'd say the oils over there have been talking and thinking about how to get their commercial businesses over for probably 4 to 5 years. And we, through this AllStar deal, have actually been working on this for probably 3 to 4 years in terms of creating a spec that works and is tested and has been deployed at a bunch of big brands there. And now the work has been integrating that with GFN so we have a processing engine. So I would say, we believe from conversations, that there will be a fair amount of interest if we can help the oils get the chip faster. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Okay, makes sense. And then just on the deal pipeline, more maybe the partner pipeline, organic deals, things of that nature. Did they look more like the Husky kind of arrangement or could they be smaller or larger? Just trying to get a sense of what's available potentially here at the second half of the year? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I'd say on both fronts, if you were looking at our partner pipeline, it is a mix, right, of a, GFN kind of processing type of opportunities; b, new card program like a chip card program would be as an opportunity; as well as a couple of call outsourcing opportunities. And I'd say the same thing on the acquisition side. We've got deals that are kind of small, medium, large that are being worked. So again, I'd emphasize that despite announcing a few things, we are kind of full up with work and it's a range of stuff. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Smitti Srethapramote with Morgan Stanley. 
Smittipon Srethapramote: You guys have talked about potentially considering new products outside of the traditional fuel and lodging segment such as payroll. Can you give us an update of how you're far along in this initiative? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. I would say that we have studied the set of other, what we call, workforce or employer payment products, right, where the employer is basically trying to control employee spending. And have identified a couple of those kind of products that we've got a high interest in. And our interest is they're virtually the same model as what we're in. They're sold to employers, they tend to run often times on proprietary networks, they have similar kind of economic structures split between merchants and customers. So I would say that directionally, people should expect us to head in that direction, to be in products beyond fuel cards and lodging cards. 
Smittipon Srethapramote: Is this going to be sort of a 2014 event, 2015 event? 
Ronald F. Clarke: It could maybe even be sooner. Stay tuned on that question. 
Smittipon Srethapramote: And maybe just a quick follow-up. Can you give us an update on how the heavy truck card product is faring? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Can you repeat that? 
Smittipon Srethapramote: Yes, can you give us an update on how the heavy truck card product is faring? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I'd say that is still early for us. And again, it's something that we're trying to do selectively. We've got pretty good partner relationships there and so I'd say, we're treading relatively carefully in terms of channel conflict and stuff. So I'd say that thing is still pretty early for us. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Willi with Wells Fargo. 
Timothy Willi: I have 2 questions. One was going back to the CLC products. You talked about broadening out distribution, some innovation around product and even the breadth of the network. Could you just maybe sort of give an update about how you feel, where you're at in sort of maximizing all of those opportunities? If the 20% growth, could that accelerate further as this stuff comes along or do you feel like this is sort of the run rate of that business? 
Ronald F. Clarke: I'd say that the old line, until you're out of ideas, right? So we're not. But I'd say that the last couple of years, the big driver, Tim, has been that what we call those CheckINN Direct card or small account card. The thing is still on a tear and creating the majority of the growth. But we've done a couple of new things since. We've gone back and started to look at expanding the actual merchant network, so we're growing the network probably 10% or 15% this year from where it was a year ago. So that adds more trans and more dollars for us. And two, we're about to launch a new, what we call, brand-wide or branded product. So instead of having a network that Ron's Tree Cutting can look and find 50 hotels in Atlanta, he basically could stay in any one of these 4 brands in Atlanta. And so there is some appeal, basically, of repackaging that product, which is close to being launched. So I would say that the momentum is good in the basic products and channel stuff that we have and we have additional ideas, like always, to try to keep layering on it. 
Timothy Willi: And is that -- just to think about modeling, if that were to come to fruition, is that generally the highest revenue per transaction product to have along your transaction based products? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. The CheckINN Direct product would be the highest in the company. 
Timothy Willi: Okay. That's good to keep in mind. Second question I had is just sort of going back to MasterCard and maybe just thinking about the growth you had there and the market. So you guys have done a tremendous job with that product. Is there anything that keeps other key companies from saying, "Geez look what FleetCor is doing, maybe we should think about doing a product like this and throwing some marketing dollars behind it?" Is it just focus? Is there something that you guys have that a Voyager or a WEX or a bank just really couldn't match and they really can't get into this product like you have? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Well, you mention people like Voyager and WEX, they've had -- the 2 of them -- I don't know how old those companies are, but they're 20 years plus. They've had kind of almost universal cards, Tim, for 20 to 25 years, and we've had one for 5. So obviously, whatever -- I don't know if they're going to do something new, but they've been at that game for quite a while and I think what it shows is that, like always, there's a lot more to a business than the product. There's a lot, obviously, around the marketing and sales and service model and there's a ton in the IP that we have around how you get money and make money in these businesses. So I wouldn't be so smug to sit here and say some other big bank or someone else couldn't get in, couldn't figure it out, but I'd say it's not easy. We've spent years figuring out, we've got a lot of people in this space and so look, there's a lot of room, we welcome other people. We're doing fine at it and it's not as easy as it looks, I guess, I'd say. 
Timothy Willi: And then just the last follow-up and I'll hop off. Just relative to that product again. You talk about spending money on marketing channels, et cetera, it's probably as big a driver as anything. As you guys measure the marketing spend and ROIs, I mean, are we at a point where the absolute dollars of marketing versus the volume and the accounts that you get that, that relationship has become more favorable or should become much more favorable in terms of leveraging those marketing spends? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. That's a really astute question. The answer is really it's a function, Tim, of how much incremental growth, how fast you try to grow a channel. So let's say that we were spending $10 million a year in a channel and I say, hey guys, I'll let you spend 10% more and you go to $11 million. Well, their productivity will be better next year because their group is aging and the production out of the first $10 million will be much higher next year than this year and they only have kind of $1 million in that example of kind of newbies and stuff. So that would be a much more productive situation. Contrary, if we said, hey, I'll let you increase it 50% from $10 million to $15 million and probably in total, in aggregate, the productivity would be worse next year. So it's a function really, of how steep the investment is. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]  Next question is from the line of Glenn Fodor with Autonomous Research. 
Matt Lipton: It's Matt Lipton in for Glenn. My question is also on the MasterCard product. Could you give us a sense of how much of your volume the MasterCard product represents and where you think this goes -- eventually go? I mean, the product has been growing 30% plus now for a few quarters and just trying to get a sense of how big a part of your business it's becoming? 
Eric R. Dey: We really -- unfortunately, we don't disclose product -- detailed product information like that. We've got a lot of different products in the company and we just don't disclose specific financial information. With all that being said, I mean, it's becoming a very meaningful contributor to our revenue and our bottom line. So it's becoming a pretty big thing. 
Matt Lipton: I mean, the customers that use this, are they completely new to FleetCor or are they people switching between this and the standard FleetCor product? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. In what we would call our direct business where we serve the end customer, the answer is yes, they would be new. And in the case of some of our partner relationships, they would be some new and some converted, right? Some accounts that are on a proprietary oil card might go to a branded universal oil card because they like it better. So it's a mix on the partner side and it's all new on the direct side. 
Matt Lipton: Got it. And then just one housekeeping question. I think you said fall, the Shell contract starts being an economic contributor, so we should just think about that in the fourth quarter? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. The contract's obviously been signed and their plan, the last I spoke to them, is to make a launch announcement, I think, as early as September. So I'd say stay tuned. 
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up from the line of David Togut with Evercore Partners. 
David Togut: Just a quick follow-up. Are you planning to expand the direct MasterCard product internationally and in particularly, to Europe? And does your agreement with Visa on chip card technology, in any way, limit your ability to work with MasterCard, particularly in Europe on a direct MasterCard product? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, David, it's Ron. That's another good question. So no, it's not an exclusive agreement. We could still choose to do something with MasterCard in Europe. There are obviously good friends and supporters here in the States. With that said, I'd say we are way down the road, though, with Visa Europe. Again, having started with them before we even owned AllStar years and then the couple of years that we've been involved, we've been kind of working with them. And then just remade this broader, kind of more ambitious agreement with them because we've been working together. So I'd say that although its nonexclusive, our plan would be, because we've been working with them, to run down the road with them for a while. 
David Togut: So in other words, to introduce a Visa direct product in Europe? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. Again, I'm purposely being evasive there in saying the only thing we're kind of saying for sure today is that we're going to convert this AllStar mag book of business onto this Visa chip so it could obviously work outside of fueling stations, for example and has this chip capability. I'd say other than that, we've got a bunch of products in the kitchen and we want to keep them there until we're closer to launch. So we'll certainly be back to you when it's relevant. 
David Togut: Just a final one then. Is there anything different about the European market that would prevent you from introducing and growing a direct or universal card as you have in the U.S.? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes. There's obviously lots of differences in Europe versus the U.S. Some good things that would make it better and some bad that would make it worse. So for example, bad is it's a quilt, you got all those countries with all different currencies, tax laws, languages, so there's a lot more complexity, right, in launching a card across those markets. On the positive side, there are no universal products there. Unlike the United States, when we launched the MasterCard, there were 2 or 3 companies -- 3, I think, that have had universal cards for 5 or 10 years before us. In Europe, the answer is 0. There's no card like that, that works in Europe. So we like that. So I'd say, if you looked at our cheat sheet, there are some things that are better that make the opportunity better than here and there's some things that make it more difficult than here. 
Operator: And at this time, I'm showing no further questions. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the FleetCor Technologies Incorporated Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. We'd like to thank you very much for your participation. At this time, you may now disconnect.

===== 2013 Q1  (2013-05-02 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to FleetCor Technologies Incorporated first quarter conference call.
 At this time, I’d like to turn the conference over to Eric Dey, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead. 
Eric R. Dey: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. By now everyone should have access to our first quarter press release. It can also be found at www.fleetcor.com under the Investor Relations section.
 Throughout this conference call we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and EBITDA. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than other companies’ similarly titled non-GAAP information.
 Quantitative reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today’s press release and in our website as previously described. Also, we are providing 2013 guidance on a non-GAAP basis.
 Finally, before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements. This includes forward-looking statements about our 2013 guidance, new product and fee initiatives and potential business development and acquisitions.
 They are not guarantees of future performance and therefore, you should not put undue reliance on them. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today’s press release and Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission; others are discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K. These documents are available on our website as previously described and at www.sec.gov.
 With that out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Okay, Eric, thanks. Hi to everyone and thanks for joining today. In my opening here, I'm going to comment on just a couple of things, first Q1 and our 2013 guidance and then second speak a bit about our recently completed deals along with our pipeline.
 So over to Q1, you may have seen our press release from just a bit earlier in which we reported very, very good results, we reported 50% profit growth on $0.90 in cash EPS and 32% revenue growth on a $194 million in revenue, so 32 on top and 50 on the bottom. These numbers we did get some lift from market spreads probably in the range of $3 million to $4 million versus last year. But actually probably only half of that against kind of our normal historical levels.
 In terms of the rest of the environment, I’d say the macro economy, fuel prices and FX were really generally neutral in terms of impact on our numbers. In terms of the various areas of the company, every line of business was up with the exception of check. Our U.S. businesses grew 21%, all organic mostly on the strength of our extended network cards and our CLT business posted a 25% revenue gain for the quarter.
 Internationally, our U.K., Russia and Mexico businesses all grew double digit. And of course, we got additional lift from our newest Russia and Brazil deals, which is a remainder we did not own in Q1 last year. So really very, very solid performance. Our sales performance, sales being new clients, brand new clients that we add and on board in the quarter was really good.
 In the U.S. across all channels, sales were up 36% versus the prior year and Russia up 50% and even our Mexico in Brazil sales were well above our internal plan. So it obviously bodes well when new clients are liking our products.
 But let me now comment just a bit on our newest assets, our 4 newest assets, our newest businesses. Those would be Efectivale in Mexico, AllStar in the U.K., NKT in Russia and CTF in Brazil. So at the combo these 4 newest assets at Q1 pro forma revenue growth that exceeded 35% for the quarter. So the 4 of them collectively grew over 35% for the quarter. And we believe based on what we're working on, it could be literally continued upside throughout this year and in the next. So honestly, really strong new asset performance.
 Let me now transition over to thoughts on full-year guidance. We’re raising full-year cash EPS guidance at the midpoint $0.10, so now to $3.75, that's based on our Q1 beat against guidance and the 2 new Australia and New Zealand deals. We're also raising full-year revenue guidance at the midpoint $15 million, so to $815. And I'd say our confidence in these revised guidance numbers this high, assuming that the key environmental factors stay in place.
 As always, we'd also mention that we could have further upside of the number that would be related to any of these late innings business development deals that we're working on. Let me now shift gears and talk just a bit about our most recently completed acquisitions, so 3 of them. Telenav, which is a mobile tracking company, The GE Fleet Card business in Australia and CardLink, which is our most recent fuel card deal in New Zealand.
 So first on Telenav; Telenav is a mobile tracking company that serves businesses or commercial accounts, basically the same customers that Fleetcor serves. And the Telenav service tracks driver location and also provides a related set of tools aimed at enhancing productivity. But our reason for the acquisition is simple. We want mobile capabilities that help us extend our car programs.
 So beyond plastic and paper, we want to bring mobile features to our fleet operator and drivers and we’re working now on a FleetCor specific application that we would offer back to our existing 500,000 clients. So very, very exciting development for the company.
 Now let me comment on our GE Fleet Card Australia and CardLink acquisitions down under. So what’s interesting is both of these transactions provide us with a universal multi-branded network and those kind of networks are difficult to establish and when you get universal networks, you can create pretty good products. So we expect to be offering market-leading products in both geographies. We think there's tremendous opportunity to grow both of these businesses as both were dramatically underinvested in terms of sales and marketing. There’s obvious synergy between the 2 businesses beyond them being in decent proximity. GE’s business actually uses CardLink’s technology today and we decided to install 1 management team that will run both markets or both businesses for us, so some clear expense synergies.
 As usual, we’ve identified a number of ways to increase profits in those business with ideas to obviously increase revenue longer-term.
 And finally, we think there's some additional opportunity down under, specifically with the major oils. A number of the major oils in the regions are evaluating new ways, new options for running the Fuel Card programs and now that we’ll have operational presence there, we may be a viable alternative for them. So some opportunity there. So lastly, beyond these 3 completed 2013 acquisitions, we are continuing to work on new things, new partner and new acquisition opportunities, some of those are actually nearing decision time. So we will revert if appropriate with any news on that front.
 So in closing, honestly, we’re pleased with the Q1 results and our start to the year. We’re pleased that our newest assets that we’ve acquired are growing fast, 35% for the quarter. I'd say we’re confident about the revised guidance that we provided. We’re excited about these 3 newest deals that we just completed. And we’re optimistic about our prospects to keep developing new partner relationships and winning new acquisitions.
 So with that let me turn the call back over to Eric to provide some additional details on Q1 and on our 2013 guidance. Eric? 
Eric R. Dey: Thanks, Ron. For the first quarter of 2013, we reported revenue of $193.7 million, an increase of 32% from the first quarter of 2012.
 Revenue from our North American segment increased 21% to $100.6 million from $82.8 million in the first quarter of 2012. Revenue from our international segment increased 47% in $93.1 million from $63.4 million in the first quarter of 2012. For the first quarter of 2013, GAAP net income increased 54% to $64.7 million or $0.77 per diluted share from $42.1 million or $0.49 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2012.
 The other financial metrics that we routinely use to measure our business are adjusted revenues and adjusted net income, which we sometimes also refer to as cash net income. Adjusted revenues equal our GAAP revenue less merchant commissions. We use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate the company’s revenue, net of the commissions that are paid to merchants to participate in certain card programs.
 The reconciliations of adjusted revenues and adjusted net income to our GAAP numbers are provided in Exhibit 1 of our press release. Adjusted revenues in the first quarter of 2013 increased 32% to $179.8 million compared to $135.8 million in the first quarter of 2012. Adjusted net income for the first quarter of 2013 increased 48% to $75.2 million or $0.90 per diluted share compared to $50.8 million or $0.60 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2012.
 For the first quarter of 2013, transaction volume increased 3.1% to 74.2 million transactions compared to 72 million transactions in the first quarter of 2012. North American segment transactions grew 4.1% and were all from organic growth. While transactions volumes in our international segment grew 2% and were positively impacted by acquisitions closed in 2012. Adjusted revenue per transaction for the first quarter of 2013 increased 28% to $2.42 from $1.89 in the first quarter of 2012. Adjusted revenue per transaction can vary based on geography, the relevant merchant and customer relationship, the payment product utilized and the types of products or services purchased. A mix of which will be influenced by our acquisitions, organic growth in the business and fluctuations in the macroeconomic environment. When we talk about the macroeconomic environment, we are referring to the impact of market spread margin, fuel prices, foreign exchange rate and the economy in general can have on our business.
 During the first quarter, the decrease in the wholesale cost of fuel resulted in higher fuel spread margin, and although we cannot precisely calculate the impact, this increase has on revenue, we believe it positively impacted our revenues by approximately $3 million. The majority of which was in the North American segment. Changes in foreign exchange rates were mixed and overall had a slightly unfavorable impact on our business during the quarter. And finally, changes in fuel prices were mostly neutral in the U.S. and Europe and we believe had a minimal impact on revenue. Adjusted revenue per transaction for the first quarter was up in both the North American and international segments. Revenue per transaction was up 16.9% in North America due primarily to the positive mix impact of finding of customers which use higher revenue per transaction products than the average. Favorable spread margin and organic revenue growth in most other lines of business.
 In the international segment, revenue per transaction increased 43.9%, which was due primarily to organic revenue growth in most lines of business and acquisitions closed in 2012, which have product that have higher overall revenue per transaction versus our line average.
 Now let’s shift over and discuss some other drivers of our first quarter performance. First our North American segment. Most of our lines of business perform well, resulting in a 21.5% organic revenue growth rate in the quarter versus prior year. Included in the North American segment revenue was a favorable impact from market spread margins, as I mentioned earlier. Some of the other positive drivers of North American revenue during the quarter were similar to last year, and included the continued exceptional performance of our direct market MasterCard product, which had revenue growth of 47% year-over-year.
 The CLC Group provider of lodging management programs continued to perform well and had another solid quarter with 26% revenue growth, over the first quarter of last year. This revenue growth was driven primarily by increases in room nights and our check-in direct product. Results for our international business were positively impacted by 2 acquisitions closed in 2012: CTF in Brazil and MKT in Russia. In addition, our independent fuel card provider based in Russia, PPR, continued to grow with revenues up double-digit over last year, measured in local currency.
 Our U.K. business performed well during the quarter with revenue growing organically by approximately 22% in local currency, driven primarily by the performance of our Allstar business, which was acquired in December of 2011.
 Also, the Mexican prepaid fuel and food business continues to perform well with revenues also up double-digits in local currency. The macroeconomic environment was generally neutral in the International segment during the first quarter and although we cannot precisely calculate the impact of changes in fuel spread and fuel price, we believe they had minimal impact on revenues.
 And finally, the 2 recently announced acquisitions in Australia and New Zealand will have a positive impact on our International segment revenue and profit for the balance of the year.
 To remind everyone in late March, we announced that we acquired Fleet Card, which is a business that includes certain fuel card assets from GE Capital Australia’s custom fleet leasing business. Fleet Card is a multi branded fuel card product with acceptance in over 6000 fuel outlets and over 7000 automotive service and repair centers across Australia.
 Through this transaction, we acquired the Fleet Card product, brand, acceptance network contracts, supplier contracts and approximately 1/3 of the GE customer relationship with regards to fuel cards.
 Also on April 30, we announced that we have acquired CardLink, fuel card issuing and payment processing company based in Auckland, New Zealand. CardLink provides a market leading proprietary fuel card program with virtual universal acceptance at retail fueling stations across New Zealand. The company markets its fuel card directly to mostly small to mid size businesses and provides processing and outsourcing services to oil companies and other partners. 
 Now moving down the income statement. Total operating expenses for the first quarter were $99.4 million compared to $81.7 million in the first quarter of 2012, an increase of 22%. Included in operating expenses are merchant commissions, processing expenses, bad debt, selling and general administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization expense. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to the additional expenses related to acquisitions closed in June and July of 2012.
 As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses decreased to 51.3% of revenue compared to 55.9% in the first quarter of 2012. Credit losses were 9 basis points for the quarter compared to 13 basis points in the first quarter of 2012. The improvement in credit losses was primarily due to improved performance in many business lines and the impact of acquisitions closed in 2012 which have product with historically lower bad debt as a percentage of billed revenue.
 Depreciation and amortization increased 24.8% to $14.6 million in the first quarter of 2013 from $11.7 million in the first quarter of 2012. The increase was primarily due to the impact of amortization of intangible assets related to 2 acquisitions in 2012. Our effective tax decreased to 28.6% compared to 30.2% for the first quarter of 2012. The decrease in the first quarter of 2013 tax rate was due primarily to the reversal of $1.9 million of tax booked in the fourth quarter of 21012, related to the controlled foreign corporation look through exclusion expiring for FleetCor on December 1, 2012.
 The exclusion was retroactively extended in January 2013. However, on December 31, 2012 the retroactive extension had not been passed, so we had book taxes as of December 31, 2012 based on the law in effect at that time before the extension was passed. Since the extension was passed in 2013 we reversed these additional taxes in the first quarter of 2013, which resulted in a lower overall tax rate. Taxes for the remainder of the year should return to historic normal levels.
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $274 million of total cash, $49 million of which is restricted and are primarily customer deposits. The company also has a $500 million accounts receivables securitization faculty. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $385 million borrowed against the facility.
 On February 4, we amended and extended our facility termination date until February 4, 2014. The renewal included a reduction in the facility’s interest rate from CP plus 75 basis points to CP plus 67.5 basis points and also included a reduction in our unused line fee.
 The current purchase limit remains at $500 million. We also had $518 million outstanding on our term loan and $75 million drawn in our revolver. On March 20, we amended our term loan facility to extend the term back to a 5-year term and modified certain provisions of the agreement. The facility was expected to terminate in June 2016 and we have extended to March 2018. We have over $900 million in liquidity to continue our global business development efforts and for general working capital purposes today. As of March 31, our leverage ratio was 1.36x EBITDA compared to 1.57x at the end of the first quarter 2012. Our leverage ratio remains well below our covenant level of 3.25x EBITDA. We intend to use our free cash flow to temporarily pay down the balance on the revolving credit facility and securitization facility and maintain liquidity for acquisitions and other corporate purposes. Finally, we are not a capital intensive business as we spent approximately $4.8 million on CapEx during the first quarter of 2013.
 Now on to our outlook for 2013. Given our favorable results in the first quarter of the year as well as our recently announced acquisitions of fuel card companies in Australia and New Zealand, we are updating our guidance for the remainder of 2013. We now expect revenue to be between $810 million and $820 million, up from our previous guidance range of $790 million to $810 million; adjusted net income to be between $310 million and $320 million, up from our previous guidance range of $300 million to $310 million; and adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $3.70 and $3.80 up from our previous guidance range of $3.61 to $3.69. As a result, our guidance at the adjusted net income per share midpoint of the range of $3.75 represents a 25% growth rate over 2012.
 Our guidance assumptions for the remainder of 2013 are as follows. We expect our 2 recent acquisitions in Australia and New Zealand to be accretive to adjusted net income by approximately $0.04 per diluted share over the remainder of the year. Fuel prices and FX rates at current levels, market spreads equals to the historical average, fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately 84.2 million shares, a full year tax rate of approximately 30.6%, and as always, no impact related to acquisitions or material new partnership agreements that we have not already disclosed.
 And with that said, operator, we’ll open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Phil Stiller with Citi. 
Philip Stiller: I wanted to ask about the U.S. segment, to begin with. You had an acceleration in growth rate sequentially, you talked about CLC and the MasterCard products contributing. Just want to get a sense, I mean you saw a bit of a higher transaction growth rate than what you saw for most of 2012, how much of the recent growth acceleration do you think is sustainable as we look towards the back half of the year? 
Eric R. Dey: Phil, this is Eric, I mean it’s, if you look at our business in North America we have 3 primary business; we’ve got a direct business, a partner business and our hotel, lodging business. All 3 of the businesses continue to grow at better than historical levels, and our growth rate was primarily driven again by our MasterCard product which is up kind of 48% year-over-year and our hotel card product was again up kind of over 20% again. So I think that we're very, very bullish on the continued performance of those products. We need they will continue to perform well over the balance of the year. So we'll kind of see how it goes. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Phil, it's Ron. I would add a couple of things. One I think the grow over was a bit easier in the quarter, the spreads were not great in Q1 of the prior year. So I think that gave us a few points in this quarter. So I would probably guide you to 15% kind of range for the balance of the year. 
Philip Stiller: Okay, it’s helpful. And for CLC in particular what's been driving that growth that's been up for last couple of quarters? 
Ronald F. Clarke: It’s really a lot of things, I mean the small account product I think we have mentioned to you guys continues to tare, I mean that thing is up, way up and I think you know the rate on that is 4 or 5X our large account product, so revenue rose obviously faster than transaction. We got help if you can believe it from the disaster what was it in the fourth quarter Eric last year? 
Eric R. Dey: Yes it was Hurricane Sandy, so we have even a emergency product at CLC and we continue to get some revenue out of that. So I think it added about 1 million of dollars of revenue in the first quarter. We've added more hotels, I would say literally every part Phil, of that business is working. The large accounts that we have there is healthy, they are growing a bit, the small account is going great, I would say all pieces of that business are working. 
Philip Stiller: Okay. Great and last question for me, the international margins spiked up a bit here in the first quarter and were almost equal to your North America margins despite some of the amortization cost you guys have there, I mean how much of that is a reflection of where you are in terms of the synergies that you’re trying abstract from these recent acquisition? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Well, Phil, there was a couple of things kind of drive in the revenue per transaction. I mean, one of the acquisitions themselves meaning CTF and NKT have both higher revenue per transaction products. So the mixed impact of those 2 acquisitions drove up the average. And in addition to that, if you look at that organic growth in the rest of the international segment, I think we were probably up around 20% organically as well. And again driven primarily by our performance in the U.K., performance in our legacy, Russian business, PPR, and both Efectivale and CTF also continue to perform kind of very well, so little bit of everything. 
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Again, I wanted to ask about Australia, just trying to -- I know that Wex [ph] there as well and Ron, you mentioned there is some oil business to be won there, what’s the competitive sort of environment like there and do you have what you need to be competitive in your mind? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, it’s mostly proprietary, Tien-Tsin. It's the same kind of set of players you'd see in Europe. BP is there, Shell is there, Exxon is -- Mobil brand is in New Zealand, Caltex is there and virtually all of those with the exception I think of Mobil are proprietary and so just like continental Europe, they're looking at different weight. So for us having this GFN system, which we can obviously use there and now having the people on the ground, right, that can talk in the same time zone as those clients, we think will be helpful to our prospects there 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Got it. What is sort of the underlying market growth in Australia, I mean do you need to win some of the business to sort of justify the acquisitions? Or is there enough business development that you can do without securing some of the bigger stuff? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I would say, no. I would say there like all, we would rate these being played as somewhat undermanaged. So we think there's like always lots of opportunity initially and then same as the U.S., there’s a big opportunity in the SME segment there. It’s on other kinds of programs not on fuel card programs. So I'd tell you it's 3 things; it's the standard fix the business, its grow the small segment with the universal card and then the upside would be some of these partners. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Okay. You said you talked about the 4 assets growing 35, that’s pretty impressive, obviously. Is there a way to sort of just for us to better understand, is it equal across the 4, I mean there are some that are way outperforming the others. I’m just curious if you are to force rank them, how that would look? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, that’s a good question. I've actually got the page in front of me and what I would add I guess to the earlier commentary is everyone of those 4, the lowest one still grew over 20% this quarter. But remember to make sure you guys are clear, when we get new assets, T-minus 0, our game plan over 12 to 24 months has obviously moved to numbers in the business, so I don’t want to imply that 2 years from today these 4 companies are going to growing organically 35%. What I'm trying to highlight is we're good at acquiring businesses, and we think running them better and so we want to give an actual data point of things that have been acquired in the last year, year and 1 1/2 years, to make it to clear to people that even in recent times, we’re able to do that. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: That’s great. Last 2 quick housekeeping questions and then I’ll jump off. The, I guess international transaction growth in light of some of that commentary there I thought it would have been a little bit higher, was there was some attrition underneath the base that was maybe forced? And the second one is got to ask the question about sort of given the MasterCard growth with the litigation impact would be with the 10-bit pull back around the settlement? 
Eric R. Dey: Tien-Tsin, this is Eric. I’ll answer the second question first. The MasterCard settlement, we’ve estimated the impact of that to be around $2 million over the 10 month period of time. So that'll be spread out over 6 months in 2013 and a little bit in 2014. So from our perspective, it’s fairly immaterial. Moving over to your first question regarding the international transaction growth. Obviously, we’ve got a lot of different businesses across Europe, some of those businesses are performing kind of better than others, some of the businesses are still being impacted by the economy. As an example, our Czech Republic business is still nose down from a business perspective, so still being pretty much impacted by the economy. Our U.K business, I would say the transaction volumes are a little bit down there as well. And then all of the kind of the emerging market businesses, the transaction volumes are mostly kind of up. And when you net it all together that kind of the 2% transaction growth that you see here. 
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs. 
Roman Leal: It’s Roman Leal in for Julio. A few follow-ups to questions that were previously asked. First in North America, can you actually, can you help us -- tell us maybe what percentage of the North America revenue comes from CLC today. It feels like that’s obviously a big contributor to not only the growth but the revenue per transaction there. 
Eric R. Dey: Roman, this is Eric. Unfortunately we don’t disclose the revenue of individual business lines, because we have quite a few of them around the world. I would say of the 3 big businesses we have in United States, meaning the direct business, the partner business and the CLC business; that business would be the smaller of the 3. Just you have from a kind of an econ [ph] size prospective but again we don’t specifically disclose revenue. 
Roman Leal: Okay. And then maybe the second half of that is how would you describe the, how would you tare the revenue per transaction in CLC versus the other 2 major channels there? 
Eric R. Dey: If we had a look at CLC, it’s going to have higher venue per tran than all of the other businesses and it's just because of the nature of what the product is. So of the 3 businesses in the U.S. again, that would be the highest revenue per tran business, probably followed by the direct business and then the partner business. 
Roman Leal: Got it. That’s actually helpful. And in international, I guess we're always trying to reset the bar there and try to figure out what’s the normal level of revenue per transaction there? Maybe these 2 new acquisitions that seem to have really move the needle for you this quarter. How much of the average international revenue per transaction, are those 2 acquisitions? 
Eric R. Dey: There's kind of 2 different businesses there. Our CTF business in Brazil is kind of higher, I would say it’s not dramatically higher than where the average ended up for the quarter. Our NKT business historically is a different kind of business, because historically it was a business that earned revenue based on the sale of cards and the sale of software. So the transaction count there is a little bit lower and it's a little bit more kind of lumpy, but it is kind of higher than the average and it's based on just happens to be what gets purchased in the quarter. But it, both of those are higher than the average. 
Roman Leal: Okay. And last one just to a follow-up to Tien-Tsin’s question on-- in U.K. you said maybe transactions growth was a little south there or modest, but Allstar revenue growth was pretty strong so was there something like pricing or anything else called out there. 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, Roman, it's Ron. We introduced some price on some segments of the market in Allstar and we also managed through a pretty bumpy conversion in the first quarter. So both of those things moved volume down a bit, and I think our question is it temporary or is it longer term, but I’d say that business still performed well. So it's not -- you don't see it in the Q1 numbers, but we did bump through some conversion issues with accounts, which wasn’t great and we like always are testing pricing in some areas. 
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays Capital. 
Adam Carron: This is actually Adam Carron filling in for Darrin. Just a quick question in North America to start, you mentioned that sales during the quarter were up somewhere around 36% or so in the U.S. specifically, I mean when we think about the sales, is it -- I know you guys have traditionally said it's being about 50-50 between the exceeded network cards versus the traditional cards, I mean is that kind of the mix that you saw during the quarter as well? 
Ronald F. Clarke: It's Ron. I mean the main reasons the U.S. sales are up are, we’re were spending more, like we said to invest in growth we had a higher spend in the quarter and then b, we're getting more productivity. Some of the new channels like our telesales group is aging, so their producing more for the same dollars. So the first thing I would say is that thing is up really, because of investment and productivity. I’d say again we don’t disclose the mix, but that's not far off. We still sell some fair amount of our proprietary products. So I think 50/50 is a fair estimate. 
Adam Carron: That’s helpful. And then, secondly you mentioned that you could see some upside to the 35% growth from these 4 acquisitions that you saw here in the first quarter and maybe you could provide a little bit more clarity in terms of what types of synergies you could recognize to help get you there. And I think one of the things may be from Allstar, given the fact that you did have to wait for OFT clearance to start kind of recognizing a lot of the synergies. Maybe we could also get a better understanding in terms of where you're at in terms of what inning you are at, recognizing the synergies from each of those acquisitions? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, what I’d like to make clear is, there's a big difference between point-to-point or grow over versus sequential. So when I comment about," "hey these 4 deals have more juice" so those 4 deals have revenue of x in Q1. What I'm trying to convey is that Q2, Q3, Q4 and next year, we believe the revenues, the absolute revenue in each of those businesses will keep rising. Again be careful on the grow over because we've moved those upper lot, since we’ve owned them and so we are going to lap a place there where we're not going to have that kind of growth in those 4 new assets. So let me make that point first. But I’d say that the answer is on every one of these new deals we do kind of the quick fix work in the first 6 to 12 months. And now the stuff that will be added that were kind of new products or new channel ideas. So I think I mentioned we’ve got a new universal product in Mexico. And we’ve introduced telesales there that they never had before. I think we built that up a lot. And Allstar we had 0 people in telesales. We built that team to, I think, 20 to 25 people now over the last 6 months. We’ve got some new partner conversations going on in one of the businesses. So I’d say that in every situation, there were things happening that we believe can cause the revenue and each of those businesses to increase on a sequential basis. But again, not 35% because we’ll have lap of the early improvements as we get into the latter half of the year. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of David Togut with Evercore Partners. 
David Togut: Just starting off, what was the organic international transaction growth in the quarter? 
Eric R. Dey: No, the organic grow, growth for the transactions isn't in there for internationally. The revenue grew organically just over 20%, but I don’t have the exact number for the transactions in front of me, David. 
David Togut: Got you. Can you, well can you ballpark for us, maybe give us a range of what the revenue per trans growth was organically international? 
Eric R. Dey: Again it would be probably in lined with the amount of the revenue organic growth, so there were 2 things that happened internationally during the quarter. One is obviously we bought 2 acquisitions that have higher than the average revenue per transaction, so there is a favorable mix impact associated with adding those 2 businesses in. And then the remainder was driven by a 20% kind of organic growth in the international segment. So around 20% is that -- would be the answer from an organic perspective. 
David Togut: Got it. And then on the direct MasterCard another high 40-s revenue growth quarter for you. What types of growth rates are sustainable for this product over the next 12 to 24 months? 
Ronald F. Clarke: David its Ron, I think again the answer is just literally a function of what we want to spend. so the reason again that product is growing at those rates is a relationship between the sales, right -- the amount of new sales we’re selling. Your earlier question to size of the base, and because we’ve increased our sales investment and from my comments on sales we’re producing more total sales, as long as we continue to increase investment relative to that base, we think it is a 30%, 40% grower for awhile. There's no limit on the market again and the interest in the product. It’s really just a marketing and reach in investment question from our perspective. 
David Togut: That helps. You reference in your comments Ron partnerships you are working on acquisitions; do these skew more towards mature market or emerging markets? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Emerging. 
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Glenn Fodor with Autonomous. 
Glenn Fodor: Just going back to what is your first points about the sales performances. U.S. was up 36%, and Russia was up 50%, just, pardon my ignorance, but what is this metric is this expected revenues over the next 2 year from clients you won this quarter, what exactly is this? 
Ronald F. Clarke: It's Ron. Glenn, that's a good question. So basically we run a metric alongside of revenue that we call sales in the company and the methodology, the calculation is; if you sign up let’s say Ron's Plumbing on January 1. We basically look at that account over 1 month and decide okay what’s Ron's Plumbing going to produce in the 12 month period for January 1 to December 31. And if we're wrong 13 weeks later we adjust it, if it’s running higher or lower. So we basically create pretty accurate estimates of every new account what it's going to produce on the 12 month basis. So it’s a proxy really for annual revenue of the accounts. 
Glenn Fodor: So that’s helpful. And then so, we in these metrics of 36 and 50 just for frame of reference, what were those for the similar calculation what you would have posted in the fourth quarter, I don’t know if you disclosed it. But do you have that? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, I unfortunately don’t have it but I would say that we grew sales clearly double-digit Glenn last year and again it’s really a function of investment. The reason I wanted to call it out is I wanted to again make this point about the maturity or lack thereof our business and our products and make the point that when you sell a bunch and you sell more than you did before obviously there's an interest in your product line and so we thought disclosing this would be again, just another indicator to people listening that, we have a product line that people want and it’s being reflected in the amount of new business that’s been added. And as you guys model things, that obviously rolls into revenue right the more we sell, obviously that'll move forward revenue rates, so that was the message. 
Glenn Fodor: That’s great color to have. Just an extension of David’s question, I mean I know you don’t have in front of you the organic transaction growth. But this 2% for the quarter, I mean, how does that feel to you versus just without putting it down to exact numbers. How does that feel versus where it has been again x-acquisitions for the last couple of years. And then how do you expect this, excluding acquisitions how should we expect it to trend for the rest of the year, is this 2% about where it should be again x-acquisitions for the rest of 2013? 
Ronald F. Clarke: Yes, to not sound trite, I mean the problem is I'd say it feels irrelevant. Again, the metrics we look at are the growth rate again in the businesses that we are trying to grow. And as I repeatedly say, we're growing those much, much faster. And so the problem with the averages that are quoted is, it’s not how we run the company or look at the company. And so what I'd say again is of the products in the businesses that we’re investing in, they're all growing double-digit. And we track revenue, we’re trying to focus on organic revenue growth. So I'd say that the only way we could get at that is if we were to unbundle for you all of various product lines and show you that the ones that have higher revenue per tran and that we’re interested in, and we’re spending behind are growing much, much faster than the couple of percent. And again that’s what’s driving, it’s not pricing, it’s what’s driving again the revenue growth being much higher than the tran growth, it’s the businesses that are more attractive growing at much, much faster rates. 
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes FleetCor Technologies Incorporated First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2012 Q4  (2013-02-07 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to FleetCor Technologies Incorporated fourth quarter conference call.
 At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Eric Dey, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead. 
Eric Dey: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. By now everyone should have access to our fourth quarter and full year 2012 press release. It can also be found at www.fleetcor.com under the Investor Relations section.
 Throughout this conference call we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and EBITDA. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than other companies’ similarly titled non-GAAP information.
 Quantitative reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today’s press release and on our website as previously described. Also, we are providing 2013 guidance on a non-GAAP basis.
 Finally, before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements. This includes forward-looking statements about our 2013 guidance, new product and key initiatives and potential business development and acquisition. They are not guarantees of future performance and therefore you should not put any undue reliance on them.
 These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today’s press release and Form 8-K filed with the Security and Exchange Commission. Others are discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. These documents are available on our website as previously described and at www.sec.gov.
 With that out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. 
Ronald Clarke: Eric, thanks. Hello everyone. As always appreciate you joining the call today. In my opening remarks, I am going to comment a bit on our Q4 results, discuss some of our highlights from 2012 and then I will close with speaking a bit about our outlook for 2013.
 So first off let me turn to the results for the quarter. The Q4 results we just reported were very, very good and up significantly versus Q4 last year. We reported Q4 revenue of $202 million, up 45% and cash EPS of $0.82, up 46%. So basically mid-40s top and bottom for the quarter.
 EBITDA reached $108 million for the quarter and at the high level this Q4 performance was really driven by 2 things. So first, a full quarter of our 3 newest acquisitions, AllStar in the U.K., NKT in Russia and CTF in Brazil. And second, every other major line of business in the company except for our check business grew revenue 14% or more in the quarter. That's 14% or more in Q4. So obviously our core businesses are very, very healthy in their own right.
 So let me comment on the reasons that these lines of business grew at this rate. So starting off in the U.S., our U.S. direct business grew double-digit because the MasterCard product volume grew 27% in the quarter, so that product continues to perform. Our U.S. partner business grew on the continued strength of the universal co-branded offering still doing great, and we got some additional lift in our CLC hotel card business from added emergency room nights in Q4 related to hurricane Sandy.
 In Europe, our legacy U.K. businesses, those we’ve owned prior to AllStar both turned around in Q4 and both grew double-digits mostly as a result of stronger volume. And finally, our Mexico revenue grew over 25%.IIt was driven by higher merchant pricing and a continued mix shift to the higher-margin fuel card business versus the food card business. So basically the Q4 was a combination of the 3 new acquisitions, a full quarter of those and then really terrific 14% plus revenue growth in the rest of our businesses.
 So let me now transition over to our full year 2012 results. So for full year ‘12 we reported revenue over $700 million which was up 36% and cash EPS of $2.99, which is up 38%. So the major highlights for ‘12 included first, 14% revenue growth in our U.S. businesses for the full year, all organic. So again a very healthy here in the U.S. We completed 2 new acquisitions, one in Brazil and one in Russia. We went live with Shell in Asia, the first market helped improve out our GSM system credibility. We turned around 2 of our existing U.K. businesses, so they are pointing in the right direction.
 We reorganized and strengthened our business development capability to chase even more deals and more places. And alongside that upsized our credit facility to create about $1 billion in liquidity to fund new deals. We turned 20 million shares into public float as our PE investors reduced their shareholdings and finally, FLT led the processing category of stocks returning 76% for 2012. So all in all a really, really terrific year for FleetCor.
 And now it’s time to shift over and talk a little bit about 2013 and our overall outlook. So at the midpoint today we’re providing 2013 guidance of $800 million in revenue with almost 50% of that now outside of the U.S. and $3.65 in cash EPS. So that $3.65 reflects about a 22% profit growth target.
 So let me speak a bit about the bridge that takes us from $2.99 cash EPS in ‘12 to $3.65 in cash EPS for ‘13. So first, about half of this anticipated earnings increases already in our run rate or exit rate. So our Q3 and Q4 cash EPS was in the low 80s, so that alone gets us approximately halfway to our $3.65 target.
 Second, we’re implementing a number of new product initiatives that will create incremental growth. For example, the U.S. we've launched a new cobranded heavy-truck card that will help us better target our mixed fleets. We've launched a new diesel card for one of our major oil partners that provide an extended diesel network that will give us incremental volume, and we’ve launched the universal fuel card in Mexico, with some selected discounts back at our proprietary network. So a really attractive offer there.
 Third, our new assets, we expect to generate additional profit dollars from our 4 newest businesses. So some of those initiatives we’re introducing a new extended network convenience fee in our U.K. business. We’re transitioning to a per trend pricing model from a traditional license pricing model in Russia. In Brazil we expect to get paid for administering millions of dollars of special local merchant discounts for our clients, which we really had historically managed for free. And in Mexico, we’re getting paid more from our fuel merchants as those discount levels are now getting in line with general-purpose credit cards in that market. So really all of these initiatives should contribute to higher revenue per tran in our new assets in 2013.
 And then lastly in terms of the bridge, we believe we’ve got some meaningful upside in our global business development pipeline. We’ve got a number of partnership proposals that are finally maturing and which we expect 2013 decisions. We've also got a very developed acquisition pipeline, which we expect will convert into some real business this year. So the combination of run rate, new products, improved performance in our new assets and global BD should drive our results for 2013.
 So in closing, I’d say again we’re very pleased with our finish to 2012. We’re optimistic about our prospects for 2013 and I think you know that we will give it our all to try to deliver this guidance this year. So with that, let me turn the call back over to Eric to provide some additional details on our Q4 results and on our 2013 guidance. Eric? 
Eric Dey: Thanks, Ron. For the fourth quarter of 2012 we reported revenue of $202.6 million, an increase of 45% from the fourth quarter of 2011. Revenue from our North American segment increased 19% to $108.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 from $91.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. And revenue from our international segment increased 93% to $94 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 from $48.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2011.
 For the fourth quarter of 2012 GAAP net income increased 59% to $60.1 million or $0.70 per diluted share from $37.8 million or $0.45 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2011. The other financial metrics that we routinely use to measure our business are adjusted revenues and adjusted net income, which we sometimes also refer to as cash net income.
 Adjusted revenues equal our GAAP revenues less merchant commission. We use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate the company's revenues net of the commissions that are paid to merchant to participate in certain card programs. Commissions paid to merchants can vary when market spreads fluctuate in much the same way some of our revenue can fluctuate when market spreads vary. For this reason we believe the adjusted revenue financial metric is a more effective way to evaluate the company's performance.
 Adjusted net income is GAAP net income adjusted to eliminate non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to share-based compensation award, amortization of deferred financing costs and intangible assets, amortization of the premium recognized in the purchase of receivables, a loss on early extinguishment of debt and adjusted for the income tax effect of such items. The reconciliation of adjusted revenues and adjusted net income to our GAAP numbers are provided in exhibit one of our press release.
 Adjusted revenues in the fourth quarter of 2012 increased 47% to $185 million compared to $125.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2012 increased 49% to $70.7 million $0.82 per diluted share, compared to $47.3 million $0.56 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2011.
 For the fourth quarter of 2012 transaction volume increased 23% to 78 million transactions compared to 64 million transactions in the fourth quarter of 2011. North American segment transactions were all from organic growth while transaction volumes in the international segment were positively impacted by an acquisition closed in the fourth quarter of 2011 and 2 acquisitions closed in June and July of 2012. To remind everyone in December of 2011, we acquired AllStar business solutions, a leading U.K. fuel card company. In mid-June of 2012 we completed the acquisition of NKP in Russia and in July of 2012 we expanded into the Brazilian market with our acquisition of CTF Technologies.
 Adjusted revenue per transaction for the fourth quarter of 2012 increased 20% to $2.36 from $1.87 in the fourth quarter of 2011. Adjusted revenue per transaction can vary based on geography, the relevant merchant customer relationship, the payment product utilized and the types of products or services purchased, a mix of which will be influenced by our acquisition, organic growth in the business and fluctuations in macroeconomic environment. When we talk about the macroeconomic environment we are referring to the impact of market spread margin, fuel prices, foreign exchange rate and the economy in general can have on our business.
 During the fourth quarter the decrease in the wholesale cost of fuel resulted in higher fuel spread margin, which we believe positively impacted our revenues by approximately $1 million to $2 million. Changes in foreign-exchange rate had a minimal impact on our business during the quarter. And finally fuel prices were up slightly in the U.S. and Europe, and we believe added approximately $1 million to revenue.
 Adjusted revenue per transaction for the quarter was positively impacted by organic growth in most of our payment programs. In addition, the impact of acquisitions closed in the fourth quarter of 2011 and in 2012 had a slightly favorable impact on adjusted revenue per transaction as some of these businesses have higher per transaction revenue product versus our line average.
 Now let’s shift over and discuss some of the drivers of the fourth quarter performance. First, in our North American segment, all of our lines of businesses performed well resulting in an 18% organic growth rate in the quarter versus prior year at the adjusted revenues line. Included in the North American segment revenue was a slightly favorable impact from the macroeconomic environment. Fuel price spreads were favorable. During the quarter the wholesale cost of fuel fell at a faster rate than the retail price of fuel which increased fuel price spread margin and which we believe positively impacted our revenue by approximately $1 million.
 Fuel prices were up slightly versus last year in the U.S. but had very little impact on the quarter. Some of the other positive drivers of North American revenue during the quarter included the continued exceptional performance of our direct market MasterCard product which had revenue growth of 48% year-over-year. The CLC Group, provider of lodging management programs continued to perform well and had another solid quarter with 20% revenue growth over the fourth quarter of last year. Included in the fourth quarter CLC revenue numbers was additional revenue from incremental hotel rooms booked related to Hurricane Sandy.
 Results for our international business were positively impacted by the AllStar acquisition which closed during the fourth quarter of 2011 and the 2 acquisitions closed in 2012, CTF in Brazil and NKP in Russia. In addition, our independent fuel card provider based in Russia PPR continued to grow with revenue up double digit over last year in local currency. Our legacy UK businesses, excluding AllStar, turned around in Q4 with both of our businesses reporting double-digit growth rates due to stronger volume.
 Also, the Mexican prepaid fuel and food card portion of our business continues to perform well with revenues up double digits in local currency. And finally, the macroeconomic environment was generally favorable during the fourth quarter and although we cannot precisely calculate the impact, we believe it positively impacted our revenues by approximately $1 million to $2 million.
 Now moving down the income statement. Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $109.5 million compared to $85.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, an increase of 27%. Included in operating expenses are merchant commissions, processing expenses, bad debt, selling and general administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expense. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to additional expenses related to acquisitions closed prior to the fourth quarter of 2012.
 Included in operating expenses for the quarter was $5 million of non-cash stock compensation expense versus $5.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. As a percentage of total revenue, operating expenses decreased to 54% compared to 61% in the fourth quarter of 2011. Credit losses were 13 basis points for the quarter compared to 20 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2011. The improvement in credit losses was primarily due to improvement in the economy and the impact of acquisitions closed in 2011 and 2012 which had product with lower bad debt as a percentage of billed revenue.
 Depreciation and amortization increased 52% to $15.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 from $9.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. The increase was primarily due to the impact of amortization of intangible assets related to our acquisition of AllStar in the fourth quarter of 2011, the acquisition in Russia in June of 2012 and the acquisition in Brazil in July of 2012.
 Our effective tax rate increased to 32.6% of pretax income compared to 25.6% for the fourth quarter of 2011. The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily impacted by 2 items. First, an increase in taxes of $1.9 million, due to the impact of the controlled foreign corporation look-through exclusion expiring for FleetCor on December 1, 2012. The exclusion was retroactively extended in January 2013. However, on December 31, 2012 the retroactive extension had not been passed. So we have to book taxes as of December 31, 2012 based on the law in effect on December 31, 2012 before the extension was passed.
 This extension was passed in 2013. We will reverse these additional taxes in the first quarter of 2013, which will result in a lower overall tax rate in the first quarter. The impact of this item on our per share amounts was $0.02. If we had not booked the additional $1.9 million of taxes, our adjusted net income per share in the fourth quarter would have been $0.84 per share versus the reported $0.82 per share.
 Second, the much lower rate in the fourth quarter of 2011 was due to the positive impact of retroactive adjustments related to tax planning successfully implemented in foreign jurisdictions where we do business and a reduction in the statutory rate in foreign jurisdictions where we do business.
 Now turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $337 million of total cash, $53.7 million of which is restricted and are primarily customer deposits. The company also had a $500 million accounts receivable securitization facility. At the end of the quarter we had approximately $298 million borrowed against the facility and have the ability to draw an additional $14 million based on eligible receivables pledged against the facility.
 We also had $525 million outstanding in our term loan and $100 million drawn on our revolver. We have nearly $1 billion in liquidity to continue our global business development efforts and for general working capital purposes today. As of December 31, our leverage ratio was 1.57 times EBITDA compared to 1.34 times at the end of the third quarter. The increase in the covenant level was primarily due to the additional borrowing to help fund the share buyback in the fourth quarter. Our leverage ratio remains well above our covenant level of 3.25 times EBITDA. The company intends to use its free cash flow to temporarily pay down the balance on our revolving credit facility and securitization facility and maintain liquidity for acquisitions and other corporate purposes.
 Finally, we are not a capital intensive business as we spent approximately $5.5 million on CapEx during the fourth quarter of 2012 and $19.1 million for the full year of 2012.
 Now on to our outlook for 2013. For 2013 we’re providing our guidance for revenue to be between $790 million and $810, adjusted net income to be between $300 million and $310 million and adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $3.61 and $3.69. As a result, our guidance at the adjusted net income per share midpoint of the range of $3.65 represents a 22% growth rate over 2012. Some of the assumptions that we have made in preparing this guidance included the following: fuel prices equal to the 2012 average, market spread equal to the 2012 average, foreign exchange rate equal to the 2012 average.
 We are also assuming a slight increase in our effective tax rate from 30.4% in 2012 to 30.6% in 2013. We are also assuming fully diluted shares outstanding of 84.5 million shares, a 1.2 million share decrease from 2012 due primarily to the company share buyback in December of 2012. And as always, no impact related to future acquisitions or material new partnership agreements.
 For those of you that are looking for guidance for the first quarter, I want to remind everyone that our business has some seasonality and that typically the first and fourth quarters are lower than the second and third quarters in both revenue and profit. In this year in particular, the seasonality is magnified in the first quarter due to Christmas being celebrated in January in Russia and 2 factors in Brazil where most businesses are on summer break and also Carnival celebrations is in January as well.
 As a reminder, we did not own NKP in Russia and TCF in Brazil in the first quarter of 2012. With that said we are expecting our first quarter adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $0.82 and $0.86. This guidance includes lower income tax expense due to the reversal of the $1.9 million in incremental tax expense booked in the fourth quarter of 2012 as I explained earlier. As a result, our first-quarter tax rate is expected to be lower than the remaining quarters of 2013. We have no plans to provide quarterly guidance going forward but rather to update our annual guidance each quarter.
 And with that said, operator, we will open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: It’s great results and it’s a very strong outlook here. Just to dig into the outlook and the 13% revenue growth, can you break that down for us in terms of organic versus inorganic? 
Eric Dey: The organic growth rates are effectively in line with the guidance that we previously had given. So we kind of guide people to around 10% number each year. So we believe our organic rates are in line with that. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Okay, so no change there. And then similarly just thinking about for modeling purposes I know it’s really tough to be precise here. But just thinking about transaction growth and revenue per tran for the year, any callouts for us to consider as we layer that into the model? 
Eric Dey: Yes we haven’t provided any guidance on that, Tien-Tsin but it should be consistent with kind of the growth rate we experienced in the last couple of years. 
Ronald Clarke: Hey Tien-Tsin, it’s Ron. I would say that because we’ve got a number of new assets, rolling into ‘13 that we’re expecting higher revenue per tran in those particular assets. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: So this Q had a little bit more towards that - okay will do that. And then just last one and then I will let others ask, just Ron, you mentioned acquisition pipeline, partner deals pretty high, just curious about the acquisition pipeline, how has that changed, it’s the last time you spoke publicly and curious as to the size and quality of the things you’re going after, is it similar to what you actually closed in 2002 or should we look for something different? 
Ronald Clarke: I guess 2 comments. I’d say on both the deal side and the partner side the difference is I think they both are little more mature or more developed. I think we've progressed farther in terms of getting to the end of those. And in terms of the deal portfolio, I think it’s like - it’s a mix, we’ve got stuff in a variety of places and we’ve got some stuff that’s pretty big and we’ve got some stuff that’s not so big. So I would say across the set it’s a mixed engine. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs. 
Julio Quinteros: Two quick ones, First the 14% number that you guys cited, was that all organic growth for the fourth quarter? 
Eric Dey: It was, Julio. It’s all organic growth. 
Julio Quinteros: And then secondly, looking at the conversion between the revenue per transaction on the international side and the North America side, and that's a pretty dramatic shift in terms of how close you look now only about 30% -- $0.03 spread between those 2, how sustainable is that as we think about kind of the outlook for 2013 in terms of the run rate and the revenue per transaction side relative to the international business here? 
Eric Dey: Every time we do acquisitions, we effectively kind of reset the bar. So included in the revenue per tran in the international numbers are CTF and NKT which were obviously acquisitions that we closed in the middle of the year. So the run rate that we’re experiencing kind of at the end of the year is the new run rate. 
Ronald Clarke: Julio, it’s Ron, I’d just add a couple things. So one, the international you will see better revenue per tran in ‘13 in that segments of the regions that I mentioned earlier, to sell a bunch of assets in that international group and I tried to give a little flavor of what we're doing to kind of move that up. You should see a better number next year, this year. The related one was just Shell, just going to comment on Shell, as we start to pour those transactions into our transaction count, that obviously is something that we take the international number the other way. We will again call it out for you but that would be the one -- one thing that we’d take the revenue per tran in the opposite direction. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Glenn Fodor with Autonomous Research. 
Glenn Fodor: VeriFone had said they’re investing in re-terminalizing station owners with new acceptance methods that are little more sophisticated. Just wondering if you can opine for a little bit on what you think about the implications for your company, as technology changes at the pump,. 
Ronald Clarke: Are you talking Glenn, here in the States or are you talking in Europe or where? 
Glenn Fodor: In the states. 
Ronald Clarke: Until I guess the thing gets to the chip and pin like it is in Europe, I’d say it’s probably not much changed for us. So really until kind of the card format changes we would have to go through a card conversion I’d say it’s not very important to us. 
Glenn Fodor: So the worries of increased investment costs to keep pace with technology not really is an issue here. 
Ronald Clarke: I guess for us we obviously run card no matter what’s at the point of sale. The only thing that would really affect our business would really be a technology change from magstripe to chip and pin that would cause us basically they have to cycle out those cards. 
Glenn Fodor: We are facing chip and pin at some point, so have you couched at all or have you -- what kind of cost that you’re going to have to incur because it is inevitable at some point? 
Ronald Clarke: Again it’s not much for us, it’s really all in the cad because we’ve obviously got that capability inside of our platforms, as our platforms obviously run in Europe as well. So I would say it’s low single-digit millions kind of a number. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore Partners. 
David Togut: Growth in North American revenue per transaction more than doubled to 13% year-over-year in the fourth quarter from 6% in the third. You mentioned the additional emergency rooms for CLC because of hurricane Sandy but can you walk through some of the underlying drivers of that acceleration in revenue per trans in North America and to what extent do think that’s sustainable in ’13? 
Eric Dey: David, again from a guidance perspective we kind of guide people to, from an organic perspective that we’re going to grow our revenue at around 10% organically. And as Ron indicated earlier going into 2013 it will probably be a little more skewed in the international side because of some of the acquisitions that we completed. Certainly we’re going to continue to grow the U.S. business at a very healthy kind of organic growth rate but we really haven’t provided guidance specifically for each of the 2 segments. So I would kind of think about it as a whole, as again FleetCor being around 10% organic growth business. And for a lot of factors that Ron called out in this section of the call. 
Ronald Clarke: Just another add, David, a couple other things to help in the U.S., so one, we introduced some add-on reporting features in the second half of the year that kind of hit that got booked, later in the year they gave us probably a couple of points of lift. And b, we finished from a sales perspective really strong and so I think our volume was a little stronger in the fourth quarter than we had planned, gave us another, call it, point or 2. So I would say that we picked up 3 or 4 points for those regions and probably again to Eric’s point, you guys should think about 10% going forward. 
David Togut: On the MasterCard direct product 48% revenue growth in the fourth quarter, in what inning are you in terms of converting the private label books of business over to MasterCard and how long is the runway for growth in that business? 
Ronald Clarke: So again, those are 2 separate things, you said though, again our direct business - when we refer to the direct business, that’s a end fleet. So they run plumbing company where we go out directly to the end client. That’s the business that Eric related it’s growing up 48%. The partner business where we have co-branded offerings with big oil partners, I’d say that business is probably its seventh-inning in terms of conversion. When I say direct business, we are in the second or third inning still. 
David Togut: Can you maybe give us a sense in terms of how big the driver of the direct business was versus the cobrand business in terms of driving revenue per transaction up in the quarter? 
Eric Dey: They were both pretty significant drivers, in our direct business although we don't again specifically call out numbers for those various products, our direct card business was helped by spreads during the quarter. So we believe we had $1 million in kind of unusual favorability or one-time favorability because of higher than normal spread. So that was helpful during the quarter and again just increased sales in those 2 products, and those products have higher than kind of line average revenue per trans. So both of those factors kind of drove the growth in the quarter. 
Ronald Clarke: But we did disclose David, again just so you know, both of those businesses had grown 14% or more, so that they obviously were both growing. 
Eric Dey: Correct, there was booked volume and revenue per tran. 
David Togut: Quick final question from me, does your 2013 outlook include possible merchant litigation settlement being finalized between MasterCard, Visa, the issuers and the merchants and the 10 basis point interchange cut that they've offered up? 
Eric Dey: Yes David, I mean effectively that 10 basis point settlement for us is basically immaterial. And half of it will be spread over 2013 and half of it over 2014. So effectively - and we don’t specifically budget for it but again it’s just not a material number for us. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Phil Stiller with Citigroup. 
Philip Stiller: I guess my first question on the international side you guys had roughly $9 million sequential increase in revenue. Just wondering if you could provide some more color on that, how much was related to some seasonality related to the 2 acquisitions that you have, how much was related to some of the new product and pricing adjustments you guys talked about? 
Eric Dey: Hey Phil, this is Eric. Actually it’s a little bit of both. Obviously we cleared the OFT and AllStar in the middle of the year. We’ve obviously started operating some of the other businesses we acquired, I mean CTF and NKP as an example. So we are starting to operate those businesses and as you would expect we’re starting to improve the performance of those businesses. So it’s a little bit of both. So our existing businesses are performing well and we’re starting to increase the revenue and the performance of those other businesses we acquired, so it’s both. 
Ronald Clarke: The other thing, Phil, is the 2 businesses that we called out the Brazil business and the Russia business, strangely the fourth quarter is actually the strongest quarter for those 2 businesses because their holidays basically fall in this quarter in Q1. So unlike a lot of the other lines of business in the company where the fourth quarter is softer, those 2 are every year significantly better in Q4. 
Philip Stiller: In terms of your plans to extract the accretion from these deals that you completed over the past 18 months, and where would you guys say you are in terms of that progression? Are we at the full run rate of some of these product pricing adjustments in the fourth quarter or is more to come? And then I know you guys talked about some platform consolidation on the AllStar business in the past, where is that progressing? 
Ronald Clarke: I would say the headline is much more to come. So like always we do the state work on these things in terms of confirming our facts and testing reaction to these changes and in some cases like in Mexico we’ve got to go out to 500 merchants to get them to market in terms of rates, so that process can take months. So I would say we’ve got a little bit of that kind of exiting ’12 but much, much more to come in 2013. 
Philip Stiller: Just last question on the acquisition pipeline, can you talk about competition you guys are seeing? I know there has been a few deals in the space you guys haven’t been involved over the past 6 to 12 months. As a product of your success, are you seeing more competition on those acquisitions and valuations are becoming more expensive, how do you guys think about that? 
Ronald Clarke: I think it falls, Phil, really into 2 buckets. I think where deals shopped, the answer is yes, but I think there is more people that like our space now and more people that have money, so it caused us probably to pay more and we still have obviously deals that we kind of sole source where we build relationships and have, we think, a good home for the target. And so in those cases I’d say we are paying what I’d call reasonable prices. And I’d say sitting in our inventory today, we have both of those flavors. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Willi with Wells Fargo. 
Timothy Willi: I had 2 questions. First in the North America, could you - if you made the comment, I apologize but could you talk about what you saw sort of same customer level, just sort of your sense around organic activity of your customers or new business formations, anything along those lines that you saw in the quarter that’s worth calling out? 
Ronald Clarke: Tim, it’s Ron. I’d say no real news there, it’s really still flat. We got really 0 help in Q4 what we call same-store volume. So again our growth comes from having either, a, more clients and more trans than we had before, or b, having them on product that we enjoy more revenue, no lift basically from them growing. 
Timothy Willi: As a follow up to that, your comments around the direct MasterCard, I think you said a 48% growth. What percentage of new direct sales are the MasterCard product, is that pretty much the only product that's being managed from new direct customers now? 
Ronald Clarke: Yes I’d say without getting into too specific, it is probably around ballpark half our U.S. sales, so the answer is no. We still sell a fair amount of our proprietary products, they appeal to different segments of the market. So we still sell both. I think the new news of why the U.S. business is growing faster the last couple of years is that the new product appeals to a new segment that we couldn’t historically sell. Like selling minivans versus sports cars, right, you bring different people into the market and then b) we’ve got a number of new channels working, I think I mentioned our Telematics partnership contributed 10% of the U.S. sales in 2012 and that channel didn’t exist 2 years ago. And so it’s a combo of the product opening up a new market and us expanding and investing more in the channels just allows us to basically grow faster now. 
Timothy Willi: My last question and I will hop off. The U.K., you talked about volume keeping up, is that something you're doing on market share or specific to the work with AllStar as compared to something at a macro level because I guess the macro news that we’re seeing here, wouldn't support any notable uptick in economic activity. I’d be curious what you attribute that reacceleration to? 
Ronald Clarke: That’s another really good question. So again the comments that we made deal with the legacy businesses we have in the U.K.. So those grew 14% or more without AllStar, so leave AllStar out. So the short answer to why those businesses are healthier and turned the corner is mostly about the market. So those 2 products are what we call spread based products, their appeal to the market is attractive pricing and our pricing is attractive when we have more spread to work with. So let’s say there was a dime of spread, we might be able to give customers couple of cents off and still make some money versus if spreads were $0.04, we can’t really give customers anything off to make any money. So that U.K. market just why its spread is back to more of a normalized level versus the prior year. And so our products not only sold better to new prospects but we got greater utilization out of the customer base that we have, because the offer of our products was more attractive to them last year. So we are hoping that the 2013 environment stays basically in the same place as it was last year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] with Pacific Capital [ph]. 
Unknown Analyst: I have 2 quick ones, the first one as far as the Shell contract that concerned, can you guys please give us some sort of color to the size of that opportunity in terms of dollars and how much Shell revenues you guys have modeled in, into that $800 million of revenue for this year? And the second question, the universal card, can you guys replicate the same model with Visa or do you have some sort of exclusivity with Comdata that prevents you from doing anything else? 
Ronald Clarke: This is Ron. Let me take the Shell question first. So again I think the short answer is there's not much impact in revenue for our company as we roll out Shell. Though again the plan is to start to bring on more of their market this year and in the balance of their market next year, and what basically is changing is the nature of revenue that we’re getting. So in the prior couple of years we got paid for developing and migrating and supporting and helping basically get them prepared and get the system in, and now we’re going to get paid basically for them running our system. So it’s more attractive revenue to FleetCor but frankly it’s not much different in absolute size. And the comment about its absolute size is it’s not material, again it’s a single-digit million relationship both whether it was the prior development model or the existing one. The play there as we've said is we’ve build a good relationship with that company and our hope is to be helpful to them running their program globally where they could use this for other things beyond just being a processor for them. So that was always the basis on which we targeted them as a client. 
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our conference call for today. This is the conclusion of the FleetCor Technologies Incorporated fourth quarter conference call. We thank you for all of your participation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2012 Q3  (2012-11-08 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to FleetCor Technologies Incorporated Third Quarter Conference Call.
 At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Eric Dey, Chief Financial Officer. 
Eric Dey: Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. By now everyone should have access to our third quarter 2012 press release. It can also be found at www.fleetcor.com under the Investor Relation section.
 Throughout this conference call we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and EBITDA. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than other companies similarly titled non-GAAP information.
 Quantitative reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today’s press release and on our website as described previously. Also, we are reviewing 2012 guidance on a non-GAAP basis.
 Finally, before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements. This includes forward-looking statements about our 2012 guidance. They are not guarantees of future performance and therefore you should not put any undue reliance on them.
 These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today’s press release and Form 8-K filed with the Security (sic) [Securities]  and Exchange Commission. Others are discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. These documents are available on our website as previously described and at www.sec.gov.
 With that out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. 
Ronald Clarke: Okay Eric, thanks. Hi everyone and thanks for joining the call today. I plan to cover just a couple of subjects here in my opening remarks. So first off, I’ll provide a bit more perspective on Q3 and second, I’ll discuss the overall outlook for the company. Okay, so first off let me turn to our results for the quarter.
 The Q3 results we reported were really good and ahead of our internal plan. We set new record highs for both revenue and profit. We reported Q3 revenue of $187 million up 39% and cash EPS of $0.83 up 47%. Our adjusted net income grew over 50% for the quarter and our EBITDA reached almost $100 million for the quarter, so overall pretty good.
 So in terms of drivers, let me start with the environment and I describe the environment really as mixed for the quarter. Our market spreads returned to normalized levels, so not much help there. Fuel prices were flat in the U.S. but up a bit in Europe, so it helped our International segment some.
 We enjoyed a favorable onetime Q3 tax credit, which was worth roughly $0.03 in the quarter, so kind of operating EPS really $0.80 for the quarter and on the negative side FX was the headwind reducing our revenue approximately $3 million versus constant currency, so really again a bit of a mixed bag.
 Our North American business had another really terrific quarter. Adjusted revenues grew 11%, all organic and our universal card programs drove most of that upside, beating our internal expectations really across the board. Our CLC business continued to perform well. It was up 14% for the quarter. And then lastly our recent acquisitions, AllStar, Efectivale, CTF and NKT were all added into the quarter, so that gave us lots of additional lift.
 So in summary, we are obviously very pleased with these Q3 numbers and given our trends, we are raising our Q4 and full year guidance to reflect this momentum and Eric will cover those details in just a bit.
 So now let me transition over to the company’s outlook and begin talking about our current state of the union. So obviously we are pleased with how the company’s performing.
 Our performance is really across the board, virtually every business doing well. Most of our key metrics are in a very good place, client satisfaction and retention levels are improving, new sales are up, credit losses are stable, expenses are under control and our system reliability is sound. So given these trends we believe we can keep moving our base business forward despite being in a neutral economy. So overall I characterize our core business as very healthy.
 Second, in terms of outlook, we believe there is a big, big upside in our new assets. So we’ve acquired 4 businesses or 4 new assets in the last year, all outside of North America and we are making some good progress, improving profits in each one of them.
 So for example we are converting right now our AllStar business in the U.K. to GFN, our global processing platform and this conversion will deliver not only material expense saving, but sets the business up to do new things like e-billing, offer chip and pin cards, give us even some new pricing alternatives.
 In our Mexico business Efectivale, we are well underway reshaping that business, moving clients from paper to cards and emphasizing fuel, which carries much higher margins for us. We are also launching a universal fuel card there, which we believe the market will like.
 So in summary we expect these 4 new assets to yield higher profits for us as we move into 2013 and ‘14.
 Finally, we remain very active in our global business development efforts. We are accomplishing a number of the goals that we set out, so we are getting into new markets, more attractive markets that give us access to more market potential and a longer runway.
 We are getting our GFN system accepted and recognized as the best fuel card system in the world. We are upsizing our credit facility by $500 million, bringing our available liquidity to $1 billion and we are committed to focusing that $1 billion of liquidity on businesses we know and businesses in which we can improve performance.
 We remain very active in both new partner development and new acquisition situations and we’ve even stepped up our investment in new add-on product capabilities, mostly centered around mobile tools. So we believe the company is well positioned to do even bigger things in the future.
 So in conclusion, we are pleased with our Q3 results, we are pleased with our trends and momentum and we are very encouraged by some big, big opportunities in front of us.
 So with that, let me turn the call back over to Eric to cover our financial results and updated guidance in more detail. Eric. 
Eric Dey: Thanks Ron. For the third quarter of 2012 we reported revenue of $186.9 million, an increase of 39% from the third quarter of 2011. Revenue from our North American segment increased 9.1% to $101.5 million in the third quarter of 2012 from $93 million in the third quarter of 2011 and revenue from our international segment increased 107% to $85.4 million in the third quarter of 2012 from $41.2 million in the third quarter of 2011.
 For the third quarter of 2012 GAAP net income increased 47% to $59.7 million or $0.69 per diluted share from $40.5 million or $0.48 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2011.
 The other financial metrics that we routinely use to measure our business are adjusted revenues and adjusted net income, which we sometimes also refer to as cash net income. Adjusted revenues equal our GAAP revenue less merchant commissions. We use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate the company’s revenues, net of the commissions that are paid to merchants who participate in certain card programs.
 Commissions paid to merchants can vary when market spreads fluctuate in much the same way some of our revenue can fluctuate when markets spreads vary. For this reason we believe the adjusted revenue financial metric is a more effective way to evaluate the company’s performance.
 Adjusted net income is GAAP net income adjusted to eliminate noncash stock-based compensation expense related to share-based compensation awards, amortization of deferred financing cost and intangible assets, amortization of the premium recognized on the purchase of receivables, a loss on early extinguishment of debt and adjusted for the income tax effect of such. The reconciliation of adjusted revenues and adjusted net income to our GAAP numbers are provided in Exhibit 1 of our press release.
 Adjusted revenues in the third quarter of 2012 increased 44% to $174 million compared to $120.9 million in the third quarter of 2011. Adjusted net income for the third quarter of 2012 increased 52% to $71.6 million or $0.83 per diluted share compared to $47.2 million or $0.56 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2011.
 For the third quarter of 2012, transaction volume increased 46% to 79 million transactions compared to 54 million transactions in the third quarter of 2011. Our transaction volumes in our international segment were positively impacted by 2 acquisitions closed in the second half of 2011 and 2 acquisitions closed in the first 3 quarters of 2012.
 To remind everyone, in August of 2011 we acquired Efectivale, a Mexican pre-paid fuel and food card company, and in December of 2011 we acquired AllStar Business Solutions, a leading U.K. fuel card company. In mid-June of this year we completed an acquisition in Russia and in July we expanded into the Brazilian market with our acquisition of CTF Technologies.
 Adjusted revenue per transaction for the third quarter of 2012 decreased 1.6% to $2.20 from $2.23 in the third quarter of 2011. Adjusted revenue per transaction can vary based on geography, the relevant merchant and customer relationship, the payment product utilized and the types of products or services purchased, a mix of which will be influenced by our acquisitions, organic growth in the business and fluctuations in environmental factors such as foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and fuel price spread.
 Adjusted revenue per transaction for the quarter was positively impacted by organic growth in certain of our payment programs. Also during the third quarter we believe that the environment both helped and hurt our businesses.
 Spreads and foreign exchange rates were generally unfavorable, while fuel prices were flat in the U.S. and up slightly in our international market. Although we cannot precisely measure the impact of the environment, in total we believe the environment hurt our revenues by approximately $4 million to $5 million during the quarter, which I will describe later.
 In addition, while the AllStar business in the U.K. and our business in Mexico, Efectivale, represent good profit margin businesses, they do have lower revenue per transaction products. The impact of the product offered by our businesses acquired in the U.K. and Mexico were partially offset by the impact of acquisitions completed in 2012.
 In 2012 we acquired a Russian fuel card business and CTF Technology Inc. in Brazil, which have higher revenue per transaction products in comparison to our other businesses. However the overall impact of these acquisitions resulted in lower revenue per transaction for our international and consolidated revenues.
 Now let's shift over and discuss some of the drivers of our third quarter performance. First, in our North American segment, all of our lines of businesses performed well, resulting in an 11% organic growth rate in the quarter versus prior year at the adjusted revenues line. However, included in the North American segment revenue in the quarter was the impact of lower fuel price spread.
 During the quarter the wholesale cost of fuel rose at a higher rate than the retail price of fuel, which compressed fuel spread margins and which we believe adversely impacted our revenue by approximately $2 million to $3 million. Fuel prices were generally flat versus last year in the U.S. and had very little impact on the quarter.
 Some of the positive drivers of revenue during the quarter included the continued exceptional performance of our direct market MasterCard product, which had revenue growth of 49% year-over-year. The CLC Group, provider of lodging management programs, continued to perform well and had another solid quarter with 14% revenue growth over the third quarter of last year.
 In our international business our results were positively impacted by the 2 acquisitions closed in the second half of 2011, Efectivale, the Mexican pre-paid fuel and food card company, and AllStar, a leading fuel card company in the U.K., and the 2 acquisitions closed in 2012, CTF in Brazil and the acquisition in Russia.
 In addition, our independent fuel card provider based in Russia, PPR, continued to grow with revenues up double digit over last year in local currency. Also the Mexican prepaid fuel and food card portion of our business is off to a strong start with revenues up double digits in local currency. However, the results in our international business were negatively impacted by the sluggish economy in Europe and unfavorable foreign exchange rates during the quarter.
 As we previously stated, the macro-economic environment was generally unfavorable during the third quarter and although we cannot precisely calculate the impact, we believe it negatively impacted our revenues by approximately $4 million to $5 million. When we talk about the macro-economic environment, we are referring to the impact of market-spread margins, fuel prices, foreign exchange rates and the economy in general, can have on our business.
 During the third quarter, the increase in the wholesale cost of fuel resulted in lower fuel spread margins, which we believe negatively impacted our revenues by approximately $2 million to $3 million. Changes in foreign exchange rates were generally unfavorable and impacted our revenues by approximately $3 million during the quarter. And finally fuel prices were generally flat in the U.S. and up a bit in Europe and we believe added approximately $1 million in international revenue.
 Now moving down the income statement, total operating expenses for the third quarter were $101.1 million compared to $72.5 million in the third quarter of 2011, an increase of 39%. Included in operating expenses are merchant commissions, processing expenses, bad debt, selling and general administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expense.
 The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to additional expenses related to acquisitions closed in the second half of last year and the first 3 quarters of this year. Included in operating expenses for the quarter was $6.9 million of mostly noncash stock compensation expense versus $3.7 million in the third quarter last year. Approximately $1 million of additional stock compensation expense was recorded in the third quarter based on expectations that certain employees restricted stock investing hurdles will be met by year end.
 As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses remain flat at 54% compared to the third quarter of 2011. Credit losses were 13 basis points for the quarter compared to 20 basis points in the third quarter of 2011. The improvement in credit losses was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions closed in 2011 and 2012, which have products with lower bad debt as a percentage of billed revenue, improvement in the economy and a shift in our marketing and sales strategy towards the larger fleet prospects.
 Depreciation and amortization increased 50.1% to $13.6 million in the third quarter of 2012 from $9.1 million in the third quarter of 2011. The increase was primarily due to the impact of amortization of intangible assets related to our acquisition in Mexico in the third quarter of 2011, the AllStar acquisition in the U.K. in the fourth quarter of 2011, the acquisition in Russia in June of 2012 and the acquisition in Brazil in July of 2012.
 Interest expense increased 3.7% in the third quarter to $3.2 million from $3.1 million in the third quarter of 2011. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to additional borrowings related to acquisitions closed over the last year, partially offset by slightly lower interest rate.
 Our effective tax rate decreased to 27.8%, our pre-tax income compared to 31.5% for the third quarter of 2011. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the recognition of a onetime income tax benefit during the quarter of $3.5 million that resulted from our net deferred tax liability in the U.K. being reduced due to the enactment of a lower statutory U.K. tax rate. The impact of this onetime income tax benefit on adjusted net income per share was approximately $0.04 per share in the quarter.
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $352.2 million of total cash, $52.2 million of which is restricted and are primarily customer deposits. The company also has a $500 million accounts receivable securitization facility. At the end of the quarter we had $355 million borrowed against the facility and had the ability to draw an additional $50 [ph] million based on eligible receivables pledged against the facility. We also had $282 million outstanding on our term loan and $208 million drawn on our revolver.
 On November 7 we announced that we have increased the size of our credit facility by $500 million. The increased credit facility will total $1.4 billion and consist of a $550 million term loan facility and an $850 million revolving credit facility. The interest rate on the upside facility will remain unchanged. At the time of closing we drew an additional $250 million of term loan, which we used to immediately pay down the revolver and securitization facility.
 And for closing, the company has approximately $1 billion of liquidity, which will be used primarily to fund future acquisitions, other general corporate purposes, including to potentially fund share repurchases from certain of our significant legacy investors. The terms and timing of any future repurchases would be subject to the discretion of our board of directors and we currently do not have any specific plan.
 As of June 30 our leverage ratio was 1.34x EBITDA, a slight increase from 1.2x at the end of the second quarter. The increase was due to additional borrowing on the revolving credit facility to close the CTF acquisition in the third quarter. At September 30 our leverage ratio remains well below our covenant level of 3.25x EBITDA.
 The company intends to use its free cash flow to temporarily pay down the balance on the revolving credit facility and securitization facility and maintain liquidity for acquisitions and other corporate purposes. Finally, we are not a capital-intensive business as we spent approximately $5.2 million on CapEx during the third quarter of 2012.
 Now, onto our outlook for 2012. Given our very favorable results in the first 9 months of the year and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are again increasing our guidance for 2012. We now expect revenue for 2012 to be between $678 million and $682 million, up from our previous guidance range of $665 million to $675 million.
 Adjusted net income to be between $248 million and $251 million, up from our previous guidance range of $235 million to $240 million and we expect adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $2.89 and $2.91, up from our previous guidance range of $2.74 to $2.78.
 The assumptions that we have made in preparing this guidance include fuel prices flat to current levels for the fourth quarter of 2012, market spreads to return to their historic normal levels in the fourth quarter, a slight decrease in our effective tax rate from 30.1% in 2011 to 29.8% for the full year of 2012, foreign exchange rates to remain at current levels for the fourth quarter, fully diluted shares outstanding of 86.2 million shares for the full year of 2012, and finally, no impact related to any future acquisitions or material new partnership agreement.
 And with that said, operator, we will open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs. 
Julio Quinteros: Just really quickly, on the organic commentary, I just want to make sure, the 11% growth, that was only concentrated in North America, is that correct? 
Ronald Clarke: Correct. 
Eric Dey: That’s correct Julio. 
Julio Quinteros: Okay, so by definition everything else would have been acquired for the reported revenues. 
Eric Dey: No, that’s actually not correct. I mean we’ve got organic growth clearly in our European operations as well. If you remember when I commented on like the international businesses, I kind of talked about each one individually. So we had kind of had double-digit growth in our Russian business, double-digit growth kind of in the mid-teens in our Mexican business.
 Our Brazilian business is actually up, certainly double-digit levels over prior year as well and then our European businesses are kind of flat to perhaps down a little bit because of the economy. 
Julio Quinteros: Okay, great, that’s helpful. And then as you guys have had a chance now to kind of look at the integration and the plans around some of the recent acquisitions here, is there anything either from a cost or revenue perspective that you guys are seeing, that provides move opportunity as we really start thinking about 2013 and what the contributions could be here, again, either from a revenue or a cost integration perspective. 
Ronald Clarke: Julio, its Ron. I would say they are probably consistent with our theses when we did the deals, which would be pretty significant next year. But we’ve owned a couple of them almost a year and certainly will be a year by December in the case of AllStar, so we are pretty well underway in making improvements. 
Julio Quinteros: Okay, got it. And then just lastly on the ramp of the new assets. When it's all said and done, are there any targets in terms of we should be thinking about how much the fuel spread business could contribute to revenues over time. That’s something can cause some noise quarter-to-quarter, but anyway think about how the new contribution from the new businesses could impact the overall mix there as you start looking at the kind of longer term view. 
Eric Dey: Generally Julio, the businesses that we are acquiring are non-fuel spread based businesses. So as a percentage of our total revenue, that mix should decrease over time. 
Ronald Clarke: Julio, its Ronald. The last four are basically zero in terms of fuel-spread dependency. 
Julio Quinteros: Yes, I realized that. I was just wondering if there was a target or something that you guys had in mind in terms of where you would like to get the overall contribution from that type of business. 
Eric Dey: No, it's just another revenue sources. We have many different models around the world and that’s just one of our models. 
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. 
Adam Carron: This is actually Adam Carron for Darrin. Just in terms of what we are seeing in the international segment, is there any way you could help parse out your exceptions for revenue per transaction on a go-forward basis. Obviously we saw a little bit of a jump sequentially here from second quarter to third quarter. And it was down much less on a year-over-year basis. Is there any way to think about that going forward? 
Eric Dey: Well, you know what happens Adam is, when we buy some of these businesses, generally speaking some of those businesses have lower revenue per transaction products, like the Efectivale business and the AllStar business as an example. Some of the businesses actually have higher revenue per tran businesses, like the CTF business and actually the Russian acquisition that we recently completed.
 Generally though, after we buy these businesses we improve the performance of those businesses and the revenue per tran in each of those business will start to increase over time. But generally when we just buy them, it can have a negative impact on the run rate, just because of the mix of the new business. 
Adam Carron: Okay, and then that’s very helpful. And then just a quick follow-up in terms of, could you guys provide us with an up-date in terms of the rollout of Shell. I think you guys were just looking at -- your expectations would exceed in the fourth -- or, in October of 2012 and just maybe you could quantify what we should expect in terms of an impact to transactions and revenue per tran there. 
Ronald Clarke: Yes Adam, it’s Ron. We are kind of at the one-yard line in terms of being ready to launch into the first market, T minus some set of dates here and so there would be virtually kind of no impact here in 2012, and then I would assume that we would probably board about half the transactions next year and the other half the following year, kind of half in ‘13 and half in ‘14. 
Operator: [Operators Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Phil Stiller with Citi Group. 
Philip Stiller: I wanted to ask about the margins. We were a bit surprised to see them up on a year-over-year basis. I think your commentary related to some of the recent acquisitions was that those were lower margin businesses. So I was wondering if you can provide some color on what drove the margin increase on a year-over-year basis and what you guys expect going forward. 
Eric Dey: Hey Phil, this is Erick. Yes, if you look at our margins kind of in each of our 2 segments, at the North American level our margins were up kind of, I don’t know, 3% to 4% and what drives that effectively is the organic growth in the business. So really nothing unusual going on from that segment perspective.
 If you look at the international business they are probably down a little but -- and that’s driven primarily by the mix impact, obviously of adding the lower margin businesses into the portfolio. But I would say that on a consolidated level, our margins are exactly where we thought they were going to be. 
Philip Stiller: Is there a point at some point in the near future where you reach an inflection point in international margins, given the cost savings that you guys are pursuing on some of these deals? 
Eric Dey: We are just starting that process Phil, so there’s a long runway between when we are going to start reaching any inflection point on the new deals. As Ron indicated, I mean we are just starting with AllStar and we are just scratching the surface with some of our other acquisitions. So there’s a pretty good runway in front of them. 
Ronald Clarke: Yes Phil, it’s Ronald. The leverage tends to be onetime on the cost side, but it's kind of never ending on the revenue side, both pricing and then what we call product upgrades or mix or the add-ons. So again, I think our message is consistent, that we expect margins to continually increase. 
Philip Stiller: Okay. On the topic of deals, can you provide an update on what your pipeline is looking like. I’m assuming you guys still remain pretty optimistic given the increase in the credit facility here. 
Ronald Clarke: Yes, we like to have some money, so yes Phil, I would say as always the same line, busy. What we are involved in both on the partner side, oil partner and on the pure acquisition side, we are in multiple situations on both of those fronts, one of the reasons obviously we up-sized the line. 
Philip Stiller: Yes, can you provide some more color on the partnership opportunities? It seems like your still progressing along with Shell, although it’s probably been a little slower than you original anticipated. As we think about potential new deals, are those continuing to get pushed out and if we think about you signing them, would they require capital to do so? 
Ronald Clarke: Yes so the answer is it’s a mix. So of the partner opportunities we are looking at, we have both kind of processing-only kinds of opportunities and we have more full service outsourcing opportunities as well. We have some that require 0 capital, it’s just taking over and provisioning a service and we have others where we’re “effectively acquiring” the card base and paying some premium basically to do that. So it’s a mix, Phil, across the things we are working on. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Those are all the questions we have for today and that does conclude the conference call as well. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2012 Q2  (2012-08-08 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. [Operator instructions] Welcome to FleetCor Technologies, Inc. Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Eric Dey, CFO. 
Eric Dey: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. By now, everyone should have access to our second quarter 2012 press release. It can also be found at www.fleetcor.com under the Investor Relations section.
 Throughout this conference call we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues and adjusted net income. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than other companies’ similarly titled non-GAAP information. Quantitative reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today's press release and on our website as described previously. Also, we are reviewing 2012 guidance on a non-GAAP basis.
 Finally, before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements. This includes forward-looking statements about our 2012 guidance. They are not guarantees of future performance and, therefore, you should not put any undue reliance on them. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Others are discussed in our Form 10-K, which is available at www.sec.gov.
 With that out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? 
Ronald Clarke: Okay, Eric, thanks and hello, everyone, and thanks, as always, for joining our call today. I'll plan to cover 3 subjects here in my opening remarks. First, I'll provide a little color on our Q2 results, second, I'll update you on our global business development efforts and, finally, I'll comment on our full year guidance and the implied growth rates.
 So, first off, to Q2. The Q2 results we reported were terrific. Record-breaking, in fact. The company set new all-time highs in both revenue and profit. We reported Q2 revenue of $172 million, up 28%, and cash EPS of $0.73, also up 28%.
 The macro environment was a mixed bag in terms of its impact on our Q2 performance. Fuel prices were generally neutral across all of our markets, but market spreads were incredibly helpful this quarter contributing approximately $4 million of incremental revenue and approximately $0.03 of cash EPS above normalized levels. FX rates were really the opposite, were not good. In fact, quite unfavorable and depressed our revenue approximately $4 million versus constant currency. So, really a mixed bag.
 In terms of our line of business performance, our North America results were very, very good. Revenue grew 15%, all organic and the continued growth of our universal cards drove most of that performance. In fact, in total, our set of universal card transaction growth exceeded 30% quarter-over-quarter. So this new product line continues to perform well.
 Europe came in, basically, on our internal plan. Our Czech and U.K. businesses stayed pretty much in neutral. Our Russia business continued its rapid growth and we got a big contribution from a new full quarter of AllStar. So, obviously, that helped.
 So, in summary, our Q2 results exceeded our expectations and did so almost across the board. Let me step back now from the quarter and talk just a bit about our overall global business development activity.
 First off, we recently reorganized internally and tasked 2 of our most senior execs with new full-time, exclusive focus on BD and a transition out of their day-to-day operating assignments. So we believe this move and this focus will further step up our partner and deal pressure.
 Let me comment just a bit now on Shell and our status there. We're roughly a year and a half into this new relationship and we expect our global GFN system to go live in October. We hope to convert a few of their Russian markets this year and then continue a rapid rollout across Europe next year. And, although a bit slower than planned, all systems are go at this stage.
 Now on to Efectivale, our recent fuel and food card acquisition in Mexico. Our early progress there is encouraging. We're moving the business portfolio to fuel and to cards, which is away from vouchers. We're rationalizing both pricing and cost, which are leading to increasing profit margins and we're even testing some new web and telesales channels to boost overall sales there and we're actually using Spanish speaking teams in our Atlanta office to drive the pilot. So, stay tuned on that. So, net-net, we're very pleased with this Mexico deal and tracking ahead of plan.
 Finally, let me catch up on our AllStar Business in the U.K. So now that we've cleared OFT review, we are actively managing all aspects of that business. We're in the process of converting AllStar to our global GFN processing platform and expect to be complete by year end.
 We're also beginning to integrate our other U.K. businesses into AllStar and believe that will lead to higher margins. So 6 months in we're bullish on our prospect to increase AllStar profits, certainly over the mid-term.
 In terms of pipeline, our deal pipeline remains full. We're actively engaged in a couple of new partner RFPs and we're also in a number of new acquisition conversations. We've got ample liquidity, roughly $400 million to pursue new deals and the ability to flex up our credit line if we're in need of more capital. We're also quite comfortable with our current leverage ratio of approximately 1.2x.
 Let me now transition over to our financial guidance for the balance of the year. So, first off, our assumptions, FX, we're assuming FX will stay basically at its current levels. Same with fuel price. We're assuming fuel prices will remain roughly at today's levels. Market spreads we expect a return to their kind of historic or normalized levels. And, then, finally, we expect the macro-economic growth to be essentially neutral or zero.
 So this set of assumptions leads to the following full-year guidance at the midpoint. Revenue of $670 million implying a 29% full year growth rate and cash EPS at $2.76 implying a 27% full year growth rate. So if we achieve this full-year guidance, we will have delivered on average 25% earnings growth for our first 2 years as a public company. So, not too bad.
 So, in closing, we're feeling very good. Our Q2 results were excellent. Our rest of year outlook is encouraging. Our global strategy is gaining traction. We're getting positions in attractive markets, markets we believe will grow fast. And our overall BD capability is maturing and we're doing things like reorging the place, even more emphasis on that.
 So with that, let me turn the call back over to Eric to cover our financial results in more detail. Eric? 
Eric Dey: Thanks, Ron. For the second quarter of 2012 we reported revenue of $171.8 million, an increase of 28% from the second quarter of 2011. Revenue from our North American segment increased 15.5% to $107.3 million in the second quarter of 2012 from $92.9 million in the second quarter of 2011. And revenue from our international segment increased 56.1% to $64.5 million in the second quarter of 2012 from $41.3 million in the second quarter of 2011.
 For the second quarter, GAAP net income increased 48% to $54.4 million from $36.7 million in the second quarter of 2012, or $0.63 per diluted share compared to $0.44 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2011.
 The other financial metrics that we routinely used to measure our business are adjusted revenues and adjusted net income, which we sometimes also refer to as cash net income. Adjusted revenues equal our GAAP revenues less merchant commission. We use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate the company's revenue net of the commissions that are paid to merchants who participate in certain card programs.
 Commissions paid to merchants can vary when market spreads fluctuate in much the same way some of our revenue can vary when market spreads fluctuate. For this reason, we believe the adjusted revenue financial metric is a more effective way to evaluate the company's performance. The reconciliation of adjusted revenues and adjusted net income to our GAAP numbers are provided in Exhibit 1 of our press release. Adjusted net income is GAAP net income adjusted to eliminate non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to share-based compensation awards. Amortization of deferred financing costs and intangible assets, amortization of the premium recognized and the purchase of receivables, a loss on early extinguishment of debt and adjusted for the income tax effect of such.
 Adjusted revenues in the second quarter of 2012 increased 29% to $154.3 million compared to $119.3 million in the second quarter of 2011. Adjusted net income for the second quarter of 2012 increased 32% to $63 million or $0.73 per diluted share compared to $47.8 million or $0.57 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2011.
 For the second quarter of 2012, transaction volume increased 49.3% to 74.2 million transactions compared to 49.7 million transactions in the second quarter of 2011. Our transaction volumes in our international segment were positively impacted by 2 acquisitions closed in the second half of 2011. To remind everyone, in September of 2011 we acquired Efectivale, a Mexican pre-paid fuel and food card company and in December of 2011 we acquired AllStar Business Solutions, a leading U.K. fuel card company.
 We also completed another acquisition in Russia in mid June which had a minimal impact on transaction volumes in the second quarter, but will impact transaction volumes positively in the second half of the year. And to remind everyone, we recently expanded into the Brazilian market with our acquisition of CTF Technologies. Transaction volumes in the second half of the year will also be positively impacted by this acquisition.
 Adjusted revenue per transaction for the second quarter of 2012 decreased 13.3% to $2.08 from $2.40 in the second quarter of 2011. Adjusted revenue per transaction can vary based on geography, the relevant merchant relationship and payment product utilized and the types of products or services purchased. The mix of which will be influenced by our acquisition, organic growth in the business and fluctuation in environmental factors, such as foreign exchange rates, fuel prices, and fuel price spread.
 Adjusted revenue per transaction for the quarter was positively impacted by organic growth in certain of our payment programs. While the environment had minimal impact as it was mostly neutral. While the AllStar Business in the U.K., our business in Mexico and our recent acquisition in Russia represent good profit margin businesses, they do have lower revenue per transaction products. And when combined with our other businesses' revenues, result in a lower revenue per transaction that would have resulted without the acquisitions.
 Now let’s shift over and discuss some of the drivers of our second quarter performance. First, in our North American segment, all of our lines of businesses performed well resulting in a 15.5% organic growth rate in the quarter versus prior year. Of particular note, the decrease in the wholesale cost of fuel resulted in higher fuel spread margins, which added approximately $4 million in incremental revenue. And our MasterCard product again continued to perform well during the quarter.
 Revenue generated from this product increased 48% year-over-year. These items help drive the approximately 25% increase and our combined North American direct fuel card business during the quarter. CLC Group, a provider of lodging management programs, continued to perform well and had another solid quarter with 16% revenue growth over the second quarter of last year. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in same store sales and higher sales volumes, particularly in our higher margin products.
 In our international business, our results were positively impacted by the 2 acquisitions closed in the second half of 2011. Efectivale, the Mexican prepaid food and fuel card company and AllStar, a leading fuel card company in the U.K. In addition, our independent fuel card provider based in Russia, PPR, continued with its impressive growth trend with revenues up double digit over last year. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in same-store sales and strong new customer sales resulting in higher transaction volumes. Also, Efectivale is off to a strong start with revenues up double digits in local currency.
 However, the results in our international business were negatively impacted by the sluggish economy in Europe and unfavorable foreign exchange rates during the quarter. The macro-economic environment was generally neutral during the second quarter. When we talk about the macro-economic environment, we are referring to the impact of market spread margins, fuel prices, foreign exchange rates and the economy in general can have on our business. During the second quarter, the decrease in the wholesale cost of fuel resulted in higher fuel spread margins which added approximately $4 million in incremental revenue or about $0.03 per diluted share. However, the higher fuel spread margins were mostly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Fuel prices had a generally neutral effect as they were not materially different the prior year.
 Now moving down the income statement. Total operating expenses for the second quarter were $90.4 million compared to $74.3 million in the second quarter of 2011, an increase of 22%. Included in the operating expenses are merchant commissions, processing expenses, bad debt, selling and general administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expense.
 The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to additional expenses related to the Efectivale acquisition and the AllStar acquisitions completed in the second half of 2011. Also, included in the operating expenses in the second quarter of 2012 were one time deal-related expenses related to the Russian acquisition closed in June of 2012 and the CTF acquisition closed in early July of 2012.
 However, as a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses decreased from 55.4% in the second quarter of 2011 to 52.6% in the second quarter of 2012. Credit losses were 15 basis points for the quarter compared to 25 basis points in the second quarter of 2011. The improvement in credit losses was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions closed in 2011, which have products with lower bad debt as a percentage of billed revenue, improvement in the economy and a shift in our marketing and sales strategy towards slightly larger fleet prospects.
 Depreciation and amortization increased 35.2% to $11.6 million in the second quarter of 2012 from $8.6 million in the second quarter of 2011. The increase was primarily due to the impact of amortization of intangible assets related to our acquisition of Efectivale in Mexico in the third quarter of 2011 and the AllStar acquisition in the U.K. in the fourth quarter of 2011.
 Interest expense decreased 18.3% in the second quarter to $2.8 million from $3.5 million in the second quarter of 2011. The decrease in interest expense is primarily due to a lower overall borrowing rate as a result of our new term loan and revolving credit facility, which we refinanced in June of 2011. In addition, we also experienced a lower overall borrowing rate related to the financing of our accounts receivable, including a lower interest rate in our AR securitization facility.
 Our effective tax rate decreased to 30.9% of pre-tax income compared to 31.8% for the second quarter of 2011. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the mix of earnings in our international businesses, which have lower tax rates than our U.S. businesses.
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $305.7 million of total cash. $50.1 million of which is restricted and are primarily customer deposits. The company also had a $500 million accounts receivable securitization facility. At the end of the quarter, we had $325 million borrowed against the facility and had the ability to draw an additional $19 million based on eligible receivables pledged against the facility.
 On February 6, we amended and extended our facility termination date until February of 2013. The renewal included a reduction in the facility's interest rate from CP plus 90 basis points to CP plus 75 basis points and also included a reduction in our unused line fee and the current purchase limit remains at $500 million.
 We also have $285 million outstanding on our term loan and $113 million drawn on our $600 million revolver. As of June 30, our leverage ratio was 1.2x EBITDA, a slight increase from 1.36x at the end of the first quarter. The decrease was primarily due to paying down the balance on our revolving credit facility in the second quarter. At June 30, our leverage ratio remains well below our covenant level of 3.25x EBITDA. The company intends to continue to use its free cash flow to temporarily pay down the balance on the revolving credit facility and securitization facility and maintain liquidity for acquisitions and other corporate purposes.
 Finally, we are not a capital-intensive business as we spend approximately $4.9 million on CapEx during the second quarter of 2012.
 Now, onto our outlook for 2012, given our very favorable results in the first half of the year, as well as our recently announced acquisitions of a Russian fuel card company and CTF Technologies in Brazil, we are updating our guidance for the remainder of 2012.
 We now expect revenue to be between $665 million and $675 million, up from our previous guidance range of $615 million to $625 million; adjusted net income to be between $235 million and $240 million, up from our previous guidance range of $217 million to $222 million; and adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $2.74 and $2.78, up from our previous guidance range of $2.55 to $2.60.
 Our second half of 2012 adjusted net income per diluted share includes approximately $0.06 to $0.07 for our recently completed acquisitions including deal and restructuring costs. The other assumptions that we have made in preparing this guidance includes fuel prices flat to current levels for the second half of 2012, market spreads to return to their historic normal levels, a 0.4% decrease in our effective tax rate, from 30.1% in 2011 to 29.7% in 2012.
 Foreign exchange rates to remain at current level, an increase in fully diluted shares outstanding to 86.2 million shares outstanding, from 85.9 million shares for the full year of 2012. Finally, no impact related to any future acquisitions or material new partnership agreement.
 With that said, operator, we’ll open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Glenn Fodor with Morgan Stanley. 
Glenn Fodor: Just on the reorg, you guys have never seemed to have a problem with acquisitions or integrations in the past or operations in general. Is there something more to the reorg within business development that you care to expand on? 
Ronald Clarke: Glenn, it’s Ron. Not really, it’s just about pressure. We’re trying to cover a lot of geography. The world is a big place, and we’ve got some people that are particularly skilled at B.D., in relationship building. So, we decided to kind of offload their day-to-day, and get them and their teams just kind of exclusively on it. So it was really just a way to assure that we keep the pressure up on a bigger playing field. 
Glenn Fodor: Okay, so more opportunistic than anything else? 
Ronald Clarke: Yes, we’ve got a lot going on, I think is the flip side of that. We’re active, so there’s a lot to do. 
Glenn Fodor: Okay, then investments for the Shell build-out, I forgot if these are being capitalized or not, but if they’re not, can you quantify the impact on margins we’re seeing maybe in basis point terms, and how we should expect the margins to expand as you put those behind you and the business starts to ramp? 
Ronald Clarke: Yes, it’s Ron again. So, I think a simple way, Glenn, to think about this is we’re in this development and implementation mode, for call it a year and a half, with Shell. So, the revenue that we’re receiving is in some ways related to that “work” that we’re doing. By its very nature, that kind of work is not particularly profitable, if you look at the traditional kind of tech company margins. So I think what you’ll see is as we transition out of that type of work and into transaction processing, although the revenues won’t move in a material way, obviously the margins will. Because we won’t be doing that same kind of obviously development and conversion work. 
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Phil Stiller with Citi. 
Philip Stiller: I just wanted to ask about the revenue guidance, you guys raised about $15 million. It seems like you beat it by a little more than $10 million in the quarter. How much of the incremental increase that you guys did for the revenue guidance is attributable to acquisitions that you recently completed? 
Eric Dey: Phil, this is Eric. Obviously we had a very good quarter, and some of the reasons behind the beat for the quarter were just good organic performance in our existing businesses. From a revenue guidance perspective, I would say in addition to the revenue beat in the first half of the year, I would say the remainder of that or a significant portion of the remainder of that was due to the acquisitions that we closed in the first half of the year. 
Philip Stiller: Okay. Then, I guess on the EPS, you also provided some color on what those acquisitions are contributing. But there’s also a fairly significant increase on top of that. Is that related to the first half beat, or are you expecting better profitability in the second half from the existing business? 
Ronald Clarke: Yes, Phil, it’s Ron. Both, right? So, you’ve got to think about the guidance that we gave before, which was what, 255 to 260? 
Philip Stiller: 255 to 260. 
Ronald Clarke: So let’s say, Phil, you use the midpoint of the guidance we gave, kind of 258. You add the beat, was what, $0.08? 
Philip Stiller: $0.07, $0.08. 
Ronald Clarke: You add with the guidance we gave, $0.06 to $0.07. I think you come up into the low 270’s, 272-ish. We’re guiding, obviously, kind of 276 at the midpoint, so I’d say it’s those things plus another kind of $0.03 or $0.04 of better performance that we expect. 
Philip Stiller: Okay. Then, just the last question for me, again, to talk about some of the investments that you’re making, some of these recent acquisitions, and you’re also absorbing some deal costs and restructuring costs associated with those deals. Can you quantify what those investments are for the full year, and what the benefits we should see from those as we get into next year and beyond? 
Ronald Clarke: Yes, let me comment on the first part, and then I’ll give the deal part to Eric. I’d say the way to think about the first part is it’s structural. It won’t go away. So, in other words, although we’ve done some fair number of deals and we’re spending millions predominantly in IT, I’d say that our expectation is that we’re kind of always going to be in that mode ,Phil, and that we’re going to build plans that reflect kind of that level of spend, of technology spend. The question will just be, what is it we’re spending it on? The projects will simply change probably more than getting some happy in expense. 
Philip Stiller: Okay, great. 
Eric Dey: Then, Phil, this is Eric. To answer the second part of your question, how much have we spent in deal related costs, in the second quarter, I think we’ve got about $1 million worth of deal related expenses in the quarter that are one-time in nature. 
Operator: The next question is from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: I wanted to ask first, just on the domestic revenue per tran, other than spread, what drove that increase and is it sustainable? Because that was quite a bit higher than what we had modeled. 
Ronald Clarke: Yes, Tien-Tsin, it’s mix again, right? It’s back to low single-digit tran in total. But again, a bunch of lines of business that were double-digit in volume growth. Those again, are the ones we’re investing in that have the higher revenue per tran. So again, if you peeled it back, what’s happening is we’re just increasing faster lines of business that have higher revenue per tran. Then, b, it’s continued card upgrading as I mentioned in my comments. We continue to keep moving the mix to universal cards that basically have a higher revenue per tran. We’ve started now, just in the second quarter, started to layer some of these add-ons that we’ve been speaking about. So, it’s basically business mix, it’s card upgrades, and it’s the start of our add-ons. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Okay. Good, good. Now, is that $4 million in spread benefit, is that pretty much all U.S.? Or does some of that come into the international side as well? 
Ronald Clarke: I’d say 80% or 85% here. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Okay. Good. That’s good for us to know. Then, just on credit losses, I think U.S. is trending obviously very favorably. What’s the outlook there? It looks like it’s performing way under the norm. 
Eric Dey: Tien-Tsin, this is Eric. I’d say it’s kind of more of the same, Tien-Tsin. We’re really not projecting it to go too far from where it is right now. A lot of the favorability that we experienced over the last couple of quarters was because we bought a couple businesses that have lower bad debt as a percentage of their build revenue. So, that mix of those new businesses has helped that overall basis point decrease. So, we would expect that number to be relatively consistent over the balance of the year. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Okay. You don’t see anything there. Okay, good. Last question, just on the MasterCard piece, with the litigation settlement there, with the 10 bps reduction interchange, would that apply to FleetCor, in terms of interchange cut? 
Ronald Clarke: Yes. I don’t think we have a clue, Tien-Tsin. I think we’re kind of in a wait and see mode, like you guys are. We’ve obviously seen it. We’ve obviously spoken to MasterCard, and frankly I don’t think we really understand it yet. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Yes. I wish I could say I fully understood it as well. All right, I appreciate it. I’ll figure that out. 
Eric Dey: Tien-Tsin, just to add on to that, even if it did it’s not very material. We have kind of modeled what the impact of that might be and it looks like a couple $3 million over the period of time that that would go into effect, some part of that in ’13 and some part of that in ’14. So, it’s not very material at all. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Okay, so $2 to $3 million net impact over the 8 months as it goes through as is worse case. 
Operator: [Operator instructions] Our next question is from the line Darrin Peller with Barclays. 
Adam Carron: This is Adam Carron here for Darrin. Great quarter, I just had a quick question for you on the margin trajectory over the second half of the year, obviously margins were very strong in the second quarter and a lot of that could be attributed to, I guess, the outperformance kind of seen in North America. Just to kind of help us get our heads around this, obviously, with the 2 new acquisitions coming on in the second half as well as what seems to be somewhat of a sustainable trend here in North America and Mexico, kind of performing maybe a little bit better than your expectations. How should we think about the trajectory in the margins as we exit the year here? 
Ronald Clarke: I would say that our margin, again all things being equal, are going to continue to perform extremely well and should start increasing. Our business in the United States should continue to grow organically at pretty attractive rates. Obviously we buy businesses that have been underperforming and we basically increase and enhance the performance of those businesses. So, we would expect to see certainly the margins of those businesses start to improve over time, which would impact the overall margin profile of the company. 
Adam Carron: Right. So, even as we bring on these 2 acquisitions here over the second half, we shouldn’t necessarily expect much of a material adverse impact just given the way the rest of the business is performing? 
Ronald Clarke: Yes. I’d say it will be down a bit, Adam, in totals if you took kind of the run rate businesses, Eric’s comment is we expected to be “better”. Still in the second half and the first, we said in the prior call, particularly the Brazil business has a much worse margin than the FleetCor line average. All that revenue and profit will hit for the first time here in the second half. So that will be a wait. I’m not sure we have that page in front of us, but the underlying business without that will continue its margin improvement for the reasons that I mentioned to Tien-Tsin about fundamentally mix and add-ons. We’re just generating more revenue per piece of work than we were before, which is great for margin. 
Adam Carron: Understood. 
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs. 
Julio Quinteros: Real quickly on the assumptions for revenue for transaction, not sure by business upfront, but when you think about revenue per transaction going forward, both in the North America and International and overlaying the 2 new acquisitions of the international side. How do we think about that in terms of your expectations for the revenue per tran? 
Ronald Clarke: Well, Julio, this is Eric, the revenue per tran in the United States, we would expect that to continue to increase over time because we expect obviously the business in the U.S. to continue to perform well for the reasons Ron described earlier in the call. At the international level, revenue per tran is going to continue to be impacted by the integration of the acquisitions. CTF, which we purchased on July 3 of this year, obviously has a lower revenue per tran product, so that’ll impact revenue per tran internationally, as does AllStar. In addition to that, as we begin to roll out Shell, that is a significantly lower revenue per transaction product, so that will impact revenue per tran at the international level as well. So, we’ll have to have some further conversations about how we’re going to look at that going forward to get into that. 
Eric Dey: But I say, Julio, I think again, per our IPO of 5% to 10% point-to-point in terms of incremental revenue per tran over the baseline. Again, we get it from mix and card enhancements and add-ons. We’ll get it particularly on the international front from virgin assets. We’re buying assets that in our eyes are “underperforming” in terms of margin, which creates even greater opportunities initially for revenue per tran increases. So you should think that we’re going to plan to increase off of these baselines once you sort these new pieces of portfolio in the 5% to 10% range. 
Julio Quinteros: Okay, got it. Then, just in terms of international exposure, macro headwinds, thinking about any contingencies on the margin side, what would you be looking for at this point, relative to flat or neutral European exposure at this point within sort of Czech and UK. If it were to get worse than where it currently is right now, what potential levers do you guys still have to think about in terms of protecting some of the margin structure there? 
Ronald Clarke: I’m not sure again, against big macro things, Julio, we’ve got all that many levers. I’d only say that look, we’ve been living all of us, not just FleetCor, in a world of kind of no growth here for years and we’re still growing earnings 25%. So, I think we’re kind of getting used to the world as it sits. To your point, if suddenly Europe got softer by 2 or 3 points, it will have a tiny -- it’s not going to take our business down, because the growth engine in the company obviously is not relying on GDP or same store growth. We’re getting no help from the health of our clients. We’re lucky if they’re all flat. So, the engine of this company really doesn’t rely on it. With that said, if we went back to the ’08 stuffed down, double-digit, and the health of companies, and then solvencies go. That’s a problem. That would be a problem for us. But it would have to go, again, pretty deep, like it did 3 or 4 years ago to be more than a blip for us. 
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Tim Willi with Wells Fargo. 
Timothy Willi: I apologize if you get rushed, as I just hopped on. But I was wondering if you could first talk about -- we’re a couple quarters now into AllStar, and I think part of that transaction was investing in product and I think the outbound sales efforts and adding some other marketing channels. Just wondering if you could comment to any progress or how you feel about those efforts and the payback as you continue to integrate that acquisition. Then, I had one follow-up. 
Ronald Clarke: Yes, Tim, it’s Ron. I’d say it’s still early. If you recall, we had this OFT review for the first kind of 5 months, where we were kind of hands-off. So, I’d say we’re slower out of the block. But call it with 2 or 3 months in, I think we’ve got a good plan that’s pretty clear, in place to improve margins. We’re going to change out their system over the next 3 or 4 months, which is a big deal. We started just in the last couple of weeks, the piloting of the other FleetCor sales approaches with that AllStar product. So I’d say when we get to kind of next quarter, I’ll have a better answer. But I’d say our view is still very positive on that asset at this point. 
Timothy Willi: Okay. Then, my follow-up was around the [indiscernible] business. I think I caught a comment about how that continued to do well. I guess I was curious about further expansion of the footprint of properties or customers that use the card. Is there anything going on, on either of those channels that’s worth noting out. Then, anything we should think about with that product let’s say in the next year or 2 around the European marketplace, or any plans there that should be considered? 
Ronald Clarke: Yes. I think that’s a good question. So, let me give you stat you might find interesting. So, in that hotel card business we serve kind of 2 types of clients, the big, big account like a railroad that has a million room nights a year and Ron’s tree-cutting company that has 5 rooms a month. So, we’ve been very focused on the second thing because that’s what we do with FleetCor. So, that business, the “small hotel card business”, our revenue in July, this month that we just had, was equal to the revenue of that line of business when we bought the company 3 years ago. So obviously we’ve gotten much better at building that. So, when you say, where are we going to focus, there’s a ton of these Ron tree-cutting companies that are looking for the kind of proposition that we’re offering and it’s a much higher revenue per tran and that’s driving some of this double digit. The second question, which I thought was a good one, is yes, we’ve got a fast-hitting product here. So, in that business it looks like some of our proprietary businesses where they went out to a network and signed up Tim’s Hotel, and then Eric’s Hotel, and then Ron’s Hotel, and cobbled kind of 20,000 different hotels together and got these deep discounts. Well, the good news about that is customers like that because when they go there, they get huge amounts off. What customers don’t like about that is they’re not sure which hotels are in that network. So much like our private label oil brand products and fuel cards, we’re going to create a private label product in the hotel card business. So that you, Tim’s tree-cutting, would have not only this deep discount network, but you might also have 4 or 5 hotel brands that you’re familiar with. Let’s say like Windham Hotels, and you could stay in any of those 5 brands anywhere in the country for still a pretty good discount. So in the research that we’ve done, that seems to be a very, very appealing add-on to this group of customers. 
Operator: That’s all the questions we have for today. We’d like to thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2012 Q1  (2012-05-09 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the FleetCor Technologies, Inc., First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]  At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Eric Dey, Chief Financial Officer. 
Eric Dey: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. By now, everyone should have access to our first quarter 2012 press release. It can also be found at www.fleetcor.com under the Investor Relations section.
 Throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues and adjusted net income. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than other companies' similarly-titled non-GAAP information. Quantitative reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today's press release and on our website, as described previously. Also, we are reviewing 2012 guidance on a non-GAAP basis.
 Finally, before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements. This includes forward-looking statements about our 2012 guidance. They are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore you should not put any undue reliance on them. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Others are discussed in our Form 8-K, which is available at www.sec.gov.
 With that out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? 
Ronald Clarke: Thanks, Eric. I thought I'd cover just a couple of subjects here in my opening remarks. First, I'll provide a little more color on our Q1 results. And second, I'll provide just a bit of an update on our acquisition and partnership initiatives. I don't plan to comment specifically on our pending CTF, Brazil, acquisition because we spoke about it at some length last week, but of course we're happy to take questions you might have once we get to that section of the call.
 Onto Q1. Our Q1 results were very good. We reported revenue of $146 million, up 32%. We reported cash EPS of $0.60, up 27%. So $146 million and $0.60. Obviously, growth well ahead of our 10% and 20% stated growth targets.
 The environment in Q1 was a bit of a mixed bag for us. Market spreads, which effect our Fuelman and KeyFuels businesses were below planned levels and below historic levels. So not great. FX rates were unfavorable versus last year. But on the good news front, fuel prices were favorable to both our plan and to last year. So net-net, we'd say the environment was probably neutral in terms of its impact on our Q1 performance.
 In terms of our U.S. businesses, all were up in Q1. Our U.S. Direct Business revenue grew over 20% for the quarter, driven by further MasterCard penetration and, really, record sales. Our U.S. partner business, that's our business that serves major oils, leasing companies and independent marketers, was also up due to continuous adoption of our extended network cards. And CLC, our hotel cards business, continued its growth mostly driven by further penetration of its check-in direct product, which is targeted at small and mid-sized businesses.
 On the Europe front, our U.K. and Czech businesses mostly treaded water for the quarter, although both of those businesses met their internal Q1 budgets. Our Russian business continues to perform well and grow fast. As you might remember, Russia is still purchasing 2/3 of all its commercial fuel via cash and vouchers. So that should provide a long runway for card adoption. And we're constantly looking at ways to deepen our position in that attractive market.
 On the sales front, Q1 sales were outstanding, record breaking in fact. U.S. fuel card sales grew 27% in the quarter, and the non-field channels, not field salespeople, contributed over 60% of all of U.S. sales in the quarter. Europe, as well, had a great sales quarter, growing 53% for the quarter. So really a terrific new sales client acquisition quarter.
 So I guess we'd say in summary, it feels like things are working. The company is performing and we're executing really to our plan pretty much across the board. So let me step back from the quarter and provide an update on our acquisition and partnership initiatives.
 Last year's acquisitions, our AllStar and Mexico deals, are performing right in line with our expectations. Both of these businesses have really terrific upside potential. The Mexico market is under-penetrate,  just like Russia. Business is there by fuel predominantly with cash and vouchers despite government tax incentives to use cards. And the fuel card business there is mostly prepaid and the economics are attractive, because both merchants and clients pay for the program. So we're really delighted to be positioned in that market.
 We spoke at some length last week of our recent Brazil signing and look forward to closing that deal and getting going in that market. Obviously lots of opportunity there. And finally, on the acquisition front, we still have a pipeline of new acquisition opportunities, again mainly outside of North America, and hope to bring you some news on that front over the coming quarters.
 Now let me transition over to the partnership front in which we target major oil companies and vehicle leasing companies to use our fuel card outsourcing services. Let me start off with Shell. We're now 15 months into our Shell contract with Logica and expect to implement the first market by the end of Q3 and then to roll out to most major markets during 2013. So pretty good progress there.
 We have just recently begun the rollout of our PHH leasing deal and expect to record revenue beginning in Q3, and we're excited to show PHH what we can do. We have begun servicing Arval now on an arm's length basis in the U.K. out of our AllStar business. We believe that this relationship may help us expand our dealings with other leasing companies throughout Europe. So we'll keep you posted on that.
 And finally, we're actively engaged in a couple of new European partner RFPs, which we've been told will make decisions in 2012. So we hope to have some news to report on that front before we exit this year.
 So in closing, it's really an exciting time for FleetCor. We're growing fast. We're executing on our organic growth plans. We've done exciting pipeline and add-ons. We're integrating these 2 new acquisitions that have real upside. And we're preparing to close our recently-signed Brazil transaction. And with Brazil, we will have established positions in Russia, Mexico and Brazil. So 3 incredibly attractive markets. We're implementing new partner relationships with Shell, PHH and Arval and in discussion with 2 new partners that expect to make 2012 decisions. So all-in-all, a pretty busy time at FleetCor.
 So with that, let me turn the call back over to Eric to cover our financial results in more detail. 
Eric Dey: Thanks, Ron. For the first quarter of 2012, we reported revenue of $146.2 million, an increase of 31.7% from the first quarter of 2011. Revenue from our North American segment increased 15.7% to $82.8 million in the first quarter of 2012 from $71.6 million in the first quarter of 2011. And revenue from our international segment increased 60.7% to $63.4 million in the first quarter of 2012 from $39.4 million in the first quarter of 2011.
 For the first quarter, GAAP net income increased 30.1% to $42.1 million from $32.3 million in the first quarter of 2012 or $0.49 per diluted share compared to $0.39 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2011. The other financial metrics that we routinely use to measure our business are adjusted revenues and adjusted net income, which we sometimes also refer to as cash net income. Adjusted revenues equal our GAAP revenues less merchant commission.
 We use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate the company's revenue net of the commissions that are paid to merchants who participate in certain card programs. Commissions paid to merchants can vary when market spreads fluctuate in much the same way some of our revenues can vary when market spreads fluctuate. For this reason, we believe that the adjusted revenue financial metric is a more effective way to evaluate the company's performance. The reconciliation of adjusted revenues and adjusted net income to our GAAP numbers are provided in Exhibit 1 of our press release.
 Adjusted net income is GAAP net income adjusted to eliminate non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to share-based compensation awards, amortization of deferred financing costs and intangible assets, amortization of the premium recognized in the purchase of receivables, the loss and early extinguishment of debt and adjusted for the income tax effect of such.
 Adjusted revenues in the first quarter of 2012 increased 32.2% to $135.8 million compared to $102.7 million in the first quarter of 2011. Adjusted net income for the first quarter of 2012 increased 29% to $50.8 million or $0.60 per diluted share compared to $39.3 million or $0.47 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2011.
 For the first quarter of 2012, transaction volume increased 54.2% to 72.4 million transactions compared to 47 million transactions in the first quarter of 2011. Our transaction volumes in our international segment were positively impacted by two acquisitions closed in the second half of 2011. To remind everyone, in September of 2011, we acquired a Mexican prepaid fuel and food card company. And in December, we acquired AllStar Business Solutions, a leading U.K. fuel card company.
 Adjusted revenue per transaction for the first quarter of 2012 decreased 14.4% to $1.87 from $2.19 in the first quarter of 2011. Adjusted revenue per transaction can vary based on geography, the relevant merchant relationship, the payment product utilized and the types of products or services purchased, the mix of which will be influenced by our acquisitions, organic growth in the business and fluctuation in environmental factors such as foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and fuel price spreads. Adjusted revenue per transaction for the quarter was positively impacted by organic growth in certain of our payment programs, while the environment had minimal impact, as it was mostly neutral.
 However, while both the AllStar business in the U.K. and our business in Mexico represent good profit margin businesses, they do a have lower revenue per transaction product, and when combined with our other businesses revenues, result in lower revenue per transaction that would have resulted without the acquisition.
 Now, let's shift over and discuss some of the drivers of our first quarter performance. First, in our North American segment, all of our lines of business performed well and were up versus prior year. Of particular note, our MasterCard product again continued to perform well during the quarter. Revenue generated from this product increased 37% year-over-year which helped drive the almost 16% increase in our combined North American fuel card business during the quarter.
 CLC Group, a provider of lodging management programs, started the year out strong with another solid quarter, with 16% revenue growth over the first quarter of last year. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in same-store sales and higher sales volumes, particularly in our higher-margin products.
 In our international business, our results were positively impacted by the 2 acquisitions closed in the second half of 2011: the Mexican prepaid fuel and food card company, and AllStar, a leading fuel card company in the U.K. In addition, our independent fuel card provider based in Russia, PPR, continue with its impressive growth trend with revenues up double digit over last year. This increase was driven primarily by an increase in same-store sales and strong new customer sales resulting in higher transaction volumes.
 The macroeconomic environment was generally neutral during the first quarter. When we talk about the macroeconomic environment, we are referring to the impact of market spread margins, fuel prices, foreign exchange rate and the economy in general can have on our business. During the first quarter, higher fuel prices were mostly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates and fuel spread margins continued below their historic average.
 Before I move down the income statement, I would like to comment on 2 acquisitions that we closed last year. First, our Mexican prepaid fuel and food card business in Mexico. We are very pleased so far with how this business has performed. The performance of the business is in line with our expectations and is shaping up to be another good addition to the FleetCor family. Similarly, the AllStar business in the U.K., acquired in December of last year, is also off to a good start and in line with the company's expectations.
 Now, moving down the income statement. Total operating expenses for the first quarter were $81.7 million compared to $60.5 million in the first quarter of 2011, an increase of 35%. Included in operating expenses are merchant commissions, processing expenses, bad debt, selling and general and administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization expenses. Included in operating expenses in the first quarter of 2012 were normal operating expenses related to the 2 acquisitions closed in 2011 and approximately $1 million of one-time deal-related expenses related to our acquisition activities and expenses associated with the company's secondary offering in the first quarter of 2012.
 Credit losses were 15 basis points for the quarter compared to 21 basis points in the first quarter of 2011. The improvement in credit losses was primarily due to the impact of the acquisitions closed in 2011, which have products with lower bad debt as a percentage of billed revenue, improvement in the economy and a shift in our marketing and sales strategy towards slightly larger fleet prospects.
 Depreciation and amortization increased 36.2% to $11.7 million in the first quarter of 2012 from $8.6 million in the first quarter of 2011. The increase was primarily due to the impact of amortization of intangible assets related to our acquisition in Mexico in the third quarter of 2011 and the AllStar acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2011.
 Interest expense increased 5.9% in the first quarter to $3.6 million from $3.4 million in the first quarter of 2011. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to additional borrowings to fund the acquisitions in 2011 and to finance working capital requirements in our AllStar business, partially offset by a lower overall borrowing rate as a result of our new term loan and revolving credit facility, which we refinanced in June of 2011.
 Our effective tax rate decreased to 30.2% of pretax income compared to 31.4% for the first quarter of 2011. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in earnings from our international businesses, which carry a lower tax rate.
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $344.3 million of total cash, $57.2 million of which is restricted and are primarily customer deposits. The company also has a $500 million accounts receivable securitization facility. At the end of the quarter, we had $341 million borrowed against the facility and have the ability to draw an additional $1.1 million based on eligible receivables pledged against the facility.
 On February 6, we amended and extended our facility termination date until February 2013. The renewal included a reduction in the facility's interest rate from CP plus 90 basis points to CP plus 75 basis points and also included a reduction in our unused line fee. The current purchase limit remained at $500 million. We also have $288.8 million outstanding on our term loan and $164 million drawn on our $600 million revolver.
 As of March 31, our leverage ratio was 1.36 times EBITDA, a slight increase from 1.27 times at the end of the fourth quarter. The increase was due to borrowing on our revolving credit facility related to the purchase of the AllStar business in December. However, our leverage ratio remains well below our covenant level of 3.25x EBITDA. The company intends to continue to use its free cash flow to temporarily pay down the balance on the revolving credit facility and securitization facility and main liquidity for acquisitions and other corporate purposes.
 Finally, we are not a capital-intensive business, as we spend approximately $3.6 million on CapEx during the first quarter of 2012.
 Now on to our outlook for 2012. Given our solid results in the first quarter, we are now guiding to the high end of our previously reported guidance range. As a reminder, we provided the following guidance on our February earnings call: revenue to be between $615 million and $625 million; adjusted net income to be between $217 million and $222 million; and adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $2.55 and $2.60.
 The company's full year guidance assumptions remain unchanged with the exception of an increase in fully diluted shares outstanding from 85.2 million shares in the prior guidance to 85.9 million shares outstanding. The increase in our share count is driven primarily from the increase in our stock price in the first quarter. Obviously, very positive for those of us that own FleetCor stock, but the increase in stock price negatively affects the calculation of fully diluted shares. The increase in share count is projected to negatively impact full year EPS by approximately $0.02. However, we are projecting adjusted net income to increase sufficiently to cover the impact of the higher share count.
 Some of the assumptions that we made in preparing the 2012 guidance that remain unchanged include the following: we assume market spreads to be consistent with the last thee year average, which is lower than 2011, and we assume fuel prices to be flat to the 2011 average; we are also assuming a 0.2% increase in our effective tax rate from 30.1% in 2011 to 30.3% in 2012.
 And finally, this guidance does not reflect the impact of any future acquisitions or material new partnership agreements, including the pending acquisition of CTF Technologies, the leading fuel payment platform provider in Brazil. As we stated on the CPF deal announcement call last week, we will provide our guidance for this acquisition after the deal actually closes, which is expected to be around June 30.
 Finally, for those of you who are looking for some quarterly guidance, I want to remind you that it will not be our practice to provide quarterly guidance. However, based on our current expectations, you should assume that EPS is going to increase on a sequential basis and each quarter is generally expected to be slightly better than the last.
 And with that said, Operator, we will open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Philip Stiller with Citi. 
Philip Stiller: I wanted to ask first about the M&A contributions in the quarter. Eric or Ron, can you quantify perhaps the revenue contributions from the 2 acquisitions you completed last year? 
Eric Dey: Hi Phil, this is Eric. Let me comment a little bit on the overall organic growth of the business for the quarter. You can see in our press release our North American segment was up approximately 16% for the quarter and our international segment was up about 60% for the quarter 2012 over 2011. The majority of the international increase was driven by the 2 acquisitions. 
Philip Stiller: If we look at the transaction growth rate in North America, it's been hanging around kind of low-single digits. A lot of the revenue growth there has been driven by higher revenue per transaction. Is that something that we should look to continue? Can you get the transaction growth rate improving without any additional help from the economic environment? 
Ronald Clarke: Phil, it's Ron. Again, it's mostly mix. So inside of that North America number is a couple of very large books of business that don't grow that have low revenue per tran. And so we're spending all of our money on the businesses that have higher revenue per tran. So that weights down effectively the businesses that are growing faster and it's a very, very big piece of the total trans. So the answer is because of that structurally, the answer is yes. You're going to continue to see on an aggregate basis lower tran growth and higher revenue per tran because of mix. 
Philip Stiller: On the cash flow in the quarter, you guys had a big spike in receivables. I was just wondering if you could provide some color on that and what your expectations for cash flow are this year. 
Eric Dey: Nothing unusual happened in the quarter from a receivable perspective. Obviously, fuel prices were rising in the quarter and our receivables can be impacted by a couple of things: one, obviously the rising fuel price; and secondly, by the day of the month that the closing actually occurs. But nothing unusual there at all. From a cash flow perspective for 2012, again, we provided adjusted net income guidance of between $217 million and $222 million, and that's effectively our cash flow. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Fodor with Morgan Stanley. 
Glenn Fodor: Just reconciling the guidance increase to the results in the quarter. There was some upside to the expectations, but your texture on Europe and the U.S. was that things that are just kind of trucking along and flat, but that you closed the quarter with very positive sales. Was that the driver for what appears to be maybe a little outsize increase versus the performance in the quarter? 
Eric Dey: I wouldn't say the sales had a big impact on the quarter, Glenn. I mean, sales certainly impact the business over the long term. But I would say over the short term, in Q1 as Ron indicated and like I said in my section of the call, basically all businesses kind of performed according to plan. So we were very pleased with the performance everywhere. The U.S. business was up about 16% organically kind of year-over-year and effectively beat our internal expectations. At the international level, obviously our revenue was up kind of 60%, driven to a large degree by the performance of our acquisitions. But again, I would say that all of our businesses performed well.
 And if you go back to the fourth quarter earnings call, we actually guided to $0.55 to $0.59. So we actually beat our guidance pretty handily in the first quarter. So I think overall, we're pretty pleased with the $0.60. From an overall perspective, obviously that beat in the first quarter obviously factored into our overall guidance perspective on the full year. Now we're guiding toward the high end of the range.
 It's also early in the year for us, Glenn. So I think you'll have more color on our full year guidance as we kind of get further into the year. 
Glenn Fodor: Are these things, we should imagine, like a Shell-type deal--or maybe not that size, but along those lines of terms and conditions? 
Ronald Clarke: We're active in 2 RFPs now in Europe, and they're both significant, large, well-known companies. Large, well-known companies. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Roman Leal with Goldman Sachs. 
Roman Leal: As a follow-up to the RFP question, in general, it seems like in Europe with the acquisitions and the potential partnerships and with the Shell partnership rolling out, is it safe to assume that the revenue per transactions trends will continue to be basically downward, obviously offset by the transaction growth, or is there something that you can do or any strategy to offset that? 
Ronald Clarke: Roman, it's Ron. On a line of business basis, they are all increasing. So you guys are looking at some aggregates or North American, international aggregate. If you unpeeled down to our lines of business, every line of business has revenue per tran growing. So the only reason that the aggregate is declining is mix. We buy a big book of business that's got half the revenue per tran, that obviously brings the average down. So the answer is, we've said it repeatedly, we're investing in the businesses that have higher revenue per tran. We're acquiring businesses that start off with lower revenue per tran, and we're increasing all of them. 
Roman Leal: On the 2 acquisitions in Mexico and Europe, can you describe the margin profile of those acquisitions? I thought you said that the margins were healthy, but the revenue per tran I guess was less than the overall. So any color on the margin profile there would be very helpful. 
Eric Dey: The margins of the 2 acquisitions obviously are very, very good, but they're a little bit lower than the FleetCor average. Again, we like to buy attractive assets in attractive markets, and to a large degree we like to buy under-performing assets that we can improve. And we believe like other acquisitions that we've had in the past, these are acquisitions that we believe that we can improve over time. Certainly they have very, very healthy margins and kind of in line with the rest of our businesses, but they are below kind of the line average.
 And then again, to your point on revenue per transaction, these are just lower revenue per transaction products. So as Ron indicated in his comment, when you factor in those businesses to our other businesses in the international segment, the mix of those businesses will cause the overall revenue per tran to decrease. But again, we manage the business on a business-by-business basis, not on the aggregate of just the international as a whole. 
Roman Leal: The last question is on seasonality. You mentioned that sequentially EPS should get stronger this year. Is that just a function of the timing of these acquisitions and the Shell transaction front on board, because it's been usually very kind of skewed towards the third quarter in the past? 
Ronald Clarke: Generally, seasonality-wise, the second and third quarters are better than the first and fourth because of basically holidays and weather in the markets that we're in. But underlying that is, we have a bunch of businesses that are growing and they grow quarter-to-quarter. So if you took out seasonality, every business that we have would either be the same or higher as you get into the fourth quarter than the first. And so that's underlying, Roman, the trends for the year.
 Glenn's question about if you did $0.60, how are you going to get to what,  we said $2.55 to $2.60. The answer is that Q2 and Q3, you get free lift for seasonality and the businesses that are growing have more revenue and profits in Q3 and Q4 than they do in Q1. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Just curious, now that you've owned AllStar and the Mexico asset, if you've seen or identified any sort of quick synergies or upside to some of your original synergy targets? 
Ronald Clarke: Tien-Tsin, it's Ron. As you know, we've spent a fair amount of time. We probably worked on the Mexico deal for 9 months-plus and the AllStar deal we've known for 4 or 5 years. So I'd say our thesis prior to close was relatively thorough in terms of what we thought we could do. There is a few things, but I'd say generally whatever, 4, 5 months in AllStar and 6 or 7 months in Mexico, it's setting up as we thought. The business is kind of a bit ahead of what we'd planned for both of them. And I think we remain very confident that we'll put our thesis into action and get more money out of those next year. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: And then just international transaction contribution from Mexico and AllStar, is there a way for us to get a review of what transaction looked like excluding that, Eric? 
Eric Dey: I would say, Tien-Tsin, that if you exclude Mexico and AllStar that our transaction growth on the international segment is kind of in line with where it's been running historically. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: That's what I figured you would say. Europe, given what's going on over there, I get the question a lot, just how cyclical can some of the transaction growth be? It sounds like it's pretty stable. I think you said Czech and U.K. was in line, Ron, but could we see things get a little bit worse? Have you seen any signs of that? 
Ronald Clarke: No, I'd say again, Tien-Tsin, that it seems kind of steady, steady as she goes. And again, I think maybe it's the markets again that we're in, we've got a big position in the U.K. and in Czech. And I'd say in both of those cases starting a 1.5 years ago, they stabilized and we're seeing nothing to change that view. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question is from the line of Wayne Johnson with Raymond James. 
Wayne Johnson: Just following up on the previous questions regarding AllStar and the Mexican acquisition. How long do you expect, in terms of timeline, will it take to bring those margins up to the corporate average? I mean what's your target for that? 
Ronald Clarke: Wayne, it's Ron. I would say you would see us getting the kind of line average probably middle, late next year. 
Wayne Johnson: And that would be the same for both? 
Ronald Clarke: Yes. I'd say we're a little farther ahead on the Mexico thing, because we obviously acquired it sooner and we worked on it a bit longer. But I'd say 12 months to 24 months into these things we've kind of put in place what we're looking to do. 
Wayne Johnson: Longer term, how should we think about the mix of U.S. revenues compared to rest of world? Do you guys have a target in mind for that? 
Ronald Clarke: Yes, more. I hope if my comments weren't clear that I can make them clear. We're about getting positions in attractive places where the penetration rates and the growth rates of vehicles and fuel in the business models are being prepaid and you can get money from both sides. We're all about getting into places where it's good to be in fuel card. So it's not surprising that we've spent time on Russia, Mexico and Brazil and are focused on those markets. And so I would say you guys should be looking for more of the same. The pipeline that we're working on, again, tends to be outside of here. And we're about it, because we're about trying to get positions in places that can go fast. 
Wayne Johnson: I appreciate that. Have you seen any change in the competitive dynamics domestically? 
Ronald Clarke: Not really. Again, I think we've spoken, Wayne, a bit about this before that there is a lot of segments in the U.S. and kind of the over the road and the big local national account business, the UPS business, those things are pretty mature and we're kind of not in them and they're kind of slugging along with some rate compression. But the small and mid-size that are really distribution-intensive, you've got to have a distribution capability to get up those. That thing is still decent and you can make decent money in it.
 So I'd say the competition in that last space is not with other fuel card guys. It's with credit cards and cash and other kinds of functional payments. So I'd say in the U.S. we continue to like the segment that we play in, which is why we're growing 15%. We're not signing up big wins like UPS or Coke. We're signing up, as I said, in the sales opening thousands and thousands of 15 vehicle accounts, which we like because we like the margin dynamics of those accounts. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the FleetCor Technologies, Inc., First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. We'd like to thank you very much for your participation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2011 Q4  (2012-02-08 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the FleetCor Technologies, Incorporated Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]
 I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Eric Dey, Chief Financial Officer. 
Eric Dey: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. By now, everyone should have access to our fourth quarter and full year 2011 press release. It can also be found at www.fleetcor.com under the Investor Relations section.
 Throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues and adjusted net income. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and maybe calculated differently than other companies similarly titled non-GAAP information. Quantitative reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today's press release and on our website as described previously. Also, we are reviewing 2011 guidance on a non-GAAP basis.
 Finally, before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements. This includes forward-looking statements about our 2011 guidance. They are not guarantees of future performance and therefore, you should not put undue reliance on them. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's 8-K filed with the Security and Exchange Commission. Others are discussed in our Form 10-K, which is available at www.sec.gov.
 With that out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? 
Ronald Clarke: Okay, Eric, thanks. Hello everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I thought I cover 3 subjects in my opening remarks. First, our Q4 results, second, our 2011 full year results and then finally our 2012 guidance and give you bit of a bridge.
 So, first off, our Q4 results; if you had a chance to see our earnings release you will see that Q4 was a very good quarter for us. We reported revenue of $140 million, an all-time quarterly high since the founding of the company. We also reported adjusted net income of $47 million and adjusted EPS of $0.56 per share. All of these results were beat against our own internal plan. And from a growth perspective, our Q4 revenue grew over 30% and adjusted net income more than 25%. So, we finished comfortably ahead of our 10% and 20% targets.
 Now let me shift in to some of the drivers of this Q4 performance. One, we continued rapid growth of our universal card products, our CLC hotel card products and our Russia business. Together these 3 businesses grew revenue a combined 40% for the quarter. So, they continue to grow really, really quickly. Second, the environment continued to help us. Fuel prices were well above prior year levels and US market spreads way above normal for the quarter, adding $3 million to $4 million of incremental revenue.
 Third, the addition of our Mexico and AllStar acquisitions contributed meaningfully to our Q4 revenue, but very little to our Q4 earnings. And then finally we booked a favorable tax rate for the quarter at 26% as we confirmed a couple of tax rulings that reduced our full year tax liability.
 Our fourth quarter also produced particularly strong sales finish. Our U.S. sales grew 40% for the quarter and 25% for the full year. In the non-field channels, things like web and mail grew almost 50% versus the prior year. We also got some sales traction from a new sales partnership with FleetMatics, a GPS tracking company, who recently began selling their own branded version of our universal card. They are adding the fuel card to new sales of their GPS tracking services and we expect this new partnership to add approximately 5% to our 2012 overall U.S. sales.
 Now let me transition to our second subject, our full year 2011 results and let me begin by reminding you of what we set out to do in 2011. We targeted 10 and 20; that is 10% revenue growth and 20% earnings growth for the year. That led to initial revenue guidance of $460 million to $480 million, and we reported approximately $520 million, so $50 million above our midpoint.
 Our initial adjusted EPS guidance was $1.83 to $1.95 and we reported $2.17. So we finished 15% above our midpoint. So, our initial 10% and 20% has turned into 20% and 30% for 2011. These results were driven by executing what we call our 3x3 Strategy; namely we build, we buy and we partner. On the bill front, we grow assets, we own group of volume and rate per transaction and for 2011 transactions grew 12% and revenue per tran grew 8%.
 Next we strive to sign meaningful outsourcing partners. In 2011, we signed Shell, a portfolio measured in volume roughly the size of our entire company and lastly, we buy assets that we know and we can improve. We bought both the Mexican prepaid fuel card company and the AllStar fuel card business in the UK, which we announced in December. Note both the yields are outside of North America, where we said we would focus and both diversify our revenue way from fuel price sensitivity, as they rely on fee-based models. So, you will see us continue to focus our acquisition efforts on emerging markets and on businesses we know.
 Finally, in addition to accomplishing our business objectives last year, we also strengthened the company’s balance sheet. We closed $900 million term loan with BoA of which $600 million is in the form of revolver and our leverage ratio exited Q4 at 1.3x EBITDA. So, we believe this gives us a necessary capital and freedom to continue to pursue attractive acquisitions this year.
 Okay. Let me move on to my final subject, our 2012 outlook. For 2012, we are expecting revenue and adjusted EPS to grow approximately 19% at the midpoint of our guidance. The growth drivers for ‘12 include, one, expected healthy volume increases in a number of our fast growth businesses and that’s consistent with our 2011 performance; two, continued rate enhancement as clients continue to covert to our extended network products; three, the recently announced PHH leasing deal will obviously be additive and four, we will have a full year of our Mexico and AllStar acquisitions, which we previously said should add at least $0.25 combined to our 2012 adjusted EPS. We do expect the macro environment to be less helpful to our 2012 growth rate, as both FX rates and fuel prices look to be leveled with 2011. So, our ‘12 guidance does not rely on the favorable economic conditions that really helped our performance in 2011.
 Finally, in addition to this baseline guidance, you should also look for us to continue to chase new partner outsourcing deals and new emerging market acquisitions. Our pipeline today is quite full all fronts and again, primarily outside of North America.
 So, with that, let me now turn the call back over to Eric to cover our financial results in some more detail. Eric? 
Eric Dey: Thanks Ron. For the fourth quarter of 2011, we reported revenue of $140.2 million, an increase of 32% from the fourth quarter of 2010. For the fourth quarter, GAAP net income increased 116% to $37.8 million from $17.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 or $0.45 per diluted share compared to $0.22 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2010.
 For the full year of 2011, we reported revenue of $519.6 million, an increase of 20% from the full year of 2010. GAAP net income for the full year of 2011 increased 37% to $147.3 million from $107.9 million for the full year of 2010, or $1.76 per diluted share compared to $1.34 per diluted share in 2010. The other financial metrics that we routinely use to measure our business are adjusted revenues and adjusted net income, which we sometimes also refer to cash net income.
 Adjusted revenues equal our GAAP revenues less merchant commissions. We use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate the Company's revenues, net of the commissions that are paid to merchants who participate in certain card programs. Commissions paid to merchants can vary when market spreads fluctuate in much of the same way some of our revenues can vary when market spreads fluctuate. For this reason, we believe the adjusted revenue financial metric is a more effective way to evaluate the Company's performance.
 The reconciliation of adjusted revenues and adjusted net income to our GAAP numbers are provided and exhibit one of our press release. Adjusted net income is GAAP net income adjusting to eliminate non-cash stock based compensation expense related to share based compensation awards, amortization of deferred financing costs and intangible assets. Amortization of the premium recognized in the purchase receivable and the loss on the early extinguishment of debt.
 Adjusted revenues in the fourth quarter of 2011 increased 29% to $125.5 million, compared to $97 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2011 increased 28% to $47.3 million or $0.56 per diluted share, compared to $37.1 million or $0.44 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2010 on a pro forma basis. 2010 adjusted net income on a pro forma basis provides comparability by including the public company expenses included in the fourth quarter of 2011.
 Additional non-cash compensation expense related to our new option plan increases in the effective tax rate to equal the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2011 and fully diluted shares equal to those in the fourth quarter of 2011, all of which are described in exhibit one of our press release.
 Adjusted revenues for the full year of 2011 increased 22% to $468.4 million, compared to $384.8 million for 2010. Adjusted net income for the full year of 2011 increased 31% to $181.7 million or $2.17 per diluted share, compared to $139 million or $1.66 per diluted share for 2010 on a pro forma basis.
 For the fourth quarter of 2011, transaction volume increased 33% to $63.5 million transactions, compared to $47.7 million transactions in the fourth quarter of 2010. Adjusted revenues per transaction for the fourth quarter of 2011 decreased 3% to a $1.97 from $2.04 in the fourth quarter of 2010 due to the impact of acquisitions closed in 2011 which carry lower revenue per transaction product.
 For the full year of 2011, transaction volumes increased 12.8% to 214.8 million transaction compared to 190.4 million transactions in 2010. Adjusted revenues per transaction for the full year of 2011 increased 8.1% or $2.18 from $2.02 in 2010. Adjusted revenue per transaction can vary based on geography, the relevant merchant relationship, the payment product utilized and the type of products or services purchased. The mix of which will be influenced by our acquisitions, organic growth in the business, and fluctuation in environmental factors such as foreign exchange rates, fuel prices, and fuel price spreads.
 Adjusted revenue per transaction for both the quarter and full year were positively impacted by organic growth and certain of our payment programs and the generally positive environmental factors in the quarter such as higher fuel prices and favorable market spreads.
 During the fourth quarter, the company completed the acquisition of AllStar Business Solutions Limited in the UK, which contributed to the increase in transaction volumes and adjusted revenues. Also during the third quarter, the company completed the acquisition of a Mexican prepaid fuel card and food voucher business, which also contributed to the increase in transaction volumes and adjusted revenues.
 Excluding the impact of these acquisitions, our transaction volumes grew in line with prior quarters. However, both the AllStar business in the UK and our business in Mexico produce a lower revenue per transaction product and when combined with our other businesses’ revenues, results in a lower revenue per transaction that would have resulted without the acquisitions. I also want to note that the fourth quarter of 2010 and full year of 2010 transaction volumes and revenues have been adjusted for the wind down of a partner contract in Europe inherited from an acquisition which we chose not to renew. This partner had a high number of transactions and very little revenue. A reconciliation of this contract wind down is contained in Exhibit 2 to the press release.
 Now, let’s shift over and discuss some of the drivers of our fourth quarter performance. First, our combined U.S. fuel card business performed extremely well during the quarter growing nearly 40% compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Helping drive this performance was revenue generated from our direct market MasterCard product, which was up over 50% compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, resulting in higher transaction volumes for the quarter.
 PLC Group, a provider of lodging management programs, had another solid quarter with 30-plus percent revenue growth over the fourth quarter of last year. This increase was primarily [ph] driven by an increase in same-store sales, higher sales volumes, higher margin products, and higher revenues due to the restructuring of certain customer contracts.
 In our international business, our independent fuel card provider based in Russia, PPR continued with its impressive growth trends with revenues approximately 35% over last year. This increase was driven primarily by an increase in same-store sales and strong new customer sales resulting in higher transaction volumes.
 The macroeconomic environment in 2011 also helped increase revenues and profit during the fourth quarter and full year. When we talk about the macroeconomic environment, we are referring to the impact of market spread margins, fuel prices, foreign exchange rates, and the economy in general can have on our business. During the fourth quarter and full year of 2011, these macroeconomic factors were generally positive.
 Now, moving down the income statement, total operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $76 million, compared to $74.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, an increase of 2%. Included in operating expenses are merchant commissions, processing expenses, bad debt, and selling and general administrative expenses. Included in operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2011 were normal operating expenses related to the 2 acquisitions closed in 2011 and approximately $1.2 million of one-time deal-related expenses related to our acquisition activities.
 Credit losses were 20 basis points for the quarter compared to 23 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2010. And on a full year basis, credit losses were 21 basis points, compared to 29 basis points in 2010. The improvement in credit losses was primarily due to the improvement in the economy and a shift in our marketing and sales strategy towards slightly larger fleet prospects.
 Depreciation and amortization increased 17% to $9.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 from $8.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. The increase was primarily due to the impact of amortization of intangible assets related to our acquisition in Mexico in the third quarter of 2011 and the AllStar acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2011.
 Interest expense decreased 18% in the fourth quarter to $3.4 million from $4.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. This decrease was due primarily to the expiration of an interest rate hedge in November 2010 and the favorable impact of refinancing our term loan in June 2011 at a more attractive rate.
 Our effective tax rate increased to 30.1% of pre-tax income for the full year of 2011 compared to 28.7% for the full year 2010. However, in the fourth quarter of 2011, our effective tax rate was only 25.6% due primarily to a number of favorable items including adjustments related to tax plans successfully implemented in foreign jurisdiction where we do business, the reduction in statutory rate in foreign jurisdictions where we do business and the mix of earnings between U.S. and foreign jurisdiction.
 Similarly in the fourth quarter of 2010, our effective tax was only 13.1% also due to a number of favorable items including the mix of earnings between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, reduction in the statutory rate in foreign jurisdictions where we do business and the impact of the reduction in the reserve for uncertain tax position.
 Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $341 million of total cash, $56 million of which is restricted in our primarily customer deposits. The company also has a $500 million accounts receivable securitization facility. At the end of the quarter, we had $280 million drawn on the facility and the ability to draw an additional $26 million based on eligible receivables pledged against the facility.
 On February 6, we amended and extended our facility termination date until February 2013. The renewal included a reduction in the facilities interest rate from CP plus 90 basis points to CP plus 75 basis points and also included a reduction in our unused line fee. The current purchase limit remained at $500 million. We also have $293 million outstanding in our term loan and $125 million drawn on our $600 million revolver. As of December 31, our leverage ratio was 1.3x EBITDA, a slight increase from 1.1x at the end of the third quarter. The increase was due to borrowing on our revolving credit facility related to the purchase of the AllStar business in December. However, our leverage ratio remained well below our covenant level of 3.25x EBITDA. The company intends to continue to use its free cash flow to temporarily pay down the balance on revolving credit facility and securitization facility and maintain liquidity for acquisitions and other corporate purposes.
 Finally, we are not a capital-intensive business. As we spend approximately $5 million on CapEx during the fourth quarter of 2011 and approximately $13.5 million for the full year of 2011. Now, onto our outlook for 2012. For 2012 we are expecting revenue to be between $615 million and $625 million, adjusted net income to be between $217 million and $222 million, and adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $2.55 and $2.60. Some of the assumptions that we made in preparing our 2012 guidance include the following.
 We are assuming that the macroeconomic environment will provide some challenges in 2012, when we compare it to our 2011 performance. As an example, foreign exchange rates are currently running lower than the 2012 average and we assumed that trend to continue in 2012. We assume market spreads to be consistent with the last 3-year average, which is lower than 2011. And we assumed fuel prices to be flat to the 2011 average.
 We are also assuming a 0.2% increase in our effective tax rate from 30.1% in 2011 to 30.3% in 2012, an increase of 1.5 million diluted shares outstanding from 83.7 million shares in 2011, to 85.2 million shares in 2012. And finally, this guidance does not reflect the impact of any future acquisitions or material new partnership agreements. The full-year guidance produces a 19% full year 2012 revenue and cash earnings growth rate at the midpoint of our guidance range versus 2011.
 I would like to remind everyone that included in 2011 is the impact of a macroeconomic environment that was favorable in fuel price, market spread margins, and foreign exchange rate. And I mentioned earlier, we are assuming that the environment will be more challenging in 2012.
 For those of you that are looking for guidance for the first quarter, I want to remind everyone that our business has some seasonality and typically the first and fourth quarters are lower than the second and third quarters in both revenue and profit. With that said, we are expecting our first quarter adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $0.56 and $0.59. We have no plans to provide quarterly guidance going forward, but provide this guidance to help you understand our seasonality.
 And with that said operator, we will open it up to questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: I guess I’ll ask about the conservatives and then the guidance, just want to take your temperature on that Ron and Eric. If we, because we strip out I guess the AllStar and the Mexico deal, looks like it implies some high-single digit EPS organic growth. Is that accurate? I’m just curious if the macro conservatism that you talked about was enough to bring it down to that level. 
Eric Dey: Hey, Tien-Tsin, this is Eric. There’s a number of reasons for that. Let me see if I can explain them to you, I guess first if you look at it from a GAAP perspective. Our GAAP net income was actually up about 25% over 2011 and the reason for that is our cash compensation -- our non-cash compensation expense between 2011 and 2012 was actually decreasing. And as a result of that decrease, it actually impacts the adjusted net income on a cash basis.
 We also have an increase in our number of shares outstanding in 2012 versus 2011, which is also impacting the calculation. Thirdly, the acquisitions that we completed in 2011 have a lower margin than does the rest of our businesses today and obviously as we get into 2011, we’re going to be working on those business to bring those margins more in line with the company’s line average.
 And then finally, we’ve taken a bit of a conservative view, when we take a look at the macroeconomic environment, looking into 2012 primarily as it relates to FX rates. FX rates are currently running a little bit lower than the average was in 2011 and our average spreads in 2011 were higher than like the last 3-year average. So, we took a little bit more conservative view on those as well. I think those things combined resulted in where we were from a guidance perspective. 
Ronald Clarke: And Tien-Tsin, it’s Ron. We obviously want to give you a number we can make. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Sure, understood. Did the 10% and 20% still sort of apply here, longer term? 
Ronald Clarke: Yes, I think if you strip out all the words that Eric said, you ought to think about the organic businesses comparable with ’11. So we peel back all the detail. I tell you that our view is the businesses are growing basically the same if you kind of chuck out the environment. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Okay, you have cleansed for everything. Okay, understood. Last, just the implied sort of same-store assumption in Europe. I mean, are you seeing things deteriorate there, ignoring FX of course, what’s happening on the ground in Europe? 
Eric Dey: Tien-Tsin, this is Eric again. Yes, I would say that same-store sales across Central Europe are running, meaning in the UK and our Czech Republic business are running probably flat to down somewhat in 2011 and we expect that trend to continue into 2012. 
Ronald Clarke: But I would say here Tien-Tsin, it’s Ron, that we mentioned this in the last, I think in the last call, the nose of the plane is up a bit in the U.S. but it’s not everywhere. The California market is still not great, but I’d say we are on the plus side now in the U.S. fuel card same-store. Finally, that thing is up. 
Eric Dey: And obviously too, just add onto that, our same-store sales in Russia are actually extremely well. Doing extremely well right now. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Wayne Johnson with Raymond James. 
Wayne Johnson: Could you just comment on the, your guys’ appetite for further acquisitions in South America and could you also just give an indication on kind of the business climate there and I have one follow-up. 
Ronald Clarke: Wayne, it’s Ron. High, would be the headline, and again, we like markets with the model setup well, not only of payments early in the cycle, but the model in terms of basically the way the economics work, particularly in Brazil are pretty attractive. So, I’d say both Mexico which you talked about the last time and South America are interesting to us. 
Wayne Johnson: Alright. And so on that, so Brazil being the most attractive market, can you give us any sense, do you guys have anything in the pipeline or in your sites? 
Ronald Clarke: Yes, I wouldn’t comment on actually a country, but I would say if you pulled up the public comps, there is a couple of public comps, CL and ReadyCard, you can see kind of their growth rates in acquiring and in processing are very good, but we are obviously, I think I have said this repeatedly, we’ve been in the business for 11 years so we know every company basically everywhere and as I've said to you, we are in conversations. We are about trying to buy assets we like to. You should assume if there are people anywhere we are talking to. 
Wayne Johnson: And that would include the United States? 
Ronald Clarke: Yes, I’d say again it’s less interesting Wayne, as we’ve said before mostly again, because of the market dynamics, right? The country here it’s more penetrated and the model is obviously more competitive, the more players doing what we do here, but again if there was an interesting property here, we would look at it, but I’d say we like the looks of properties in other markets more. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Phil Stiller with Citi. 
Philip Stiller: On the AllStar acquisition, what was the revenue contribution in the quarter? And then as we think about 2012, can you give us a sense in terms of how much you guys are investing in the platform consolidation there and what kind of long-term savings that should drive? 
Eric Dey: First Phil, just to remind everybody, we closed the AllStar acquisition on December 13. So, it had very little contribution both from -- well first, from a revenue perspective and it had no contribution from a profitability standpoint as we booked a bunch of deal costs in conjunction with closing the transaction. So, there was nothing from a profit standpoint. And it was single digit millions in total revenue for the quarter -- for the month really. 
Ronald Clarke: Phil, it’s Ron. On the second part of the question I’d say the 2 places that we are investing. One is in technology, so the way to think about it is they have some kind of baseline run-rate of what they are spending, right, to run the systems and enhance the systems they have. And we are basically spending money to basically tailor and implement our technology, so that would be kind of an incremental spend this one year. And then same on sales, they basically spend relative to their base significantly less than we do. And so and they use much a narrower set of channels to acquire customers than we do. So, we’re going to both spend more in total and we are going to introduce some new channels, new ways to acquire accounts that they don’t currently use. 
Philip Stiller: You guys have a rough timeframe as to when you could get that business to kind of inline margins relative to the overall business? 
Ronald Clarke: I’d say a fair amount of it hinges on the technology, but I’d say that we’re going to obviously go carefully, but I'd say, as we exit this year we’ll probably be 1/3 to 1/2 of the way and probably you get to a year from there we’ll be 2/3 of the way would be kind of a guestimate for you. 
Philip Stiller: Okay, great. On the North American business, you had strong increases in revenue per transaction for third quarter consecutive quarter and it’s been relatively consistent sequentially since that time. Are the comps that much more difficult after we get through the first quarter or you are expecting further increases on that metric, going forward? 
Ronald Clarke: Yes, again it’s a mix Phil, its environment right has given some with the higher fuel price or higher spreads, but b, it’s the product mix that we go to, so we’re selling and have converted. We have a lot more of extended network cards that we earn more revenue. So over the prior period, we have a greater mix of higher profit products in our base now. So I think we told you we’re probably 75% of the way through that set of conversion so we expect that to keep rolling into 2012. 
Eric Dey: Phil, I think to answer your question overall, I think we expect that obviously revenue per transaction to continue to grow on both of our businesses in the U.S. and both internationally as well. 
Philip Stiller: Okay, great. Last question from me, any update on the Shell implementation and when we should expect revenue from that deal? 
Ronald Clarke: That’s a good question. I would say we’re on track with the plan at the end of the second quarter. We’re planning to basically go live in the first market. It’s actually a market that Shell has picked in Asia. And then basically kind of as we get into the fall, the plan is to start to implement some other bigger European markets. So kind of starting Q3 and Q4 you should see transactions start to increase from Shell. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And I show no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you very much for your participation and you may now disconnect.
